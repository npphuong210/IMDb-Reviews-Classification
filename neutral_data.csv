tt5611024,5.0,"I felt like the beginning started out decently and there were some good twists in first couple of episodes but then there were plot holes big enough to drive a truck through by the end...
One massive plot hole is the nanny cam frame... How did the Burkett's even know it existed to ""deep fake"" it?? Maya's friend gave her the frame, so they would have had no knowledge of it's true purpose unless the nanny happened to take out the SD card and check it (which they never showed her doing, nor do I remember her explaining that she did)
Just doesn't make sense...
And the daughter was 4 but would she not have remembered the Nanny's husband showing up and talking to her in her dad's clothes??Shane's character's behavior also makes zero sense. It's hinted at that he's secretly in love with her at the beginning, but then he gets all stalkerish in the middle (mainly it seems only to further the points of implying it might be Joe stalking her. A point they lean into when the little girl runs over to the bushes and says ""Daddy"" which is never explained... as well as Shane conveniently showing up in the garage which he otherwise would have had no knowledge of)
Then he just turns into a convenient delivery guy to drop off the nanny and husband or whatever he was off. He then disappears until the last scene where he pops up 18 years later as the devoted (and apparently ageless friend)
And then there's all the subplots that go nowhere..Maya's friend who gives her the frame and is supposedly her good friend is missing from the final scene and her subplot about her ex husband just disappears..And the half-sibling plot seems no purpose other than to make Claire seem more secretive and give her kids something to do... and why introduce the half siblings father and not actually show them meeting?And the whole younger detective relationship they build ends so abruptly with zero resolution as well...And that's just a fraction of the issues...."
tt5611024,5.0,"Apart from the fact that the lead actor Michelle Keegan in this series seems to have only one gear and one expression throughout the entire 8 episodes, despite some very high stakes, I found the story itself thrilling albeit farfetched. But SO SO odd that a lead actor can get away with not giving more than this, as if what we're seeing is a walk through rehearsal from her rather than the final product. A really bland performance. Do the two (male) directors imagine that the actor's attractiveness is enough?!! That viewers wont wonder why she seems so strangely disconnected?Adeel Akhtar on the other hand is an absolute joy to watch as always."
tt5611024,6.0,"Seems to be a trend making limited series that don't need 8-10 episodes! First episode gets you hooked but you see the signs of the long drawn-out development being framed.Being fooled in the past from other shows, I now look for reviews that recommend the episodes to skip, that don't provide critical information. The reason for the 6 is the unnecessary episodes.If you watch episode 1, and skip to last two 7,8... the rating goes up to a 8 for me. No critical information is missing and I like the ending, they tied up most of the plot lines.Overall a great show, a little overly dramatized for a UK show which tends to be ground compared to US TV."
tt5611024,5.0,"I am always pulled in to anything that stars, Richard Armitage. I have enjoyed the previous Harlan Corben adaptations to the British format. I personally don't see a problem with that, especially as the screenplay had been adapted by Danny Brocklehurst. He's a talented writer. I've lived in Manchester and quite enjoyed the familiarity of the place.My biggest problem with this series was Michelle Keegan... I don't know where to begin. Her face is so distracting and detracts from the role she's trying to play, and I use the word ""trying"" loosely! She should really stick to soap operas as she offered no gravitas to the role she was supposed to be playing. The rest of the cast were fair enough ... even though we didn't see too much of Richard Armitage! Joanna Lumley was cool .. I thought she did well.Adeel Akhtar stole the show ... he is exceptional in everything he is in, and I was drawn in by his character and life circumstances. Him being on the Burkett meds was a reasonable twist.. and I honestly didn't see that coming! His side kick was good and they had good chemistry.The ending was stupid ...totally unnecessary!It could have been told in 4 episodes , but like most Netflix series they like to stretch it out!!"
tt5611024,5.0,"I'm probably about three-quarters through, and I'll stick it out just because I want to see how it wraps up. I wonder if Harlan Coben is ever consulted on the scripts for his adaptations. I would be embarrassed if I were him. If you can get past the bad writing in this adaptation and just go with the plot, you'll be okay. You can't blame the actors, who do a decent job. The issues I have with this production are too many to list.Did the writers deliberately try to make Maya seem uneducated, or did third graders write this: ""Me and Lily will be fine."" ""Me and Judith don't get along."" Good grief.So many things don't ring true with the characters' behaviors, it's ridiculous. What's with the male friend who is always hanging around Maya and her daughter, and why does she just accept that (I wouldn't). How does he get into her house, like he lives there? Why does she go off sleuthing on her own, not sharing clues with the detective, who seems sympathetic? Oh yes, and we have the obligatory gay cop. Gotta get that in there.I always watch Harlan Coben's adaptations and I do like most of them, but this one is just pretty dumb."
tt5611024,5.0,"Well I think the title says it all. A series that tries to make a hero out of the most unlikable character of any production I have ever watched.The protagonist is a suspected war criminal, who uses violence constantly, holds innocent people at gunpoint to make them answer her questions, hides evidence from the cops, etc.. And the series insists on portraying her as a hero, which is infuriating.The entire series is littered with inconsistencies. For instance, in the first episode Maya thinks her husband might be alive and suddenly in the second episode she's trying to convince her sister-in-law that he's dead!!! A whistle blower who released some damning videos about Maya is sitting on evidence that he will not share with the cops. Instead, he shares them willingly with Maya; the person he blew the whistle on! Why would he do that?At one point in the series, Maya's child is screaming and she's clearly in distress. Instead of running to her child, Maya wakes up, runs to the gun cabinet, calmly puts on her gloves, picks up a gun, and just stands there for a few seconds giving a determined look to the camera and then slowly goes to help her child. What kind of a mother does that? If you want people to watch the show and like it, you have to give them a reason to root for the protagonist, not several reasons to despise her.All in all, do not watch. I wasted my time, don't waste yours."
tt12964320,5.0,Role Play is a pretty bad comedy action film about a wife who is an assassin and hiding the secret from her husband and family. Until her past catches up to her and she has to step in and fight for her familys safety.The plot is forgettable with its tedious script. The plot is similiar to The Family Plan except at least the humor and fun in that film is worth watching. This film lacks the humor and when it tries for laughs it is just pure awkward. The action sequences are boring. The cast ensemble is forgettable. It is nice to see Katey going for the action role. But the script and direction gives them nothing to work with.It is a boring action film that has a eh story. Boring action and tedious performances.
tt12964320,5.0,"Role Play tells the story of a married couple who decide to have a night out that reveals to a secret revealed that will shake them to their core.Overall this movie isn't strong in any aspect. I feel like the casting of David Oyelowo as the husband was not a good choice. He has almost no chemistry with Kaley Cuoco and I don't buy that these two are married. These two are the heart of the film and I just think it's hard to get invested in them.Characters in general are very inconsistent, weakly written so that they can do what the script needs them to do. Timid/rational in one scene, brave/irrational the next. The ""ruthless criminals"" feel like were lifted from a rated PG TV movie.I do think some of the film is fun and the set up is intriguing, if ultimately bland. I love Bill Nighy so he was a welcome surprise and makes the best scene in the movie. I was fairly engaged throughout the movie and it went by fairly quickly.Overall this is a straight to streaming quality movie that doesn't do its premise as well as others like Mr. And Mrs. Smith. It is a skip."
tt12964320,5.0,"There are a number of low ratings and negative reviews for this movie and to me they missed the whole point of this movie. It is mostly a comedy, not to be taken so seriously. My wife and I were entertained.Kaley Cuoco, who also produced, is the star as Emma Brackett. She is married with two children. She goes out of town on ""business"" trips but it not the traditional business. Nor is it the career her husband thinks she has. As the trailer for the movie clearly points out, she is an assassin.She is married to David Oyelowo as Dave Brackett. He is a standard, honest man. One night when he and Emma decide to do something different, they go to a hotel to pretend to be strangers, meet at a bar, and end up in a hotel room together. However that ""date"" doesn't go as planned. It sets the tone for the rest of the movie.Bill Nighy is good in everything he is in. Here he is Bob Kellerman who also shows up at the bar. He starts flirting with Emma. In the conversation he drops word hints. It soon becomes obvious to her that he knows who she is and he is in the same profession.Things develop from there, Emma's husband finds out what she really does, he is mortified. He can't believe it. In the end it becomes a fight for survival.We watched it at home, streaming on Amazon Prime. Viewed as a dark comedy we found it suitably entertaining."
tt12964320,5.0,"This is basically a gender swap of Mark Wahlburg's ""Family Plan"", but without the same level of humor or action. The lead actors are fine, the action sequences are well done but waaaay too short. The story is predictable, the humorous bits garner a chuckle at best. It's great to see Kaley branch out, but this doesn't come close to her performance in ""Flight Attendant"" on Apple TV. I think she deserves a bigger audience, and I'll continue waiting for her to find that true breakout role so she'll no longer just be Penny from The Big Bang Theory. As others have said, it makes for some fine background noise, but ultimately is pretty forgettable."
tt12964320,6.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. The spouse living a double life is territory covered many times by many movies over many years. When done well, it's an intriguing premise and fertile ground for a fascinating character - one who can flip the switch between a 'normal' family life and one of intense danger. What's rare is for the oblivious spouse to be the more interesting character, yet that's exactly what happens in this film from director Thomas Vincent and screenwriter Seth W Owen.Kaley Cuoco stars as Emma Brackett, and David Oyelowo co-stars as her husband, Dave. Ms. Cuoco shot to fame with her role as Penny on the long-running TV series ""The Big Bang Theory"", which she followed up with leading roles in ""The Flight Attendant"" and ""Harley Quinn"". This is her latest shot at establishing herself as a movie actress. Mr. Oyelowo is best known for his dramatic turns in SELMA (2014) and THE MIDNIGHT SKY (2020), and the new series ""Lawmen: Bass Reeves"".Emma is a contract assassin who works all over the world using disguises (mostly wigs) and aliases, while telling Dave, the nicest, most trusting man on Earth, that she is off to yet another generic work conference in Nebraska or some other unexciting locale. When home, Emma is a good mother to their two kids, and clearly enjoys their life in suburban New Jersey. When work beckons, Dave unwittingly accepts her reason for travel, having no clue that she'll return with blood on her hands.On their seventh anniversary, Dave suggests they spice things up a bit with some role play. Their planned 'happenstance' meeting as strangers at a hotel bar goes sideways thanks to the intrusion of an unwelcome third wheel named Bob Kellerman. The always fabulous Bill Nighy plays Kellerman, and we find ourselves wishing he had more screen time. It turns out, this encounter leads to Emma being outed, which sends Dave into emotional turmoil (a terrific scene) ... and an ill-advised meetup at her latest job.Additional support work is provided by Connie Nielsen as the demented woman who raised and trained Emma, and their final meeting provides the impetus for the third act. Other than Bill Nighy's too-brief role, the best part of the film is seeing rare comedic chops from David Oyelowo. It's a joy to see such a well-respected and talented actor show yet another side on screen. Kaley Cuoco doesn't fare quite as well, as her TV sitcom approach defies believability. For those in search of some mindless entertainment with a side dose of action, the movie should work just fine.Opens nationwide in theaters on January 12, 2024."
tt12964320,5.0,"I'm not sure if it's intentional, but this is one of the least chemistry couples I've seen in a while. That affects absolutely the entire film. If they don't mention it in the movie, you never know it's a marriage. Cuoco's performance is probably the reason for this, because apart from the action scenes, her participation is quite flat. Understandably, she is a cold-blooded professional, but you are in front of your husband, the reason why you want to get out of the shady business!Regarding technical details, only the photography and production design are redeemable. The script, editing and soundtrack are pretty bad. For a 100-minute film, they stretch it like chewing gum to become a feature-length film. A truly horrible edition.Anyway. It doesn't make me want to recommend a movie like this, because it is neither action nor spy, nor a drama."
tt12964320,5.0,"For seven years, Emma Brackett (Kaley Cuoco) has been married to mild-mannered Dave Brackett (David Oyelowo) with two kids in the suburbs. Secretly, she is a killer for hire. She escaped from twisted mother-figure Gwen Carver (Connie Nielsen) who runs a powerful black-ops organization. While the couple is meeting at a hotel, they are interrupted by assassin Bob Kellerman (Bill Nighy) looking for a bounty.This is trying to be an action-comedy thriller. This premise is nothing new. The only new here is the pairing of Cuoco and Oyelowo. Color me intrigued. I like both actors. I want to see their chemistry together. First issue, Cuoco is the far more comedic actor and she is forced to play the straight-downcast partner. Oyelowo can go crazy wacky, but he's not equipped to be comedic. They need to switch for the humor. This movie needs more humor. Bill Nighy has some fun potential, but he comes and goes too quickly. Connie Nielsen does fine, but she is rather alone. The premise has been done so many times and this is a rather flat version of it."
tt12964320,5.0,"This is a decent and fun ""Foul Play"" style comedic thriller about a suburban family, where the wife turns out to be a hired assassin living a dual life. It is the ""Mrs"" in ""Mr. & Mrs Smith"". Kaley Cuocco is very likable, as always, in the role of a woman trying to balance these two lives. She is always so appealing and she is a good actress. She makes the role her own. David Oyelowo is actually part of the strength of the movie. He is good as the husband that discovered his wife's business trips are not what they seem. Billy Nighy's scenes are the highlights of the movie. Not realistic. The fight choreography is not ""A"" level by any stretch of the imagination but still fun."
tt12964320,6.0,"Why is Role Play getting some backlash? Pretty sure it's because of the genre the audience is expecting before even hitting the play button. If viewing the film from a different perspective then there are plenty of merits on display here.One being the performances and the chemistry between the actors/actresses. Kaley Cuoco has it in abundance, I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's there I can feel it. Maybe it adaptability, sophistication or sassy sexiness emulating from one scene to another, still clearly she has it here. I'm going in pretty blind as I haven't seen much of her previous work, no Big Bang or Flight Attendant! Secondly David Oyelowo matches her well and their on screen chemistry appears second nature to me. I think one review mentioned they seem cute together, I don't know about that however I do know they seem believable. I didn't doubt their onscreen relationship for one minute which is exactly what you want to get engrossed into a film.Now going back to adaptability, Kaley Cuoco embraces the role managing to create a balance between cute cuddly lovable wife and mum to deadly badass assassin. When she get down to business she is strong assertive and bold juxtaposed with being playful and cute at home. David Oyelowo manages to bring emotional empathy within the script through his acting once finding out about the truth. What was once his normal family life has a huge flip side that we can see in his expressions is troublesome to say the least.So who steals the film with the standout scene, it's obviously none other than Bill Nighy. The man in the middle of this triangle has the standout scene of the film in the bar. A slow burner or so in the first twenty minutes soon well and truly warms up with a little Role Play, no pun intended. Soon as the get to the title it gets rather interesting.Script is where this one struggles for me, I'd say our cast made their own character development and produced mountains out of molehills. It's not until the later that you realise if not for the charisma and humour this could've been way more bland than a two steak, and that isn't me being tough. Seth W. Owen needed a better character development arc to suggest why Emma Brackett (Kaley Cuoco) was unable to leave sooner from being an assassin, yes it does explain, yet it all very loose lacking depth or much interest. Dave Brackett (David Oyelowo) really seems weak running all the way to Berlin for an explanation after all he has heard and been through. Yes I understand it's his wife, it just seemed rather forced.Thomas Vincent has given us something intriguing for the most part similar to films like Mr and Mrs Smith and True Lies however this one really does fall short towards the climax and is saved by the talented cast of characters they created."
tt12964320,5.0,"An uneven script, uncertain directing, and bad casting let this picture down badly. It is a shame, really. Kaley Cuoco, however I don't like her, does a great job as so does David Oyelowo to convince us about a story barely believable. But casting Connie Nielsen as the villain is a very bad joke. It's like casting Sir David Attenborough as Lex Luthor. Her pure physical presence contradicts that. I guess it's the director fault to accept her as the villain in the first place. Then, he rightly proves himself unable to bring out the 'beast' of her, which is understandable. She is nothing like that. The camerawork is OK, so is the score, but otherwise it's just another film you will forget almost instantly after watching. As I said earlier, it's a shame. Waste of talent."
tt8258502,5.0,"It's 2065. Water is scarced. People are moving to space. Hen (Saoirse Ronan) and Junior (Paul Mescal) live on his farm which his family has owned for five generations. Farming is a struggle and he works at a chicken factory. There is tension in the marriage. Out of the blue, Terrance (Aaron Pierre) comes to their door. He's recruiting for space pioneers and maybe do a little threatening on top of that.There is an interesting sci-fi concept and an intriguing reveal somewhere in this movie. I can't buy the undercooked sci-fi concept. As a mystery, the movie is holding back a few pieces in the puzzle and the audience is kept waiting. The terrific pairing of Mescal and Ronan is giving it their all, but the movie keeps going in circles. The surrealism mounts until the movie goes down the drain."
tt8258502,5.0,"My Review- Foe
My Rating. 5/10The impressive acting by the trio of stars in Foe from Saorise Ronan and Paul Mescal and Aaron Pierre couldn't salvage this angst ridden dystopian self indulgent melodrama for me .For me this movie is a confusing mish mash of scenes that at times reminded me of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf meets Frankenstein at The Rocky Horror Show.Set in 2065 For's about the sad lives of a young couple Hen played by Saorise Ronanand her husband Junior played by Paul Mescal who oddly works in a poultry abattoir as he's married to a Hen.Filmed in Victoria and South Australia Foe takes place in Americas MidWest and tells the story of a married couple living a life of isolation in a wasteland that's been denuded of any vegetation as a result of the neglect that our planet is experiencing today .A stranger named Terence drives up to their home knocks on the door and tells them the good news that Junior has been chosen because of his obvious fitness and strength to be part of a relocation exercise for Earthlings to find another planet to ruin.Terence assures Junior that Hen will not be left alone as an artificial replacement for Junior complete with all his physical prowess and his memories will take his place while he's away .That's enough plot line the emotional drama then increases as Terence interviews the couple about every intimate part of their relationship warts and all which only uncovers more tension and angst.The novel Foe which I haven't read by Iain Reid is promoted as a taut, psychological mind-bender from the bestselling author of I'm Thinking of Ending Things.The screen play adaptation of the movie by Garth Davis and Iain Reid in my opinion is sloppy and at times mind numbing instead of mind bending .The Direction by Garth Davis considering his previous great movies like Lion and Penguin Bloom I found disappointing it seemed to steer this space ship out of orbit.However the chemistry and charisma of Saorise Ronan and Paul Mescal who is shirtless most of the movie was impressive and I hope they team up again in a better film.Will some author please write an uplifting story set in a future where Politicians and populations overcome the terrible future scenario we are told is inevitable today ?Perhaps it's too late? But the old saying of what we eat today walks and talks tomorrow could be changed to what we think today will become tomorrow comes to mind I'm pleased I won't be here to see it ."
tt8258502,5.0,"This film about a couple living in isolation on a desolate landscape and contemplating the possibility of one of them going to space, leaving behind an identical android ""copy"", has two major advantages and one fatal flaw:(a) It's wonderfully acted, with an electric chemistry between all three main actors.(b) The setting (a house in the middle of a dystopian wasteland) is really atmospheric, both claustrophobic and melancholically beautiful.(c) The screenplay is a disaster. And the lack of originality in the premise is the least of its problems.Ronan and Mescal are two of the best actors of their generation, and I was eagerly waiting to see them act opposite each other. They did the absolute best they could with what they had: two characters without clear background, without foundations, completely lacking transparency in motives and internal journeys. Still, the chemistry was palpable and somewhat rescued what would have otherwise been a completely lifeless film.I watched a review (by Mark Kermode) saying that the film is doing wonderfully up until 2/3 of the way through, when the endless exposition starts and all the magic and mystery is lost. I disagree. I found this film lacking from the very beginning, because you had this wonderful atmosphere that could have felt like watching an intense 3-person stage play, but the dialogues were all wrong. Boring, full of clichés, and establishing nothing. We see the characters have unexplained emotional outbursts, we get contradictory clues about their relationships, the ""mystery"" (you can see the plot twist coming from a mile away) is badly built, no gradual progression.This terribly contrived and pretentious screenplay made me think of Kurt Vonnegut's simple advice for writing: ""Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To hell with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages."" Suspense is not such a bad thing, of course. But when it's prioritised over building comprehensible characters, then things start to go wrong. And it's funny that for a film that hides so much from the viewer in the first two acts, it sure loves exposition in the third act. Like, it goes from one extreme to the other with nothing in between, and with both extremes utterly failing to arouse any emotions.What a waste."
tt8258502,5.0,"Phenomenal acting, a pure masterclass of the two (Ronan and Mescal), directing, plot, script- 0 points. Such great actors in such a pointless movie, with no storyline, a wannabe artistic masterpiece, but it just doesn't go over the ramp.Excellent movie for acting students, as well as the directing ones - how to not direct a movie.For the rest of the world -skip it, unless you are a die-hard fan.Interstellar, but from AliExpress, with a pinch of marriage drama and kilos of boredom, with acting masterclass.Don't have anything else to say, this one is just for the minimum character limit's sake."
tt8258502,6.0,"Anyone think this reminds them of a poor relation of ""Interstellar""? ""Hen"" (Saoirse Ronan) lives on her remote family farm with husband ""Junior"" (Paul Mescal). You get the impression it's a pretty mundane existence and maybe not have been the strongest of relationships when a stranger in what looks like an old De Lorean arrives. It turns out that ""Terrance"" (Aaron Pierre) has come from the supra-governmental agency that's in charge of populating space - yep, the planet is on it's last legs - and that ""Junior"" has been selected to go live upstairs leaving is wife behind. No chance says ""Junior"", no choice says ""Terrance"" but there is some silver lining for ""Hen"". They will make her a carbon copy of her husband to ""keep her company"" whilst he is away. To that end, their visitor must remain for a few weeks to gather information on every intimate detail of their lives together so that ""Junior 2"" can be as authentic as possible. Now we don't actually know this, but it's safe to assume that somewhere in the ensuing proceedings, there is a body swap otherwise the rather dreary and drawn out denouement would make even less sense that it actually does. Is this suppose to be a crit on the nature of human relationships, or of the human psyche? If you went to bed at night and awoke to an identical partner that had been swapped in the night, would you even know? That's the problem. It's a complete non-story that limbers towards it's conclusion without really engaging on any level. That said, man-of-the-moment Mescal does turn in an emotional performance at times, but Ronan is really rather wasted here and the thinly developed characterisation of ""Terrance"" just further consigns this to the doldrums of what looks a short story laggardly dragged out for all but two hours. It's a slow and rather listless film for the most part and contains nothing new. Disappointing."
tt0110912,6.0,I heard so many people claim that this movie is a masterpiece and it also has high ratings. So I was intrigued to give it a go. I didn't get much enjoyment out of it. Maybe you have to watch it multiple times to enjoy it. As for the first viewing it didn't satisfy me.
tt1375666,6.0,"The film is a disappointment, because it did so little with so much. Basically what you have here is a very interesting sci-fi heist premise; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are partners who use dream-invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers (why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit, is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise) while they doze. In exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against Cobb, they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission: to practice ""inception"" on a powerful business scion, that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation.All of this is great, but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight. To find that we have to look into the mystery of why Cobb has been in exile, and this plot has to do with his wife (Marion Cotillard) with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing. This is to me where the movie essentially falls apart. It seems like Nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film, so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa. At no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa. And in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where Cobb shows his new assistant Ariadne (Ellen Page, too green to hold up her role) a lot of the action becomes outright tedious, never more so than when we're ""treated"" to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snow-mobile and gunfight action, right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax. It all starts to feel very obligatory, and Nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like fun.As a basic action/heist movie with sci-fi premise, it still works well enough that I would recommend it as a rental. Nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level, such as the association with totems and icons (the spinning wheel, etc.) and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity. However when all the pieces are laid out, the film seems overly simple and mechanical. The plot is just this -- the guy takes a job, he does the job, he gets to re-unite with his kids. Although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died, he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to Cillian Murphy's character, even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of Ken Watanabe's character. I was hoping that some larger picture would emerge, but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic. The constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel I was watching a bad Spielberg film. The entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true Spielberg fashion. If you don't buy into this ridiculous soft-target hook, then the whole film collapses like DiCaprio's dream world.This isn't a bad or stupid film, but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor, which is almost always missing from Nolan's films. The characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating, especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously. Basically this is like ""Total Recall"" in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes, except that it takes itself hugely seriously. It does not become a better film by doing so, nor a more intelligent one."
tt1375666,5.0,"The central idea of ""Inception"" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, ""Inception"" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that's never gonna happen, but it's *my* dream.)"
tt1375666,5.0,"""Inception"" might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of ""The Prestige"" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like ""The Dark Knight"") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support. ""Inception"" is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-"
tt11762114,6.0,"For those of you who are fans of the Broadway musical, here is a list of the missing music:
""It Roars"" (replaced with a song that's not as good)
""Where Do You Belong?"" (What were they thinking by leaving out this showstopper?!)
""Meet The Plastics"" (Only Regina's first few verses were sung. Gretchen & Karen's parts were cut)
""Fearless""
""Stop"" (Again, what were they thinking by cutting out a showstopper?)
""What's Wrong With Me"" (reprise)
""Whose House Is This?""
""More Is Better""
""Do This Thing""This is supposed to be a film version of the musical, not a remake of the original fetch & flawless film. So, leaving out so many songs was a bad idea. The characters all suffered from this choice; they all seemed too bland.Cady did not sing ""Apex Predator."" Instead, Damian sang ""And though Janice is great, she does not have this power,"" while Janice shrugged. This was such a poor choice, because we didn't see Cady falling under Regina's spell. Gretchen's changing relationship with Regina didn't play out well. The actress who played Gretchen captured the character when she spoke, but when she sang ""What's Wrong With Me"" in Regina's closet, it just didn't make me feel for her. Something got lost in translation.A lot of the comedy was lost in this version. Although ""Sexy"" was filmed well, Karen just wasn't as funny as she was in the 1st movie or the Broadway version. Damian wasn't as funny; without his biggest songs, he didn't shine.""Fearless"" may not have been the biggest hit song, but I felt the loss of it. There needed to be a sharply hit moment when Cady realizes she is the new Queen Bee, freed of her oppressive relationship with Regina. The original film used voiceover to convey that realization and the musical used the song ""Fearless."" The film musical kind of glossed it over.Another thing that was missing was the image of all the plastics walking together, all looking beautiful and glamorous. ""Being in the Plastics was like being famous."" On Broadway, ""Apex Predator"" captured that feel, but in this movie, the song focused on Regina alone and lost the power of the clique.The Plastics just weren't feminine enough. Everyone looked too tough. It was like this version took place at the ""south side"" school that the principal said he left in the original. Even the nerds didn't seem nerdy enough. Regina started out looking like she had already been eating Calteen bars for months and we didn't see her change after Cady tricked her.The chemistry between Cady and Aaron also did not come through. Leaving out ""More Is Better"" and the Aaron's part in ""Stupid With Love"" didn't help.""I See Stars"" was a magical finale on Broadway, but this film did not end with musical magic.What did I like? ""Revenge Party"" was still lots of fun and it was filmed in a colorful way. ""World Burn"" was done well, and ""I'd Rather Be Me"" had a great energy."
tt11762114,6.0,"I really wanted to like this one. I really did. I love the original, and of course, i know this is a different movie, based on the Broadway musical based on the original (and all written by Tina Fey). Of course i know that there was no need for a direct remake, since the original was near perfection. However, this just didn't work. There was no chemistry, no motivation for the characters. I did like that it's done from Damian and Janice's point of view. But the rest of it feels flat.The positives - Renee Rapp has a voice on her, as does Jeremy Spivey. For me they were the highlights of the show. There are some cute moments. Some new lines, but nothing really memorable or quotable.So, meh. It was OK."
tt11762114,5.0,"So this movie really tried but the downside is you can see and feel how hard they tried. Let me explain. They wanted to have the feel of the original but still make it feel like 2024, after all, there's a big different between the times lf the original and the musical. The musical part was fun...sometimes. Some of these actors/actresses just weren't good at singing. I adored Karen's ditzy side in the original but I just couldn't like her character in this one. Same with Regina, she was the ultimate mean girl in the original. In this remake I felt like she just couldn't reach that level. The look and feel of the whole movie is a little off. Just don't go in with high hopes and you'll have a fun time! I think I made a mistake by comparing every scene to the original but I love the original and I was just so excited for this version! 6 stars for making me feel nostalgic but -1 star for making me leave the theater disappointed."
tt11762114,5.0,It was fun but not a good movie. The music is really meant for live action and the movie kinda just looks like a bunch of music videos. The original is way better and has better pacing than this version. Plus 80% of the actors are not fit for the roles they got. It's also missing the best part which is the original Christmas show dance. Some of the meta jokes were fun but they didn't space them out enough. The mean girls were not mean enough and it seems they were very afraid of offending which I get but this feels like they put safety guards on bullying. Also the lesson is punched so in face you can't not understand it and made me feel like they thought I am stupid.

Overall, a mediocre retelling of an iconic movie as it feels like a musically modern imitation rather than a remake, and it does not help that the musical numbers are not that well executed.Pretty Bad Direction (The direction macroscale was kinda poor because the musical numbers were not the best choreographed and the world wasn't built well; the direction on a microscale felt like an imitation of the original 'Mean Girls' movie but with a modern twist; the direction of actors was decent as most of the performances stayed true to the course (though just not as good as the original); the storytelling was decent as they used the audience's knowledge of the previous story and coupled with musical numbers to move to plot forward (which ultimately replaces the narration and straightforward style of the original)), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Angourie Rice (Holds her own and shows some promise as a singer (but does not have the same charm as Lindsay Lohan)), Pretty Good from Reneé Rapp (Embodies the character well and has a good singing voice (but just does not stand out as Rachel McAdams iconic performance)), Good from Auli'i Cravalho (Mostly on par with Lizzy Caplan's performance and has the best vocal performance in the entire cast), Decent from Christopher Briney (Not as good as the original character but holds his own well), Pretty Good to Good from Tina Fey (Continues to pretty much play herself and other characters she's played), Pretty Good to Good from Tim Meadows (Feels like he is doing an impersonation of his previous performance (though he still is memorable in his own right)), Good from Jaquel Spivey (The only performance that was truly better than the original as he has a great sense of comedic timing and a good vocal performance (when he's given the chance)), Pretty Bad from Jenna Fischer (Just feels off and not in time with Angourie Rice), Decent from the rest of the cast (While the performances are not as good as the original, everyone holds their own as there is no real sour performance that stands out)), Decent to Pretty Good Story (The story is basically a musically modern retelling of 'Mean Girls' as there are no deviations from the original plot; the plot structure was actually better as they cut out some of the unnecessary exposition and put more emphasis on the climax; flow between sequences was decent; the character writing was the same as the original (providing nothing new)), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue was basically a modern version of the original (with them putting more emphasis on the iconic lines); the humor was decently on par with the original (but there is less charm because it reuses a lot of the same jokes), the movie has the best joke if you combine both of the movies; the symbolism is pretty shallow and the message is pretty predictable (the movie is pretty simple in itself, so it really shouldn't be taken that seriously); the foreshadowing is nonexistent because the songs make reference to key points from the end (with the overall movie being just fan service)), Decent Score/Pretty Bad Soundtrack (A lot of the songs were just stupid and tried to force in references from the original movie, though there are some songs I did like), Bad Cinematography (Incredibly nauseating and just felt very cheap (seen in the musical numbers) and amateurish (especially when they would cut between full and widescreen)), Pretty Bad Sound (Felt kinda cheap and felt similar to how other musicals mix in sound), Bad Editing (Tacky and cheap as it tries to emulate the 2020s social media era), Decent Production Design (Tried to emulate the original movie), Pacing was a good pace for the whole movie (this time they fixed the pacing issues towards the end), Climax was executed better this time around as they had more time to play with and had a good build-up (felt more balanced overall and ended where it should), Tone is very different from the original (and this is mostly seen with them replacing the narration with musical numbers), The marketing for this movie was a big issue because they made Regina act like the main character and barely included Cady (even though Cady still is the protagonist)"
tt26047818,5.0,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
tt26047818,5.0,"This movie is exactly what I thought it would be so I can't complain too much.The two leads are both very attractive and have good chemistry, so that was entertaining to watch and nice on the eyes. It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."
tt26047818,6.0,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
tt26047818,5.0,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."
tt15314262,5.0,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
tt15314262,5.0,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
tt14371878,6.0,"""LIFT,"" a new heist movie from 2024, delivers a light-hearted and straightforward robbery story reminiscent of classics like ""The Italian Job"" and ""Ocean's Eleven,"" albeit without the same level of charisma.This film is a fun, one-time watch with a joyfully unrealistic approach and a clear happy ending. The acting in ""LIFT"" is simple and fitting for the genre. The villain's role, while episodic, lacks complex scripting or depth. The plot is quite straightforward, lacking the intricacies and captivating scenes that often define heist movies.The film is good for a casual evening watch but doesn't have the rewatchability factor. The actors perform pleasantly, and while it incorporates comedy, the number of jokes is limited, and they're sprinkled throughout a basic script. The simplicity of the storyline means it's devoid of cunning twists or complexity.The ending of ""LIFT"" is satisfying, bringing a sense of justice as those who were wronged find a way to get back at their deceivers. Everyone ends up together, creating a feel-good conclusion to the story. In summary, ""LIFT"" is a decent heist movie that's enjoyable for a one-time watch but lacks the elements that would make it a genre standout. It's a simple, easy-to-digest film suitable for a light-hearted movie night."

Otherwise, its an enjoyable movie to kill time.I wish there is will not be any sequel to increase my isery even more. Now I lost word to make any more comments because movie so painful to describe how i felt. I wish its not the worst movie i ever seen."
tt1517268,6.0,"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman."
tt1517268,6.0,"Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is The Wizard of Oz (1939) journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of The Truman Show (1998) or Stranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth."
tt1517268,6.0,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings."
tt1517268,6.0,"As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are ""brainwashed"" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia."
tt1517268,6.0,"I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see."
tt1517268,6.0,"Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out."
tt1517268,5.0,"My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction."
tt1517268,6.0,"I watched this with my wife who was ready to turn it off after about ten minutes, but I talked her into watching it - ""It'll get better, honey. They'll be going into the real world, soon.""Well, it didn't get better, after they went into the real world. I feel like it was a better show in Barbieland where it seemed more realistic.There isn't anything wrong with the acting or production, but the script is weak, particularly when they get to the real world. People just don't act like that. I'm disappointed for the actors, I think they thought it would be a great movie, however it's much more of a letdown."

At least Gosling plays his part well, but the story is abysmal. If you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry, then yes please do. You will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow ..... nearly two hours long this was mind-numbing storytelling at its mediocre worst. How many ways can I say do not go see it if you have a choice. See anything else but this exercise in horrendous cliches and exaggerated self-importance. If I could give it negative 10 stars I would."
tt1517268,6.0,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?"
tt1517268,6.0,"This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!"
tt1517268,6.0,"Mrs. Shullivan and I enjoyed about the first 30 minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various Ken's we agreed that Ryan Gosling appeared to be the main character and not Barbie.Don't get me wrong, both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of Ken and Barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the Ryan Gosling ""Ken doll"" with an enhanced CGI eight (8) pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for Ryan Gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through Barbie's vision of the changing world.The visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the 1960's Elvis films such as Blue Hawaii since Barbie and Elvis were popular icons within the same era. The downside of the Barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male Ken dolls.All in all it was a decent film, not to be considered a future film classic, nor a memorable Ryan Goslng or Margot Robbie performance worthy of an Academy Award but just like Barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era. It would not surprise me to see a TV producer turn this Barbie film into a franchise merchandise bonanza and a weekly 30 minute TV sitcom which in my humble opinion is about all it could hold Mrs. Shullivan and my own attention for.I give the film a decent 6 out of 10 IMDb rating."
tt1517268,5.0,"I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie."
tt1517268,5.0,"I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes of the movie. It was very upbeat, positive and light. However, things soon became negative about 20 - 25 minutes into the movie. I couldn't stand it. Barbie's world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken's attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.I bought tickets to this show a month ago. And, I saw it the day before the official opening day. I was very excited about this movie. And, I was playing the music (Dua Lipa) song almost every day. I was really excited for this movie - and was looking forward to something very positive. But, the vast majority of the movie was the ""conflict"" part of the writing. It was just too much! The movie didn't need to go that way, that far, that fast. I would have preferred a more shallow and fun Barbie movie vs. This Barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict."
tt9663764,5.0,"So many aspects of this movie are a complete mixed bag:1) Half of the comedy is really funny, the other half made me roll my eyes.2) Some of the one-liners are good, some made me cringe.3) A lot of the action is so cool, a lot is a screen full of gibberish.4) There are so many beautiful shots and visuals, and also horribly cartoonish CGI like in The Flash.5) I enjoyed the musical score, but it doesn't reach the level of Black Adam's. And I wasn't a fan of using classic rock tracks for a lighter tone, something we're more likely to see in a Marvel movie.6) Half the time I was invested, the other half I was unengaged and didn't care.I had an okay time wit this movie. It benefits from IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio for the entire movie. But in the biggest IMAX around, there were a total of 8 people in my theater. DC seems to have alienated its die-hard fans.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 12/21/2023)"
tt9663764,6.0,"IF this was made in the early days of superhero franchises, say when Iron Man first came out, then it might have stood out. Unfortunately Aquaman 2 has to bear the burden of having to follow through the recent flops and/or mixed bag of superhero output from both MCU/DCEU.James Wan doesn't offer anything new under sky; a baddie who wants revenge - saw that in the Marvels. Sibling tension? Saw that in Thor. Supposedly all powerful, final-baddie who then gets thumped easily? Saw that in Black Adam. By now, there's such an air of familiarity in superhero fares, that I think it' gonna take a complete shift in narrative/plots to offer audiences a fresh take.Jason Momoa's charisma and screen presence is basically the backbone of the movie and it pretty much carries it through. His timing, especially humour, is spot on, while his Aquaman is also convincingly authoritative. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's somewhat wasted here. A capable actor, but he's reduced to portraying a stock baddie out for revenge, while his right arm, Stingray, is as one dimensional as they come. Plus it doesn't help that the actress who plays Stingray is kinda cardboard too.I find Randall Park, while dependable, nevertheless still plays Randall Park from other movies/Tv shows. You've seen his character in Blockbuster, or in the mcu outfits.Don't have any complaints on Amber Heard or Nicole Kidman, but they don't have enough screen time to make much of an impact. But I have to admit, I did wonder, what if Nicole played Capt. Marvel instead of Brie? I think I would have bought into it a lot faster. Kidman's talent is such that, even small screen time doesn't stop her from exuding enough screen presence to make her contribution count.Which leaves me with Patrick Wilson. His portrayal of Orm is brilliant, suffusing the character with the tension his inner conflicts have with his motives - ""do I live in hate, or do I forgive?"" The fact that Wilson achieves this without any acting histrionics but leaves his angst just right above the surface, just enough for us to feel it, is probably the standout feature of Aquaman and Lost Kingdom. I think he kinda redeemed himself from the poor and dumb Moonfall.I hope James Gunn will be able to create not only a new trajectory for DCEU, but an entire different take on superhero movies. While Aquaman 2 is entertaining enough to fill your 2h, it's also a by the numbers' effort. Not something you and I will live to remember."
tt9663764,6.0,"After everything i herd, i thought this was going to be horrible, but it was not. It really was not.My favorite part of the movie was the relationship between the two brothers Aquaman and the Ocean Master. Watching these two act like brothers in the movie was absolutely entertaining. It just worked so well.Aquaman 2 seemed to be about two brothers who don't know each other really well going on an Adventure to get to know each other and that worked.This movie seemed to be all about family and that helped with the personality of the blockbuster. Even Amber Heard which I was surprise how much of her actually made it to the final flick.Black Manta steps up as a great villain. His vengeance was well laid out.I will say the movie tried to be Epic without any substance. They tried to make everything look really big but it all felt empty.Plus the speical effects were distracting. The underwater effect seemed so lame in this film.Other than that, its as good of a watch as the first one. Glad i went to see it."
tt9663764,6.0,"Going to this film, I expected little to nothing after hearing how awful people thought it was. To my surprise, it wasn't that bad and I actually enjoyed this film. It wasn't without its problems, but I was pretty satisfied with it being what it was.The cons of this film are mainly dialogue and CGI. There are all of these cheesy lines that you would expect to hear and one line jokes at the end of a scene, almost like you are watching a sitcom series. Jason Mamoa as an actor has charisma and knows how to steal the show. But unlike the first Aquaman, here it feels as if he's just playing himself. There is no real depth to Arthur's (Jason Mamoa) arc, by the end he is still this punk cool guy which is fine but really nothing else.Here you have two villains. Black manta who was alright but ultimately fell short and then this monstrosity named Kordax who honestly looks like a power ranger villain, it's rough. The problem here for me is that this could've been an exciting hunt movie where Black Manta is just wreaking havoc on Arthurs life, without all of the supposed fleshing out of this universe.CGI here was just bad. Didn't look real or feel real. What's funny is that if you go back ten years or so, where the technology wasn't near what it is today, you have all these high- budget blockbuster films that are just beautiful. What happened?Now for what I did like. The biggest pro in my opinion is the Arthur and Orm dynamic. They have this wonderful chemistry and it turned out to have a heartwarming send off to Orm's character. I think Patrick Wilson is great as Orm. His character had a redemption arc which I just loved.The action here was also fun. There is a scene between Arthur and Black Manta where they are fighting with their tridents which was intense. Another sequence I had a really great time with was when Arthur breaks Orm out of prison. Quite a few jokes landed for me too.This film is a mess and yet has its moments. I finished the film thinking to myself ""Wow, don't judge a book by its cover"". Give this a shot, you might also enjoy this enough. It sums up to a brotherly fun adventure movie, without taking it too seriously."
tt9663764,5.0,"Amongst the fall of superhero movies, Aquaman 2 stands out as a completely average movie that actually doesn't stand out at all. The genre is really on its last legs at this point. Drained completely dry. It is a shame as the movie does have its qualities. The action and vfx are pretty on point, while very jarring, I think it fits the already ridiculous setting and plot.Aquaman 2 knows exactly what it is, but it doesn't try to do anything to improve upon the first film. The writers especially didn't improve anything. Multiple times I was scratching my head at stupid inconsistencies within the script. In summary, the film has its ups and downs, there is fun too be had somewhere...5/10."
tt9663764,5.0,"I was a bit confused about Atlantis being somehow still hidden. I just thought everybody knew about with Aquaman fighting for the Justice League, which BTW is nearly non-existent in this feature except for a Ben Affleck cameo. Let's just pretend DC Comics decided to have its own ""reset.""With the help of a scientist (Randall Park) and global warming David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) discovers the existence of another Atlantis, or at least the broken black trident of the Lost Kingdom of Necros. Holding the two pieces together Kane is given knowledge to uncover the lost technology that Atlantis had abandoned because it was destroying their world by altering the climate. (See where this is going.) Aquaman (Jason Momoa) must resque his brother (Patrick Wilson) from the Harry Potter prison of Azkaban. They then must see a pirate who looks like Jabba the Hut. The nobody hits my brother line reminded me of Beverly Hill Ninja. I am not sure why they played ""Spirit in the Sky"" for underwater scenes as if I wasn't confused enough. Aquaman does have a son in his feature who can talk to fishes. I was disappointed it never came into play.Good action. Horrible script. Waste of money."
tt15009428,6.0,"There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining."
tt15009428,5.0,"It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it."
tt15009428,5.0,"Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me."
tt15009428,5.0,"Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)"
tt15009428,6.0,"This film would have been a hit if released in the 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, for the current audience, it falls short of expectations, especially for those anticipating a show akin to Kingsman.Positive:
Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie."
tt8051894,6.0,"Based on a true story, it seemed cloyingly maudlin. Whereas a story like Rudy plays out naturally, elements of this seem theatrically pushed into repetitive stark stereotypical juxtapositions. It was longer than it needed to be, and even my wife said the same thing though she enjoyed it more.The acting, however, is what makes this so compelling. The man playing Rickey Hill as an adult is a man we should expect to see much more. Dennis Quaid seemingly turns every scene -and movie-into powerful performances. One reviewer said the background actors were poor but I sure didn't think so. Everyone turned in great, believable, deep performances, which is why I did not rate it lower.Settings for the scenes are well done. Look for real major league pitcher John Smoltz as the final game announcer.Summary: many people will like it for its spirit of facing trials and tribulations, and can be expected to rate it higher, but it just seems overly heavy handed and long attempting to manipulate emotions."
tt8051894,6.0,"The Netflix pre-trailer portrays a very different story than the one you are given. It certainly is not the traditional sports film. That is not to say all of the movie is bad, there are in fact some scenes that are high quality and will move your heart. The issue is that there is too much filler that doesn't quite develop the characters enough. Some of the scenes between the child and his father just don't quite deliver the impact needed , the scenes are too raw and I'm not sure whether it was the acting or the script but I definitely needed more. I believe it would have made the story more powerful if more attention was given to digging deeper into the boys relationship with his father outside of just the fact that his dad wanted him to be a clergyman instead of a baseball player . There was a point for me where I just wanted more meaningful heartfelt dialogue between them which would have made the ending so much more rewarding in my opinion. It could have better established the father in particulars growth as a character.Still ithe movie was a worthwhile watch . Had the potential to be spectacular , but lacked in too many ways making it just ok."
tt8051894,6.0,"The trailer showed us a corny Christian themed baseball movies and that's what we got. The story is uplifting, and the movie proves we can have family friendly films. I definitely thought they could have cut it down by 20 minutes, but I still enjoyed it.I don't think you have to be a Christian to like the movie since they don't demand any beliefs from the audience. It is probably aimed at that crowd though. If you love baseball, ever had to overcome something, or can just feel inspired by Rickey's story then this film is for you.It's great for the entire family.It's definitely a very white film. I say this as a white person. I don't think the black characters were portrayed in a bad light, but they were only there to support the white characters. All two of them with lines. This is based on a true story in Texas from the 60's and 70's though, so it might have been this way.It was also good to see them capture the time and family well, without putting full on child abuse on the screen. We were told enough."
tt8051894,5.0,"They advertise this as a baseball film with a religious backdrop but it's the exact opposite. The family and their religion is the main focus of this movie and the sons baseball career is just the backdrop to what is a religious film. I have no problems with films about religion but when something is sold as one thing and it turns out to be another I get annoyed by that. There is no reason why you should have to fool your audiences into thinking your movie is something that it's not. If your film has a good story then you don't need to dress it up as something else and trick people into watching it under false pretence. This movie is watchable for what it is, however it is very formulaic and your standard religion based film."
tt8051894,5.0,"The story inspires, but the movie itself touches my heart very little, I like films based on the real fates of people, and I would really like to see a real movie that will cause empathy and joy for the hero, but alas, this film could not give me these feelings, it's a pity. Moments of struggle and overcoming are good in the picture, but there are few of them, and they are created with weak dramatic force. The film is based on the main conflict between father and son, but this conflict is loosely connected: the father's storyline does not allow me to fully sympathize with him - it is difficult for me to understand him, it is difficult for me to understand his contradictory motives: How does playing baseball contradict ""God's providence""? So I don't get it either. The director's work could not attract my attention - it's a pity."
tt8051894,5.0,"This story very inspiring and interesting - but the execution was just bad .This movie was way way too long , extremely repetitive and the acting felt like a middle school play . The Christian background was important and hill was a man of faith which is powerful - but it was never shown - they only told it to you . Over and over and over .It's pretty much exactly what you think you will get going into it and nothing more . A sports story with some scripture in a clean and family friendly movie that does little more than make you want to look up the Wikipedia article on the main character .It's clean , it's a Christian sports movie and it is boring and low quality - if you know that going in - go for it ."
tt3758542,6.0,"For a film helmed by Michael Mann and starring Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz, I was expecting a lot more from this.By the end, I didn't feel like I was much closer to Enzo Ferrari or his wife. I didn't come away with much more of an understanding or appreciation of the racing element. I didn't feel overly thrilled or engaged.This all sounds a bit negative, but that's not to say there aren't positives to this film. Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz are really strong, even if they don't peel back the layers of the characters enough for me. However this is more of a criticism of the script than the performances. The racing scenes are well executed although could be a little more exciting and perhaps even shot a little better. Speaking of the direction, it is fine but I think there was potential to really get creative and design some thrilling set pieces. It probably didn't help that the pacing of this film was totally off, feeling much longer than it actually is, which reduced the impact of some of these scenes.Overall I think this is a film of what could have been. There's an interesting story and an interesting man at the heart of all of this, but it just wasn't teased out enough."
tt3758542,5.0,"Ferrari ends up being such a slog of a movie in place of what should've been a thrilling an interesting portrait of a complex figure. The performances might be solid and there's an effective moment here or there but the word that comes to mind when describing the film as a whole is flat. This filmmaker and cast telling a story with this interesting a subject matter should've amounted to a lot more than it ultimately did. For as exhilarating as motor racing is supposed to be I have to say I found the film to be overwhelmingly dull when all was said and done.The whole aesthetic is totally without life which is the last thing I would've expected for a director of Michael Mann's calibre. Mann takes a very documentarian approach to the directing and it just robs the film of any energy or sense of direction. From almost the opening minutes there a serious lack of momentum. The scenes play out in very beat for beat type way with no sense of flair and as impressive as the racing sequences are they're too few and far between to save this movie from the drag that it ends up being. All the scenes away from the track are framed in the most shot/reverse shot manner imaginable so almost none of the dramatic moments had any sort of impact on me. There's an extremely effective moment in the 3rd act that felt like Mann was finally adding some stakes to the whole thing by then it was too little too late for me.The script here is painfully unremarkable and it rears its head in how it portrays its main character. Adam Driver is solid in the role as Enzo Ferrari, though I wouldn't rate it as one of his best performances, but I never really found the depiction of the character to be that compelling. It's established early on that Ferrari puts up a wall around everyone but as an audience member it put me at a distance from his character. I didn't think there were enough moments where his guard went down and we see what really drives him so as a result I just found him to be a bit of a rich egomaniac with motivations I didn't find to be that interesting. There's a love triangle that's set up with Penelope Cruz and Shailene Woodley's characters that almost felt like it should've been the scripts main focus but after a while it just fades into the background for the central race to take up more screen time. Driver and Cruz have good chemistry but I never really thought that Mann got to the heart of their relationship and the exposition that's given on this three way dynamic feels like it comes in the complete wrong order. I was just waiting for characters to find out information I already knew and it just kills the pacing and any impact that these reveals could've had.I never would've guessed that Ferrari was a long time passion project for Michael Mann because nothing in the final product gives any sense of a vision for this story. It's totally unimpressive on a script and technical level and the few effective moments and impressive race sequences aren't enough to save the total bore that Ferrari ended up being as a whole."
tt3758542,5.0,"Definitely NOT a car movie and definitely NOT a gripping dramatic portrayal either. It's not a flop alright, but it is an awkward misfire for sure.The bad: Director Michael Mann is famous for several terrific action thrillers in the past (HEAT), but he has never excelled at making a true drama (on the contrary) and this is the exact problem with this movie, because it is severely LACKING in true drama.It's lackluster, uneventful and simply going through the motions. Almost the entire storyline is about money problems for producing racecars and lots of wife / lover quarrels / issues. What's suppose to be exciting about that?!Not even the car races (the few that were featured) were thrilling to watch. Those races didnt look bad for sure, but they werent exhilirating either. Quite average to be honest. Was this a car movie? NOPE it was NOT.What is it then? This story is entirely focussed on the CHARACTER of Mister Ferrari, played by Adam Driver. I really value this actor's performance in many other great movies, he's definitely a great actor, but he didnt nail it this time. And I am being really polite now...BEWARE: use subtitles because director Michael Mann decided to let all the ITALIAN characters speak in almost unrecognizable English with a terrible accent. THAT was THE most annoying thing, that really PUT ME OFF entirely. What jibberish accents.Not a total flop, but an awkward misfire of a drama for sure..."
tt3758542,6.0,"In the surface, Ferrari appears to be a well-directed, well-acted and adrenaline fuelled with excellent racing sequences. And yet, throughout the film, I couldn't help but feel disinterested and dissatisfied. This film has all the elements to be a slam dunk and yet I never felt attached to Enzo Ferrari and his struggles.The performances are decent overall. Unfortunately, I was most disappointed by Adam Driver as the titular character. He never showcases the great range that I know he is capable with. His Enzo Ferrari is very reserved and somewhat bland. It's not helped that he is speaking English while attempting an Italian accent. If Chernobyl (2019) can get away with all English dialogue, then I feel you can do that here. It would certainly allow Driver to reach greater levels of acting. The saviour of this film is certainly Penélope Cruz. She delivers an excellent performance as Laura and I wish she got more screen time.But if you're here for the racing, the film does delivers. It's few and far between, but the third act is a long, intense race with great sound design and editing. It's a shame that you're not invested in any of the racers since the film doesn't characterise any of them. It means the climax of the film doesn't hit as hard as it probably should. It's certainly shocking and brutal but it's hard to stay immersed when the violence is so over the top and the CGI is not quite great.Overall, Ferrari feels like a film that could've been better. The characters could've been better, the story could've covered a more interesting part of Enzo Ferrari's life and the acting could've been more. I left this film not feeling like I did not know Enzo Ferrari. It's a film that perhaps is not for me, but I can see how others enjoy it."
tt3758542,5.0,"There are a couple films that come to mind when trying to judge how good Ferrari was. The first is ""Napoleon"". It is another biography that came out around the same time as this film. Each film needs the main character to capture the audience's interest. For both films, the dysfunctional marital relationship was a major narrative. Because of Joaquin Phoenix's legacy of gripping roles (""Joker""), he successfully embodied the main character. The film suffered for other reasons, but it kept my interest. ""Ferrari"" cast Adam Driver as the main character. I first saw Driver in ""Midnight Special"" as a quirky and interesting scientist. I really like Driver, and thought he was a good fit as the bad guy in the new Star Wars movies. However, I think someone else would have been a better fit as Ferrari. Driver doesn't exude power and leadership like the role needed. Someone who is bit older and more fits the physique. If this was made 10 years ago, someone like Christian Bale would've been a good fit.The other film I can't help but compare ""Ferrari"" to is ""Ford vs. Ferrari"". Although it came out four years prior to this film, it is recent enough to gauge what is a better film about racing. ""Ferrari"" never pretended to be about racing, it is a biography of the man. Meanwhile ""Ford vs Ferrari"" is about racing. The movie centered more on the cars than the people. In ""Ferrari"", care is taken to give many of the supporting characters some depth. The downside is that the majority of the film focuses more on the people than the machines. For that reason, I preferred ""Ford vs Ferrari"". In truth that film features very little of Ferrari other than being the rival for Ford.On the flipside, the driving scenes in the ""Ferrari"" are very dynamic without being gimmicky, and are a feast of sight and sound. The cinematography does a good job showing us vintage Italy. The dialogue could be cringe-worthy if one cared to scrutinize the Italian accents. In general, when rating this Micheal Mann film, I thought of ""Public Enemies"". That film follows John Dillinger, but has a different tone than this. Sadly, the tone here is very mild for ""Ferrari"", and the whole is not greater than the sum of the parts. This is mostly evident in the climax, in which no swelling of emotion takes place, at least not as intended. I give it a 5 out of 10."
tt3758542,5.0,"Have only seen this advertised a couple of times but was sort of intrigued as to what sort of film it would be. The trailers didn't exactly sell it to me & didn't exactly excite me in any way. But as I said, I was intrigued & of course was able to see this ahead of the UK Boxing Day release via a Limitless Membership.Set in the summer of 1957, with Enzo Ferrari's auto empire in crisis, the ex-racer turned entrepreneur pushes himself & his drivers to the edge as they launch into the Mille Miglia, a treacherous 1,000-mile race across Italy.I found the film to be quite mundane for the most part. The story & sub plots were confusing & the film was hard to follow. The racing & crashes were good, & with a bit of eye candy, it just about got you through the overly long 2 hours & 7 minute runtime.The casting is not bad, but could've been better & like the film, could've used some meaty impact. The film looks & feels tired as it plods along & of course, you find yourself not caring & your mind wandering. The pacing is also off in this flick too.I was more expecting the film to be about the orgins of Enzo's life, like how he worked his way up sort of thing & most importantly, to be easier to follow & be more concise in its story-telling, which this film failed on all forms.Overall, don't expect much from this flick. The film really is as mundane as the trailer is & if that doesn't make you think twice, I don't know what will. This film is ok, but could've been better, much, much better.5/10."
tt3758542,5.0,"I had a considerable number of issues with this film, the primary one was the fact that they spent way too much time dwelling on the relationship between the Enzo and his wife, in addition to the relationship between Enzo and his mistress (played by a tragically miscast Shaileen Woodley) neither of which were particularly interesting, as relationships, as characters, or as stories.We went into this film assuming it was going to be a movie about the evolution of Ferrari as a car, as a company, and as a legend, and it ended up being more or less a melodrama about failed relationships. Michael Mann, who is quite an accomplished director, failed on his part to not discern the fact that audiences wanted to see more about the company, and more about the car, and less about these relationships, which I don't think we're all that interesting.Enzo's first wife, played by the talented Penelope Cruz certainly had reason to be miserable, but her character just possessed this black cloud everywhere she went, and every scene that she was in was difficult to watch.This was the most boring racing film I've ever seen in my life and I just can't recommend it. It had an incredibly somber tone to it that just didn't work. Very little about this film worked and I was very very happy when it was finally over."
tt3758542,5.0,"Watched this and thought to myself wonder what budget was used, after finding out it cost 96 million I have to question where all the money went. The storyline drags and is very boring, some of the car scenes look terrible and most of the acting is very average.It is very weird to make a movie about Enzo and only include a tiny piece of his life, there was a lot more to this man than one race and a love child. So much more in his life that would have made sense to make a movie about.I really question sometimes movie studios and who makes the decisions on what to spend money on. In particular the car accident scenes are woeful, $96 mil and this is what they came up with? Pretty sure if you gave me that much I could make a better movie."
tt3758542,5.0,"This was a major letdown. Michael Mann is a great director and a prospect of a new movie from him had me excited. The biggest dissapointment of all was the look of the film. It looks so boring and has no visual flair at all. I would blame it on it being shot on digital but that can't be it when Mann made both Collateral and Miami Vice, which looked great and were both shot on digital. On top of that, it's really dull and uninspired. Scenes have no energy to them and many characters are constantly introduced without explaining who they are. Even when their presence is explained the majority of them are simply uninterestingly portrayed. Moreover, the accents are awful. I'd much rather actors do no accents. Either way Italians wouldn't speak English so just skip it altogether because otherwise characters sound like caricatures and scenes become laughable.Additionally, there are also some sub-par visual effects. On the other hand, the cars do sound and look great but the racing sequences aren't too exciting. They should be but the pace of the movie nullifies their excitement. It's hard to be invested when you are bored and when you don't care about any of the characters. Compare this to Ford v Ferrari or Rush and it's not even a competition. Those movies made the viewers become very invested in the spectactle. I can't believe I will say this but I wish a different director made Ferrari. Clearly Michael Mann is past it and someone else could've added more energy and pizzazz to the whole thing. I can't believe this is the passion project of a once great director thay we had to wait so many years for."
tt3758542,6.0,"Michael Mann is an interesting filmmaker as Mann is great at capturing crime, thrillers, and drama stories with strong atmospheres, direction, dialogue, and action. While not every movie he has made was great, I expect Mann to provide some strong directing and interesting action and thrill moments. I didn't love Ferrari as I would have wanted to but I still found it to be interesting.Throughout, the camerawork and the production design is pretty good as the production and setting helps to capture the time period and environment. Many of the wide shots, the car moments, or scenes where tension, action, and racing occurs are well-executed as Mann never disappoints on crafting action and thrill scenes. Most of the performances are solid. Adam Driver as Enzo Ferrari was pretty good but Penélope Cruz provided the best performances as she had great emotions, personality and chemistry with her role. Including a good soundtrack.The narrative explores more on the personal and professional struggles of Enzo Ferrari alongside with others around which is more slow-burn then action. The narrative is interesting as I enjoyed the concepts and themes the story explores. But at the same time I wished certain concepts could have been explored or handled differently. The characters, while slightly dull at times, were interesting in exploring the personal dynamics and personalities of each one's own. Some have criticized Driver's accent for being pretty bad but I personally didn't mind it since it wasn't on the level of House of Gucci awful.The dialogue is pretty good but there were some clunky dialogue moments. Throughout, the movie had a good atmosphere, color presentation and sound design. There are some pretty bad uses of CGI effects. Despite some of the gripes, I was still invested to see where the movie was heading.Overall, it's not Michael Mann's best movie but it was nice to see Michael Mann doing another project after his previous work in 2015."
tt3758542,5.0,"When I saw the trailer for this film, I expected it to be a biopic that might garner nominations during the upcoming Awards Season, and even if it didn't it looked like something worthwhile, directed by Michael Mann (The Last of the Mohicans, Heat, Collateral, Public Enemies). Basically, in the summer of 1957, Italian entrepreneur Enzo Ferrari (Adam Driver) is preparing his racing team for the open road, endurance-based race Mille Miglia which lasts for one thousand miles. He is contending with professional problems, as well as personal problems with his estranged wife, Laura (Penélope Cruz). Ferrari and Laura are grieving the loss of their son Dino (Benedetto Benedettini) who died a year ago from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. But also, Ferrari has had numerous infidelities which he has kept from Laura. Ferrari's mistress, Lina Lardi (Shailene Woodley), is pressuring him to grant their illegitimate son, Piero (Giuseppe Festinese), the Ferrari name. Meanwhile, Ferrari's manufacturing company is suffering from severe financial loss, in the wake of the ground-breaking development of the Formula One car. Ferrari has no choice but to merge with a sister company to continue doing business. However, Laura owns half of Ferrari's shares, and to move forward with deals he must convince Laura to sign the entirety of the company over to him. Laura is resentful and demands a cheque $500,000, which will bankrupt the company if she gets it. Laura confirms her suspicions that Enzo has been having an affair after finding the countryside house outside Modena where Lina and Piero live. Enzo agrees to write the cheque and trusts her to wait. As the Mille Miglia commences in Brescia, Ferrari encourages his drivers to remain ahead of the competition. In Rome, during a pit stop, Alfonso de Portago (Gabriel Leone), the latest recruit to the team, refuses to change his tyres to stay in the lead. Later, driving over a damaged road stud causes a tyre blowout, Alfonso loses control of the vehicle, veers off the road, runs over nine onlookers who are killed, and Alfonso dies being cut in half. Another of Ferrari's drivers, veteran Piero Taruffi (Patrick Dempsey), completes the round trip to Brescia, crosses the finish line and wins the race. The media blames Ferrari for de Portago's lethal accident, and Laura cashes her cheque to bribe the journalists. She signs over the full rights to the company, requesting that in return, Enzo refrain from giving Piero the Ferrari name until after she is dead. Enzo agrees and later brings Piero to his half-brother's grave. Also starring Sarah Gadon as Linda Christian, Jack O'Connell as Peter Collins, Michele Savoia as Carlo Chiti, Lino Musella as Sergio Scaglietti, Domenico Fortunato as Adolfo Orsi, Jacopo Bruno as Omer Orsi, Erik Haugen as Edmund ""Gunner"" Nelson, Ben Collins (formerly The Stig in Top Gear) as Stirling Moss, Wyatt Carnel as Wolfgang Graf Berghe von Trips, Tommaso Basili as Gianni Agnelli, Marino Franchitti as Eugenio Castellotti, and Jonathan Burteaux as King Hussein of Jordan. Driver (very aptly named lol) gives a good performance with only a faint attempt at an Italian accent, while Cruz is good as the feisty wife who takes no prisoners. Unfortunately, I disagree with the amount of praise this film has received, I think it is overrated by critics, I was personally rather disappointed, and I know it didn't perform well at the box office. I found the majority of it dull and boring, the only good bits are the fairly exciting speedy racing sequences, the memorably brutal and shocking crash sequence, and some bickering between Driver and Cruz, it's just an alright biographical sports drama. Worth watching, at least once, in my opinion!"
tt3758542,6.0,"With Ferrari on the brink of bankruptcy, Enzo Ferrari has a plan to reignite The Company's fortunes.The trailers definitely made me want to watch this film, and whilst I quite enjoyed it, I really wanted it to be so much better than it was.At times, I found it quite slow, some of the scenes could have easily been edited down, there's atmosphere, and then there's drawn out, it's clunky in parts, the story takes a while to come to life.The racing sequences however are terrific, they look so authentic, that crash scene, amazing.Gorgeous visuals, it very much put me in mind of House of Gucci, stylish, well filmed, and jaw dropping style. If you love classic and vintage cars, there's a whole lot to enjoy here.Modena looks divine, and if you're able to, please visit, it is an exquisite place.Adam Driver does a good job, as does Penelope Cruz, credit to the makeup artists, they made Driver look way older than 40.It's good, deserved to be excellent.6/10."
tt11858890,5.0,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
tt11858890,5.0,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
tt11858890,5.0,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
tt11858890,5.0,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
tt11858890,6.0,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
tt11858890,6.0,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."

There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
tt11858890,5.0,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."

Bernstein is the guy that got me hooked on classical music and music in general, but I didn't learn anything about his musical career, his childhood, his years at Harvard, his work in Europe, who inspired him, etc.The making of West Side Story is really interesting (if you know the story) but nothing about it in this film and I mean ""nothing.; We get a tiny glimpse of Candide, but nothing about its composition or insight into the Maestro's process. We get zero insight into his Missa Brevis, perhaps on the highlights of his career.Bradley Cooper blew me away. I've seen Lenny up close many times and I've talked to him a few times. Cooper nailed it, and the scene at St John of the Divine is probably one of the greatest musical scenes ever captured on film. Cooper's conducting is simply amazing. He worked very very hard to capture the speech, mannerisms, and the Bernstein attitude and texture toward music. I cannot speak highly enough of Cooper's performance, but we get so little insight into the musician, and that was so disappointing.Carey Mulligan? Her performance is nothing less than spectacular, in fact all the acting is extraordinary, but it's not a story. The Bernstein children really have nothing to do in this film, and I have no idea why Lenny's sister was included as she has very little to say or do. Overall, a very perplexing film ... not sure what he was going for. In fact, I kept waiting for it to start. The emphasis was all on style, and believe me, it's beautiful to look at."
tt5535276,5.0,"Yes, good acting, great music but absolutely no story. At all. Apart from his bisexuality which dominated the script.Bradley Cooper was too greedy in writing, directing and starring. What did he write? Not much of a story. I'd like to have seen Lenny's childhood explicated, more meat on the bare bones offered here.Also, why so little on West Side Story - one brief extract and not the huge explosive hit it was at the time. The adulation which followed.The teasing bits of his Missa were beautiful and far too much of his Mahler, though lovely, had little bearing on the overall story.Brad's prosthetic nose was distracting in that it gave a nasal whiny tone to his dialogue. And he might have done better with another actor.Carey Mulligan, as always was amazing in her role but again, underplayed the distress she must have felt at his infidelity/. At one point he left her for a young (male) lover and only returned when she was diagnosed with cancer. (in her breast, from a broken heart? Who knows)The great man of music was not served well here, far too shallow a treatment of his genius.5/10."
tt5535276,6.0,"We don't know much about Leonard Bernstein. We didn't learn why he wanted to be a composer or how he got in the business. His relationship wasn't very clear either. He's bisexual, but that doesn't go anywhere. His wife isn't explained much either other than being a stage actress. We don't know much about his children. The timelines aren't clear when the movie takes place. It seems to start in the 50s other than the opening scene of him as an old man. I do like Bradley Cooper's performance, but not much comes from the character. We don't know what made him famous since he was already famous before his memorable score in On the Waterfront."
tt5535276,6.0,"A struggling musician agonized by his own genius, talents, and creativity and trapped in loveless marriage filled with guilt. Both look the other way while one has an affair and realize the importance of one's own partner too late. Right now, at the top of my head I can think of 'Fosse/Verdon', 'A Star Is Born', 'George & Tammy', 'Walk the Line', 'Dreamgirls', 'Daisy Jones & The Six', and etc. (Wow, that's a lot.) Biographical genre is especially tricky because it has to excel the life of actual historical figures. 'Maestro' could have been so much better if it delved into the introspective and artistic side of Bernstein deeper or provided a different and fresh point of view on his life rather than reciting his personal life. His autobiography or research would be more fun and interesting than this explanatory movie.There were a few futile attempts to make the movie look more artistic, abstract, and ambiguous. They failed because they serve no purpose but to look pretentious. White and black, camera movement, the use of light and shadows, and musical aspects. They are all good attempts, but for what? By doing so, is the story getting stronger? Do they enhance what viewers feel? Waste of time and films.Bradley Cooper's performance is disappointing. He never acts; he imitates. When he's on the screen, we know clearly that he's acting. It's hard to be absorbed and immersed into the screen because he always pushes the audience away with his trying too hard. I get that he wants to emulate Bernstein's twangy voice. However, emotions and messages he delivers are more important than his likeness of Bernstein's tone, accent, sound, or mannerism. He focuses on what's outside of Bernstein rather than what would be inside of him. There is a 10 minute sequence of Cooper conducting, and it's screaming 'Look how good I am!!!'. It's one of the highest points for emotions to burst out for the audience, and I started to laugh."
tt5535276,5.0,Bradley does a convincing facial transformation with make up and nose piece to look enough like Bernstein. Unfortunately every other aspect of the movie is lacking. First of all didn't like the direction. Strange camera angles. Unnecessary black and white cinematography. Also the mumbling dialogue and affected way the leads spoke. I know they were artists but no one talks like that. The main problem was the screenplay turned out like most biopics focussed on the wrong things. It does show him conducting but does not show him creating and glosses over his most famous work West Side Story. Instead the focus is on his marriage. Carey Mulligan is good at looking sad as usual. Sure she wasn't happy in the end he was having affairs with men but is this movie supposed to be about Leonard Bernstein's marriage? Not interesting aspect of his life. In this way it was even worse than the Cole Porter biopic with Kevin Kline. Too much about the relationship problems. In a biopic it's better to do it the old fashioned Hollywood way like in the 50s and 60s. Don't concentrate on the love life and focus on the man and his achievements and his legacy. But that's the problem with modern biopics. Too bad this could not have been an exception. Bradley should just have acted and not tried to direct and write the screenplay.
tt5535276,6.0,"The acting is superb and particularly Carey Mulligan who is astonishing, as usual, and Bradley Cooper's transformation is incredible. The look and feel throughout is very polished. But, and this isn't a minor quibble -- I found it really hard to understand the dialogue! Characters speak so quickly, in a mumble, that I actually considered putting on subtitles. Anyway, it wouldn't have made a difference, I thought the movie was so empty and plotless and uninteresting. There was really no tension in the wife's dealing with her husband's bisexuality, no real exploration or understanding of Bernstein's conflicts, and no delving into his achievements or their context, so there wasn't much left!"
tt5535276,5.0,"I had hoped to enjoy 'Maestro'. It is a film for adult audiences, featuring actors I appreciate (Bradley Cooper and Carey Mulligan) and directed by that same Bradley Cooper. It deals with a true American Icon (composer / conductor Leonard Bernstein) and deals with the 'man' inside that icon. In this time of Holiday Blockbusters it promised to appeal to an audience like me. And, in fact, it did. The theatre was two-thirds full; a first-time-since-the-Pandemic at this small art house.The film, however, is something of a mess. It is confused about the type of picture it wants to be. In its first thirty minutes it takes on a flight-of-fancy aura; it is as though Bernstein and his soon to be wife are in a musical-comedy with the background stage settings changing as if by magic. The film's first half is in black and white; I imagine a testament to The Forties and early Fifties (the time period covered by those scenes) but, in fact, lots of color-films were made at that time.Leonard Bernstein was bisexual. And that bisexuality is, in fact, revealed, but revealed in a coy, teasing, easy-to-misunderstand way. And then there is the background music, all of which was composed by Bernstein, but not all of which fits the scene it backgrounds. The selection from his 'West Side Story' is the most emblematic of this. But not the only example.For me, the story belongs to Bernstein's wife Felicia (played by Mulligan). She is the wife of a bisexual man; a fact that is problematic enough. But he is a man who is always center-stage, and for whom she gave up a promising career to raise their children, support her husband, and who suffers in silence until she can suffer silently no longer. But even here (and though Mulligan has long been a favorite of mine), there is a smile on her character that (a) rings insincere and (b) is repeated so often that I wanted to scream, No more. But, sadly, there is more; the most cinematic, most hard-to-believe smile coming, in a hard-to believe scene, in London's Westminster Cathedral.Finally there is the finale. I will give nothing away when I say that the film ends one scene too late, it is one scene too long. A scene in which Bernstein instructs a young orchestra conductor would be as appropriate an ending as one could hope for.But then ....."
tt5535276,6.0,"Even with its 4 strong nominations at the Golden Globes (Picture, Director, Actor, Actress), I must say my appreciation of Cooper's new film is not as stellar, as organic and fantastic as A Star Is Born (2018) - 8 Oscar noms.Netflix's firs real Oscar contender was Alfonso Cuarón's Roma (2018) which won 3 of its 10 nominations. Last year's Germany's remake of All Quiet on the Western Front (2022) was nominated for 9 Oscars and won 4. My all-time Netflix favorite is Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story which I rewatched recently. It is much better than that year's Best Picture co-nominee Martin Scorsese's The Irishman (2019) which was still as solid movie. Neither won and Netflix's overall 8 Best Picture nominees did not win since a decade at the Oscars.This year, Scorsese produces Maestro (2023) with Spielberg, but his own slow burn of a movie Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) has more flair yet not a Netflix production (he produces it with DiCaprio). I think this year's Netflix better picture is Todd Haynes's May December (2023 - also nominated for 4 Golden Globes). So why did Bradley Cooper not exactly deliver?Carey Mulligan's performance is certainly good, yet his directing lacks the creation of intimacy like he did with Lady Gaga in A Star Is Born. Most interactions are superficial, and you have to wait until the 75th minute to see the first powerful scene with strong dialogue and directing. The intro scenes are compelling up until the two main characters meet, but I found the rest of the first hour a mess. The second half of the film is surely better yet lacks urgency or dramatic tension in directing, even in the hospital scene. There is also a shortage of real wisdom or realisation in the script. We are left with a light and superficial understanding of the two main characters, even to the point where their respective love for music and acting and their love for each other is not really felt. Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) was much more successful in that aspect and Emily Blunt's performance.Cooper's acting also lacked some charm in my view, save perhaps a few scenes like in the end when he teaches a young conductor.Finally, Cooper's directing choices for cinematography left the very talented Matthew Libatique with not much to work with. In Black & White, 4:3 aspect ratio or even 16:9 color, few scenes seem to tell the story like a more claustrophobic The Whale (2022) was able to with his Darren Aronofsky collaboration. Libatique was nominated for an Oscar for his work with Aronofsky's fantastic Black Swan (2011) and with Cooper's sublime A Star is Born (2018).Better luck next time Coop! Good effort. 6.5/10.We can still see growth, grit and gusto, but misses the mark as a whole."
tt5535276,6.0,"Obviously made for the Academy to truly honor Bradley Cooper remarkable transformation into the hoity toity world of Leonard Bernstein. Yes, we know he is going to be great in this role. But sometimes when you surround yourself with Oscar level material and talent, it could seem like it's just fishing for the Little Gold dude.This is what it felt like. Though, simultaneously...he's just good.Actor turned directors don't always work. Especially virtuosos that started clownish and end up in the serious zone. Cooper is that guy. Following in the footsteps of Clint Eastwood rather than, say Charles Laughton. It felt like a natural transition for Cooper who seemed to fine tune his energies towards more serious endeavors outside of things like ""The Hangover"" flicks.""Silver Linings Playbook"" was the start.And who are his mentors in directing if it weren't the top tier directors.... David O' Russell, Paul Thomas Anderson, Spielberg, Scorsese or Clint Eastwood himself.What this film struggles with, is the interest level. A lot will go over modern audiences head. Simply because we only know him as the guy who did the music to ""West Side Story"" And even THAT is stretching it. Cooper doesn't focus his energy on that rather this ""love"" story of a woman who fell for a gay guy. This would've been interesting 30 years ago. Now, not as intriguing.Carey Mulligan is the best thing in this movie. At times, she is very much a Katherine Hepburn North Atlantic phony. But when some of the veil of her pain rises to the surface, she drops the pleasantries and tells it like it is.There is a moment during a Thanksgiving party where we see some of the best acting I've seen between two people. Dialogue is somewhat on the nose, but boy do they both play it to the hilt. It's phenomenal, the ability to get to a screaming match with the words actually meaning something. That is an accomplishment.Things get slow when the self-indulgent conducting moment creeps in. Yes, we know Brad studied a long time to get Bernstein's mannerisms. Do we really have to see all of it?Other things that bothered me... it still feels like a very cold movie. Aside from Mulligan, his entire family seems to have been plugged in as trope characters to get you more understanding of the guy. They don't add much. Perhaps that was attempting to be subtle. It felt like subterfuge.This was Oscar bait in absolute."
tt5535276,6.0,"Think of a biopic of a famous person as like a complex cake - you can carefully dissect one slice of it to examine the contents, or you can bravely try to examine the whole lot to see what it's made of.This biopic of American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein is like looking at only the surface of the cake through a slice of Swiss cheese - a lot of loosely connected vignettes with no depth. If you don't know much about the man, you would leave the theatre with no great insights about him.The film jumps around in time and gives you snippets of the man's life and work. There are scenes about his bisexuality and penchant for men, his role as a conductor and composer, his drug addictions and his relationship with his daughter, but none of these are examined in any depth at all. His bipolar relationship with his wife and her later death from cancer are given the most screen time, but still feels unfulfilled and lacking in substance.Bradley Cooper directs in a rather disjointed style. The first half is shot in black and white, then we change to colour for no good reason except maybe historical chronology - it doesn't work. Neither does the curiously tight aspect ratio, which again inexplicably opens up to full screen near the end. Some scenes are beautifully shot but too often Cooper relies on the slow zoom in and the very long takes, which don't always seem to match the scene. The film also could have ended perfectly with the penultimate scene, but inexplicably ruins the moment with one extra shot that completely fails to land.Carey Mulligan is excellent as Bernstein's wife but Cooper as Bernstein doesn't quite work for me. He tends to overact, gives you little insight into the man himself, and the nasal voice starts to grate after a while - maybe it was inevitable with the prosthetic nose he was required to wear.Even the grand concert scene in the cathedral, conducting his beloved Mahler, didn't quite generate the depth of feeling it could have - contrast this with the Tchaikovsky concert scene in the French-Russian film Le Concert, which takes emotion (actors and viewers) to a much higher level.All in all this is not a bad movie, and to be fair it does engage the viewer a little more in the second half. But it tackles too many themes with a disturbing superficiality, giving very little substance to almost any. It could have been a lot better. No doubt however it will get lots of Oscar nominations, but then the Academy lost the plot years ago and succumbs to hype more than merit."
tt5535276,6.0,"It's an old (and unanswerable) question: to what extent is it possible - or desirable - to separate the art from the artist? Is it possible to appreciate the art simply as art, and not to delve into the (sometimes tawdry) details of the artist? Or are the art and the artist so inextricably entwined that you cannot understand the one without knowing the other?I very much lean towards separation. I fell in love with Bernstein's music the first time I saw West Side Story mumble years ago at an impressionable age; which is why I was disappointed that there was so little West Side Story in this film. Surely a biopic of a composer should feature that composer's music pretty heavily?Of course, we all know that beneath every great artist is a human being - usually with a collection of human flaws. But does this matter? Well, it matters here. What we mostly get is a film about Leonard the man, and his complicated marriage to Felicia Montealegre. Much of this was new to me. I knew that Bernstein was bisexual, but didn't care. I find that I also don't care about most of the other details of his life which were revealed to me - although if the film was truly about the man, not his music, his record as a human rights activist should probably have been at least touched on. But never mind that: I came for the music, and didn't get enough.Not that this film is without merit. Bradley Cooper's performance is first class - there's one sequence in which he truly shows us the passion of a great conductor - and Carey Mulligan is as riveting as ever. Cinematography and sound are both excellent.Overall, this is a good film, but ultimately a disappointing one."
tt5535276,5.0,"Just watched it and unfortunately found it really boring while it could've been a great story about a really talented and colorful man with his ups and downs.Mulligan was the best part of the movie, she was playing with real emotion whereas Bradley Cooper was looked liked he is trying too hard.The story was super ordinary, not much substance to it. I felt like movie tried to make a big deal out of his sexuality but couldn't even reflect that effectively. It was like a fashion shoot to show how much Cooper tried to look like him. And I found the makeup really off putting with too much tan, Bernstein doesn't look that much tan, I don't know why they made him look like George Hamilton. There were 3 scenes really moved me (doctor's office, after the concert and home with kids) but that was it."
tt13287846,6.0,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
tt13287846,6.0,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
tt13287846,5.0,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
tt13287846,6.0,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
tt13287846,5.0,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
tt13287846,5.0,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
tt13287846,5.0,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
tt13287846,5.0,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
tt13287846,5.0,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
tt13287846,6.0,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
tt15671028,6.0,"No Hard Feelings is a pretty entertaining but unspectacular comedy. It will be sure to produce some good laughs, but the story is a little too paper thin and the characters a little too 2-dimensional for it to truly impress.It follows Jennifer Lawrence as 32 year old Maddie, who finds herself embroiled in a scheme to save her house by 'dating' a 19 year old at the behest of his parents.It's not the worst set up I've ever seen in a comedy, but it's not great either. Saying this, it does allow for plenty of comedic scenarios and is actually a pretty funny film, with numerous laugh out loud moments.As well as being funny it boasts two brilliant lead performances. Jennifer Lawrence is always brilliant so it's no surprise that she steals the show. I'd never even heard of Andrew Barth Feldman before, but he really shines in his role and plays it to perfection. The supporting cast is minimal, so it really is all about the two terrific performances from these two.My real gripe is with the plot. I don't think the emotional elements resonated as the characters are too poorly fleshed out. When the film gets bogged down in the emotional beat it slows down the pacing too much. I just didn't find myself getting invested in any of the characters, the outcome of the story (mostly because it was very predictable), or the emotional journey of it all.If you're looking for a late night comedy that will be sure to get you laughing, No Hard Feelings should do the trick. I highly doubt it will go down as a classic of the genre, but it does its job well enough."
tt15671028,5.0,"This movie instantly sold me on ""From the director of Good Boys."" I adore that movie. It's hysterical. No Hard Feelings has a similar tone and type of comedy. It's the kind that never feels like it's holding back. And the R-rating means it doesn't have to play it safe, which is awesome.For most of the movie, I was enjoying it. The premise is amusing and it's entertaining overall. But I didn't find it nearly as funny as Good Boys. And it leans much more heavily on the drama side, especially late in the movie when the comedic attempts are scarce.But the biggest downside is a few jaw-droppingly dumb moments during the last act. It swung my score from a mildly positive 6 to a mediocre 5. I didn't mind watching it, but I've seen much better. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 6/22/2023)"
tt15671028,5.0,"I admire Jennifer Lawrence as an actress and always enjoy seeing her on screen. Naturally, I looked forward to watching her in a new sex comedy called ""No Hard Feelings"", hoping for some laughs and a different genre. Regrettably, the movie did not meet my expectations, leaving me disappointed and uninterested.The film's premise is based on a viral Craigslist ad from a few years ago, where wealthy parents sought someone to date their introverted son and help him prepare for college. Lawrence portrays Maddie, a financially struggling Uber driver who responds to the ad and agrees to spend her summer with Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman), a nerdy 19-year-old living with his overprotective parents (Matthew Broderick and Laura Benanti).Although the movie attempts to be a raunchy comedy in the same vein as Superbad or The 40 Year Old Virgin, it falls short of delivering genuine laughs or emotional depth. The humour mainly relies on crude jokes involving nudity, bodily fluids, drugs, and sex toys that are predictable and lack originality.The characters in the film are one-dimensional and unlikeable, especially Maddie, who is supposed to be our protagonist but comes across as self-centred, manipulative, and irresponsible. Instead of treating Percy as an individual with his thoughts and feelings, she sees him as a project to exploit for personal gain. Similarly, Percy fails to exhibit any distinct personality or agency throughout the film; he simply complies with whatever Maddie instructs him to do without questioning her motivations or expressing his desires.""No Hard Feelings"" fails to delve into intriguing themes or convey insightful messages about sexuality, maturity or relationships. It misses opportunities to provide humorous yet thought-provoking commentary on growing up under pressure from society's expectations or navigating love in today's world. While I respect Jennifer Lawrence as an actress, ""No Hard Feelings"" did not deliver the enjoyable experience I had anticipated. The movie lacked the comedic spark and meaningful content found in successful films of its genre.Rather than delving into depth and exploring new ideas, the movie settles for tired clichés and stereotypes portraying sex as a mere objective to be checked off rather than a meaningful bond to be shared. The movie conveniently ignores the ethical and legal dilemmas presented by Maddie's arrangement with Percy's parents, who essentially exploit their son for financial gain. The film fails to address the power dynamics and issues of consent that are part of this arrangement.The only saving grace of ""No Hard Feelings"" is Jennifer Lawrence's commendable performance. She puts in her best efforts to make Maddie relatable and amusing, with some chemistry with Feldman in certain scenes. Lawrence also exhibits her impeccable comedic timing and mastery of physical comedy throughout the movie. But even her performance cannot salvage this film from being an utter waste of time and talent. ""No Hard Feelings"" is a disappointing and forgettable comedy that does not warrant your time or money."
tt15671028,6.0,"This movie is by no means perfect, but it is also smart enough to know what it is and what it isn't. The filmmakers know J Law is a legit comedy star, and they also know that this movie feels like an 80s throwback for a reason. That's how long it has been since Hollywood invested in this kind of simple set-up - awkward teen, protective parents, grizzled older woman, and plenty of awkward secrets and sex jokes. It is not rocket science, but the math still works. While the premise doesn't totally pay off and the third act tries a little too hard, it's still hard not to laugh. Sometimes a little charm and solid execution goes a long way."
tt12747748,5.0,"Difficult to say what the point of this was. It starts of quite well but the longer it goes on, the worse it gets. Any apocalypse movie can be interesting in the beginning - when neither the audience nor the characters know what's going on. The difficult part is to make the reasons for the apocalypse make sense and to make the rest of the movie interesting.The premise is interesting, but as soon as the characters start to put the pieces together, the movie ends abruptly. It is one of the weirdest endings I've ever seen. The characters had only solved about 80% of the mystery and it would be interesting to know what would happen next.This whole movie feels like an intro. It feels like a pilot episode of a TV-show. Perhaps they forgot to film the rest of the movie? But I also don't think there was much more to build with after the credits rolled. Still, an enjoyable movie with a great cast - Mahershala Ali was phenomenal."

too much of absolutely nothing.It's supposed to be a deep, political exploration of what would happen to the average citizen if America were to be destabilized.

tt12747748,6.0,"Started out with lots of promise for a thoughtful, tense thriller. But unfortunately that didn't come to pass. And unfortunately the ending didn't make up for the thin soup we were asked to digest for the previous hour and a half.I can't even say the acting was terrific, because it just seemed so . . . Adequate. And the direction was off and on, with some really good moments but way too many closeups of faces just wordlessly. . . Looking.Bless them all for trying but it just didn't hold my attention. Although I hung in there until what I hoped would be a revelatory and redeeming ending. But alas, no."

I mean, you can't go wrong with Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, and Kevin Bacon!!Except, you can. You can go way wrong with such an exceptional cast. I'll say this much, because again, I don't like to tell the whole movie, it'll have you waiting for something to happen. I waited for 2 hours for something as small as an explanation or a hint of what's going on here.The scenes changed without a clue as to what you just watched. I even thought the herd of 100 deer would at least give me some insight but no. Nothing. It was even a part where the buck emerged from the group, looking like he was ready to explain what's going on, but to my dismay, nothing.The ending was worse. It just ended. Wham bam, thank you ma'am. Left me with more questions than your average 5 year old in a museum. Since I can't get those 2 hours back, I'll give you 2 minutes of my time. Avoid this movie like the Plague, no, like we did Covid in 2020. You've been warned."
tt1856080,6.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's always disappointing when a book is so interesting and enjoyable to read, only to be followed up by a movie version that doesn't live up to the source material. My son recommended the 2013 best-selling non-fiction novel from Daniel James Brown, and it was truly fascinating to read such an inspirational story around the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Of course, we all know the Jesse Owens story, yet somehow the remarkable and unlikely tale of the University of Washington crew team never received the publicity it earned. Director George Clooney (GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, 2015) and screenwriter Mark L Smith (THE REVENANT, 2015) have attempted to reach a wider audience by adapting Brown's book for the big screen.The story begins in Seattle during the Great Depression. Engineering student Joe Rantz (an excellent Callum Turner, EMMA., 2020) is behind on his tuition and has had no luck securing work. We learn Joe has been on his own for years, and has remained focused on his education despite living in such poverty that he frequently goes without meals and uses folded newspapers to keep dirt and moisture out of the hole in his shoe sole. His buddy Roger (Sam Strike) informs him of crew tryouts, and a spot on the JV team comes with a job and stipend. No-nonsense coach Al Ulbrickson (Joel Edgerton) isn't much for motivational speeches and lets the rookies know most won't survive the training to claim one of the eight seats on the boat.Contradictory arguments can be made that director Clooney either took on too much of the story, or not enough. The result is a middling movie about an incredibly inspirational story of underdogs reaching the highest levels of achievement. Included here are only brief glimpses of the personal life of Coach Ulbrickson and his pertinent past, the motivation and wisdom of boat maker George Pocock (screen vet Peter Guiness), and the blossoming romance between Joe and Joyce (up and coming Hadley Robinson, LITTLE WOMEN, 2019). However, the biggest gap here is the connection and camaraderie between Joe and his teammates. The importance of working together ""as one"" is preached, but we aren't privy to how this happened so quickly. Skimming over this is the film's major flaw, as that bond is the key to their growth and success. By the end of the film, most will only recall Joe's name and two or three other faces on the team.The racing scenes on the water were surely challenging to film, and come across as realistic, even though we know these are actors and not world class athletes. The rich versus poor element is touched on, as are the politics which, yes, even existed in sports 90 years ago. Initially it's the newcomers against legendary coach Ky Ebright (Glenn Wrage) and his favored team from Cal, and then it becomes the blue-collar Washington boys against the Ivy League elites ... before heading to Berlin. The Olympics give us swastikas, a cheesy meet between the boys and Jessie Owens, and Daniel Philpott reprising his portrayal as Hitler from ""The Crown"", only with more outlandish mannerisms.The radio broadcasts provide a nostalgic look of how challenging it was to keep up with things during the era, and the newsreels are another nice touch. For those who have never been part of a crew, the term coxswain is likely a new one, and Clooney includes actual photos of the team over the closing credits. The memorable quote is ""We were never eight, we were one"", but for some reason director Clooney thought it a good idea to have a lame framing device set in more modern times around this historic tale. Somehow, we don't feel the adrenaline rush we should during this movie as it falls short of Oscar winner CHARIOTS OF FIRE (1981), perhaps the film that Clooney was attempting to mimic.Opening in theaters nationwide on December 25, 2023."
tt1856080,6.0,"As a former rower, I'm glad I saw this movie. There's a certain mental stamina, in addition to physical strength, required to row a boat fast and in sync with others that not many people realize. This movie definitely made an effort to capture that, but it didn't always quite hit the mark. The creators definitely felt a lot of respect for the sport, but I don't think they would have quite sold it to me if I didn't feel the same.The script was the biggest weak point for this movie. It was very uninspired, totally predictable. The dialogue was very wooden, and the characters were almost entirely flat. Joel Edgerton sold me on his character as a very guarded, stern-faced coach with a heart of gold, but the rest of the cast was pretty unremarkable. It's not all their fault though, most of them get very little to work with. The last scene actually made me roll my eyes, it was so cheesy and frankly amateur.The music was a interesting. I really didn't like the score in the opening and first few scenes, but it really got me at the story's pivotal moments. That should be what counts I guess.I did really enjoy the set though; the costumes to the production design were excellent and really painted a picture of an America that has been suffering from 5 years of the Depression that are starting to claw their way through hope and resilience to a bit of a better place.All and all, this was a really warm feel-good story, just not one of the best movies ever made. I'm glad I saw it, but will probably never watch it again."
tt1856080,6.0,"Went to see this as I was curious as to it being any good.It's 1936 & the University of Washington's rowing team race for Gold during the Depression-era in the 1936 Berlin Olympics.I found the film to be not bad, it was pretty good & straight forward enough. But my issue is the film lacked impact & could've been more upbeat. George Clooney did a good job & the film was entertaining enough, but I felt it could've been better in that respect.The actors do a good job here & the set pieces were decent, even though I felt the film could've been much shorter & to the point. The films runtime is 1 hour & 59 minutes (119 minutes), which is quite long I think, but funnily enough, the pacing wasn't too bad despite this, though you did feel it drag somewhat.Overall, it's a not bad film, the story is good & despite it's long runtime, slightly off but decent pacing & the lack of impact, the film was good.6/10."
tt1856080,6.0,"The story is incredible, so I was surprised how flat the movie was. Yes, you get some feel-good moments, but there were so many missed opportunities to make this a truly great movie. The narrative leaves a lot of loose ends that prevent us from connecting with the characters. The actors did their best with what was given, but I really wanted to know more about each character. There were also some shockingly cheesy elements - the intro and ending were completely superfluous, and just lame. The music score was corny and dated. The Boys in the Boat is worth watching once, but if you want the real story, read the book."
tt1856080,5.0,"Wow, director George Clooney is known for his lack of spark and punch in his movies that he himself directed, but at least he directed movies before that HAD a story, that HAD some sort of drama or suspense, everything this movie is now severely lacking from.SPOILERS: This story is SO predictable that it is numbing my brain. A team of rowers wants to win. They row. They row some more. And guess what?! They win. The end.Nothing happens in this movie. NOTHING. Why make an entire movie about rowing in a boat? At least the characters must be interesting then, right? WRONG. The characters are all neatly packaged, drawn between the lines, they have no chemistry, there simply is NO spark or punch.Not any good then? Dont get me wrong, it is a NICE movie, well acted and nicely filmed and if you are an elderly lady going to the cinema on a Sunday afternoon and you dont mind napping a few minutes while watching this movie, then this might just be the perfect non eventful sugarcoated movie for you..."

A lot of has been made about George Clooney's direction & he's acted I some great films but I don't think directing is his forte unless he produces directs & acts in a remake of Gone Wild with the Wind which he would be perfectly cast in the leading role - age doesn't matter. The 33 year old Callum Turner was playing the main protagonist who was a 22 year old university student who's father was 14 when he went to war in 1917 then left home in 1928 when Joe was 14 something really didn't add up here !? If the war was 1894 it must've been the sino Japanese war I'm sure the book will answer that question & I have a feeling the book is better than the filmSo in conclusion I'd say this only deserve a bronze medal the film had more passion for Nazi Germany which seem to be based in Hertfordshire than it did for an underdog embarrassing Hitler whilst on that subject Jessie Owen makes a brief appearance and maybe the biopic Race ( great play on words ) might be a better watchIf you're American 🇺🇸 ( I didn't notice if they got the flag wrong as it was 48 stars in 1936 but they probably did ) go & watch and root for #teamamerica if you're not then I doubt you'll come away punching the air with joyPoor showPad. A 5/10."
tt1856080,5.0,"I understand that an adaption can't include everything that the book does but this movie removed most of the heartwarming parts of the story.Joe's upbringing is glossed over, which is pretty critical to understanding why he was the way he was. He acts like he can barely be bothered by Joyce when that is not the case in the book and she's an endless support to him through this time with rowing and with his family.They also don't do a great job of truly showing the lifelong bonds that these guys made with each other because there's very few scenes of them outside of practice/competition.You don't see any of what's happening in Germany at the time and it's a strength of the book that it shows you how far hitler went to hide what was going on in an effort to make Germany look dignified. They also completely remove the revelation that Bobby is jewish for some crazy reason???It was just okay. They could have used the two hours way better."
tt1856080,5.0,"The screenwriting is terrible. Many, many lines are very hard to deliver with any kind of quality. It often felt like a hallmark movie about boats. Or a romance novel about the love of a good boat.And the direction is terrible. Really bad. So many scenes to be cut of people on their front porch, troubled, vey troubled.The story is ok. The movie would have been much better if there had been more of a focus on Joes past and more of each member of the crew. And much less varnishing. So much less caressing of boat undersides. Also the love story should have taken a big back seat. It was a big hit with the greatest generation crowd. Not so much with anyone younger."
tt13927994,5.0,"Devaratha (Prabhas) and Varadha Raja Mannar (Prithviraj Sukumaran) are best friends in Khansaar. Circumstances lead to Deva and his mother leaving Khansaar and living in exile, moving from city to city. Aadhya (Shruti Haasan) comes to India without informing her father and her life is at stake. Deva is assigned to safeguard her but he has to do it without his mother's knowledge as she disspproves his violent side. Protecting Aadhya pitches Deva right against Varadha and things aren't the same among the two friends turned foes. What happened to them in the world of Khansaar is something one is expected to watch in part 2, instead this part is about showing glimpses of where Deva had been and not what he did. Adding to that there are a bunch of baddies in Khansaar and the place's bloodied history connected to Deva.Prashant Neel has reworked his script of Ugramm in a much grand way, going all out in building a new world called Khansaar, just like he did with Narachi in KGF. That justifies him resorting to KGF narrative style for Salaar as well with his trademark quick cut aways and non-linear narrative with constant hero elevations. There are actually four of those in this film. The entire first half is dedicated to introducing and re-introducing Prabhas's Deva. Bigger canvas meant the mother - son segment taking a bigger hit and Neel has not been able to effectively crack it this time around. This is made up for by the terrific pre-interval action block and Prabhas's towering screen presence is put to good use even though his performance remained one toned. It is the entry scene of Prithviraj Sukumaran which had an impact.The second half is exclusive to establishing the world of Khansaar and it's several provinces as right from the King to the several lords are introduced along with the constitution of their own. This is where Salaar takes the bigger deviation from it's source material. The pace does get slow but the ones acquainted with KGF films, know exactly what to expect. The high moments are few but when they arrive, they explode. Asusual the final 15mins leads to an action segment giving both male leads equal opportunity to shine. Neel has kept majority of the story to be reserved for the sequel and this slightly disappoints. The final reveal is good enough to keep the intrigue for the sequel but barring those couple of scenes, the film's narrative is rather flat.Overall, it is not an exceptional intro though it succeeds in generating interest for the sequel. I am going with lenient rating due to the efforts put in to create this world and giving deserving Kannada actors a bigger film to showcase their acting skills."
tt13927994,5.0,"***Salaar Movie Review ***Directed by Prashant Neel starring Rebel Star Prabhas in the lead. Also starring Prithviraj SukumaranPrashant Neel's KGF, this was the reason for watching Salaar & an expectation that there will be link of KGF and Salaar but the later is not there.Coming to Salaar, the movie had given mass moments but it's kind feel of over injection of mass elements which creates a disinterest in watching.Prabhas had given the best with his swag and the way he delivers the action but a viewer who watched Yash in KGF, the same goosebumps is not having when watching Prabhas in Salaar. The background music had been used extensively to elevate the mass sequences which clearly gives an indication that its intentionally made.Prithviraj had given a decent performance.The last 30 minutes filled with action was interesting but when deep driving in the second half, many times the screenplay had been accelerated thereby a lot feeling that something is not going as per it is required.The core of the movie is similar to of KGF. It's about the POWER but Salaar had expressed in through the mode of friendship & violence..There will be a lot which needs to be unboxed in Part so Part 1 is an above average flick for me."
tt13927994,6.0,"Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey."
tt13927994,6.0,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent."
tt6495056,6.0,"I recently watched the movie Migration (2023) in theaters with my daughter. The storyline follows a northeastern family of ducks 🦆 who encounter a flock of migrating birds that invite them to fly south for the winter. Despite their usual winter stay, the family convinces the dad to fly to Jamaica 🇯🇲 this year, and an adventure ensues.This movie is co-directed by Benjamin Renner (Ernest & Celestine) and Guylo Homsy (Eddie's Life Coach) and features the voices of Kumail Nanjiani (Stuber), Danny DeVito (Twins), Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians), Keegan-Michael Key (Wonka), and Elizabeth Banks (The Hunger Games).The animation in this picture is outstanding, while the rest of the film is fairly average. The storyline is straightforward, with a few worthwhile subplots. I particularly enjoyed the husband and wife working together through various circumstances for the betterment of the family. The voices are well selected, and Awkwafina and DeVito comedic content keep the film well-paced. The conclusion is as expected, though its sequel potential remains uncertain.In conclusion, Migration is a fun family animated picture with enough worthwhile elements to make it worth a watch, but it doesn't stand out in the genre. I would score this a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it once."

Eventually they reach their destination and everyone lives happily ever after. Until the next adventure.Cute jokes. Mostly for kids. Some kind for the adults. Nothing risqué or off color.The most entertaining part was the pre movie short (a Minons story) that also seemed like a remake (of a Roadrunner Wiley Coyote short). Hi hum."
tt6495056,5.0,"I haven't been a fan of Illumination Entertainment movies as the only movies I have enjoyed from them were ""Despicable Me"" and ""Sing 2"". But many of their works really are just for kids and most of their style and writing is bland and has gotten on my nerves. Migration is new and different from their other works but as a whole, it was average at best.Throughout, many of the animation colors, structures, and models are pretty good as Illumination does a really good work on their animation designs. Including the models, the movements and the features. There are some solid sound designs as well. The writing from Mike White, who is known for his writing works on School of Rock, Year of the Dog, Brad's Status and Nacho Libre, isn't really special and while there are some ideas that I thought were pretty cool, it felt too generic and didn't feel as charming as it thinks which made it pretty boring. People say that it's trying to be original but it almost feels like a more unspecial version of ""Rio"". The director Benjamin Renner has created ""Ernest & Celestine"" and ""The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales..."" which are really great animated stories but unlike his previous works, Renner's direction and charm feels lacking and lost.The voice performances are solid as Kumail Nanjiani and Elizabeth Banks provide some solid emotions and vocal performances. The child voice performances honestly kind of got on my nerves. Most of the characters were typical and not really interesting, the humor is a bit stale and the dialogue is a mix of having some clever and some really awful lines. It's definitely for the younger audiences as my siblings did enjoy it which I am glad about. I do appreciate Illumination Entertainment making something original then their annoying works of Despicable Me and Minions stuff but the generic style doesn't do it for me.Overall, it's good for the children and the average internet user who loves animation but I feel like I should just stop watching movies from Illumination Entertainment at this point."
tt6495056,6.0,"A family of ducks live a quiet life on a pond. They are shoring up their home for winter. A flock of geese land on their pond and entice the family to fly to Jamaica. Mack ( Kumail Nanjiani ) rejects the idea but is later convinced by Uncle Dan (Danny DeVito) who lives as a hermit. His wife Pam (Elizabeth Banks) is elated, and so are the children Dax (Caspar Jennings ) and Gwen (Tresi Gazal). Dax has an inter-species crush on Kim (Isabela Merced ) who is a goose. The flight is met with challenges and horrors along the way as they meet some herons and later a chef in New York.This kid's story avoids the use of the word ""flocking"" as an obscene innuendo as did the other bird movie. The Minion opening was cute. Somewhere in the film is the voice of Bill Farmer famous for being Goofey. Other voices include Keegan-Michael Key, Awkwafina and Carol Cane."
tt13957560,5.0,"This is an important story, one that everyone should learn about -- the true version, at any rate; that includes understanding some technical (but not overly technical) details about what happened, and why.With this film, unfortunately (as with many others), Hollywood treats its viewers as 'dumb money'. This one prioritizes the industry's current identity politics mandate -- even over and above the class conflict and issues regarding market fairness -- over relaying critical information and details to the viewers about what sort of chicanery and shadiness actually transpired.As examples, the film did not even spend two minutes explaining to the viewers about: how the Robinhood app actually worked. E.g., the shares were NOT coming from the open market per se; Gill's actual views; what was really happening and said on Reddit; why the government ceased its investigation; the big money that got behind the short squeeze (e.g., Burry, R Cohen, et al); the IMPORTANCE of the disconnect between investing and investment ""fundamentals"" here (i.e., people investing not because they truly believed in the company's underlying value, and surely not merely holding stock and investing even more solely because Gill himself did so...).The filmmakers also enjoyed parading their current favourite American congressmen before the viewers. Funnily enough, however, the film ignored WHY those legislators' political colour team members in the Executive branch -- including the named oversight bodies -- quashed the investigations. One wonders why...A relatively popular four-part documentary on the GameStop saga is overly long and misses certain critical details (indeed, perhaps the most heinous tidbit in the tale). Even so, it's far superior to this movie. So, save your money and watch it, or a comparable documentary, instead. Alternatively, perhaps just read the book upon which this film was based?The acting was mostly good, but the script was weak and, again, the omissions in key details are unforgivable. A nice followup (independent) film would nevertheless be about the film industry being rigged too and how it's a propaganda tool."
tt13957560,6.0,"Even with its admirable intentions, in its writing, Dumb Money is, well, dumb. It's incessantly preachy and shallow, clinically moving from plot point to plot point while never examining any of its characters or happenings beneath the surface level.Granted, it doesn't necessarily need to. But it also doesn't present its scant narrative with enough style to make it compulsively watchable.Still, I found it impossible to dislike this movie. It tells the populist story that united everyone-right, left, and center-for a brief moment of euphoric social harmony. How can I not get wrapped up in reliving all that?Most of the cast brings charisma to their characters that was not on the page, and they are what is compelling about this film. That, and, even though the script has a dearth of insight, it's funny. It had loads of fast-paced dry wit that make it tough to not smile throughout.The performers and the humour really saved this movie, and though I don't think it'll have the impact the filmmakers were hoping for, it's a solidly good time. Just don't take it too seriously."
tt13957560,6.0,"To be perfectly honest, I have never quite understood how you could make money buying stock in a company that you actually wanted to go bust! I watched this and I'm still not really any the wiser. It all centres around the internet influencer Keith Gill (Paul Dano) who quite fancied the undervalued stock in a video game store called ""GameStop"". He started to suggest to his followers that this was a decent buy - despite the fairly obvious fact that the venture capitalists were selling the company short with a view to it collapsing. Slowly but surely the word spreads and the stock starts to rise. What now ensues is a worm that turns story as the gazillionaires at their polo clubs find these gadfly small investors really are becoming a fly in their vichyssoise. Can the little guy prevail? This is quite an enjoyably paced drama with it's roots in reality but for me, the acting was really lacklustre and it drew a really simplistically linear distinction between the have and the have nots that didn't really intrigue my brain. It certainly demonstrates the power of the internet and that galvanising the population can easily buck some established business practices but somehow I didn't especially admire the little guys here either - they were to varying degrees just as aspirational, wanted what the rich guys had and didn't much care how they got it! Still, it's enjoyable enough to watch but I'd wait til it is on the television."
tt10676048,5.0,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now. For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
tt10676048,6.0,"First if all, it is not a good movie. It jumps from one to another situation. Maybe better for the kind of movie it is. Marvel Studios often made a movie too long with lot of sideplots with a complete storyline in just one movie. So it didnt bother me at all. Acting wasnt good, but not awfull. Enough action, but not an overkill. Some funny scenes. Lot and lots of cgi and quite often too obvious present. But too be honest I never got bored, and had to smile once and a while. So in current wave of the MCU, which has been disappointing so far, this one was a relief. Eventhough I got a bit worried with the end scene. But then there was the midcreditscene which surprised me in a prositive way."
tt10676048,5.0,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
tt10676048,5.0,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
tt10676048,5.0,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
tt9054192,6.0,"This is a fun little movie about some women who sell stolen coupons on the internet.The premise is simple but solid. The film rests squarely on Kirsten and Kirby who are more than up for the task and they were great to watch.This could have been an absolute low-end classic like ""Office Space"" or ""Mad Money"" but it tries a little too hard to make this truly worth your time.The story has a lot of bloat to it that so easily could have been cut. The husband feels like he should be integral to the plot but is superfluous. He is only there to be a one dimensional butt-hole for Kristen to rail against. If anything it makes her character come across unnecessarily cold - ""I don't need you as I have loads of money now so see you later sucker!"".To pad the film out there is some toilet humour and over-acting jokes that just don't land.The relationship between the investigators was a nice touch but it feels like they couldn't decide what to do with the Loss Prevention officer and he sometimes felt like a cartoon character: stupid and irrelevant rather than a loveable buffoon.The plot strays in to silly-land with the hacker character and never really gets back on to solid ground, so any sense of tension was lost and it ended up being a full on comedy and I lost interest in the final outcome.Overall this is bouncy and fun with an adequate production and some funny jokes. It is good for a Sunday afternoon if you want something new but I think it only has one watch in it."
tt9054192,6.0,"This film wasn't deep, and at times it stretched credibility, but it was fun and engaging. I'd call it a buddy film on a couple of levels: The main characters, Connie and Jo, and then the sub-characters, Simon and Ken. The acting was solid, though the relatively unknown Paul Walter Hauser stole the movie. I'd recommend this film for unwinding on a Friday night after a long week."
tt9054192,6.0,"This one turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I had liked the trailer basically the plot but was expecting it to be just ok. But the tight script, good execution and editing makes it worthwhile. Kristen and Kirby get it right in each scene in the movie and Vince Vaughn though with limited screen time does a great job as well."

She comes up with the idea to steal coupons leading to a vast scam totally millions. The couponing scam is uncovered by store investigator Ken Miller (Paul Walter Hauser). He is joined by U. S. postal inspector Simon Kilmurry (Vince Vaughn).The first part is a bit quirky and slightly funny. It's fine. I like it. It works until the Lamborghinis. That's too dumb. I don't believe the girls are that dumb. I kept thinking that this is too dumb for these relatively well-spoken and relatively smart people. At that point, the movie turns more towards Dumb and Dumber. The investigation couple is even worst with a particularly infantile poop scene. The movie descends and doesn't get back up."
tt9054192,5.0,"Unfortunately, that good movie wasn't here. There were moments I truly enjoyed and laughed out loud, but they were few and far between. The tone was all over the place in writing, storyline and acting. If they were going for quirky and mixing genres, the writers should have taken a few more notes from something like Raising Arizona."

Since losing her baby she has become an avid coupon-er along with her friend JoJo (Kirby Howell-Baptiste ). They get the idea to obtain coupons from the factory in Mexico using an inside person. Long story short, they get too greedy and make millions that sent up a flag.This was a light comedy that will make you smile, but not laugh. I think what would have made the film good is if Ken (Paul Walter Hauser ) was her donor and used a fake profile.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
tt9054192,6.0,"The best thing about this movie is the actual story, which was INSPIRED by an actual similar event of a young woman collecting coupons by the hundreds, until she realised that IF ONLY she could produce these FREE coupons herself, she would have actual REAL MONENY in her hands with these coupons! And so it goes...The good: this movie has got a sweet, mellow kind of amusing humour, but it unfortunately never really elevates to laugh out loud humor, it stays nice ish, funny ish, but lacking spark and punch.The bad: somehow this comedy never really lifts off, never really sets things on fire. I blame the direction and the timing of the jokes. Several reviewers already mentioned that somewhere there is a good movie burried in there, but it somehow did not come to fruition...Mixed bag. Nice for 1 watch. Not terrible, but definitely not the greatest either."
tt11304740,5.0,"I had high hopes for this movie. After the box office flop 'Strange World', which looked loud and unappealing and most of all very un-Disney, it seemed this movie was going to be a return to form. It even promised the return of the great Disney villain, a concept strangely abandoned by the studio for almost a decade (preferring 'twist villains' or no villains instead).Sadly, the return of the villain is the only real benefit of this movie. For what it is, it's not terrible per se, but all is wholly forgettable, from the music to the animation to the characters. I'd say the latter is the most problematic aspect of 'Wish'. Asha is the most unoriginal, uninspired protagonist of any Disney movie. Even annoying leads in a Disney picture leave an impression, like the cows in 'Home On The Range'. Asha, on the other hand, not only looks like an identical twin of recent heroïnes like Anna, Mirabel and Rapunzel (the latter of whom she resembles most) but also acts like them. It's the exact same 'quirky awkward nervous teen girl' all over again without a shred of uniqueness that would make her a recognizable character of her own.It's hard to root for a heroïne as empty and shallow as that. Especially when the villain's objectives are equally as empty and shallow. He wants power over people because... he wants power over people? The story is severely lacking. You would expect more from Disney's outing in its 100th birthyear, but it basically boils down to something as banal as 'he has the wishes and she wants to give the wishes back'. It's not a very exciting proposition and there's not much you can do with such a bare bones simplistic story. Which I guess is where all the padding comes from. And by god, is it terrible.None of the goat's lines are funny. He's clearly meant as the funny sidekick but he didn't make me laugh even once. Nor did any of the other side characters, who are even more bland than Asha. Does anyone remember any joke from the movie that cracked a smile for them? I found the humor very much aimed at little kids, but then again I would say most of this movie is aimed at little kids. Even the animation looks like a saturday morning cartoon. It had a lot of potential, the blend of 2D with 3D. I will give the movie this: at least it looks different than the other Disney computer animated movies, the way handdrawn movies looked different (compare, say, 'Atlantis' to 'Lilo & Stitch').The most underwhelming aspect of this movie were the songs. Most of them are pointless, the lyrics are laughably weak and they fail to illuminate important plot points (as is customary in Disney musicals). I found them sadly unimaginative, not catchy or memorable, and with the villain song I was even hoping it would be over soon, that's how bad that one was. I also dislike the modern pop sound the songs had, which is jarring when shoehorned into a supposed fairytale. It makes you long for the days of the Disney Renaissance.All in all, 'Wish' is not the worst Disney movie by a long shot and it's wholly unoffensive and it had some potential but that potential was never realized. As it stands, it's a pretty mediocre film that serves as babysitter material on Disney+ but can't stand alongside the Classics of (even the recent) past."
tt11304740,6.0,"I saw this with my boyfriend tonight because it was discount tuesday at the movies and we both enjoy a good Disney flick. While there are some cute moments, overall it just wasn't that great of a film. The plot was weak, didn't have a lot of likable characters, villain is kind of random, humor didn't land, the songs were meh for the most part, and the payoff just wasn't there. I didn't care for the overused ""im so awkward and quirky"" trope on the main character. Also, while I typically love Disney songs, a lot of the songs/lyrics felt super verbose. I read one review that said the songs sounded like they were generated using AI, and while I don't know if that's necessarily true, I can definitely see what they mean. Kids will like it, it's a decent family movie, but it's not anything I need to watch twice. In my opinion, Disney has set a pretty high standard with its past films (Ratatouille, Tangled, Cars, the list goes on and on) and this one doesn't even come close to that standard. Onward is way better than Wish, maybe check that one out instead if you haven't already and are in the mood for a Disney movie. Just my opinion! My bf and I both give this one a 6.5/10."
tt11304740,5.0,"Yet another disappointment. Not a bad movie, but surely not a good one either. Even kids at the cinema were bored and almost none laughed throughout the movie, except just a handful of times. The plot was literally what you see on the trailer, there is no twist, nothing exciting to keep you interested, it was as bare bones as it could get. Nothing stood out, from the characters to the songs, it was from those movies you forget you watched after a month! It had too many references to old Disney movies, which got tiring after a while and the plot was rushed. I have no words, Disney was known for having great stories for the entire family to gather and enjoy, but now it's just generic and boring. I think it's time for Bob Iger to retire."
tt11304740,5.0,"WishIn this, Asha, a seventeen-year-old girl in the kingdom of Rosas, wishes upon a star which comes alive. Together they both team up to bring down the evil ruler of Rosas, Magnifico. Crafted to mark Disney's centennial, it serves as an origin story for the wishing star.Wish does a lot to pay homage to former Disney movies, in this it has a familiar air around it which doubles as a positive and negative. It's too familiar to the point that it's bland and the magic it tries to portray falls flat.The songs featured here vary from impressive to fair and then unnecessary but Ariana Debose who sings most of these songs has a beautiful voice that manages to shine through. The animation here is cool but nothing spectacular. The voice cast is capable.It's a shame that Wish is what Disney culminates its 100 years of animation on.4.5/10."
tt11304740,6.0,"Disney's 100th celebration falls flat with ""Wish,"" a film that struggles to maintain its own identity in the beloved Disney animated canon.Unfortunately the problem with the film is the story is so underdeveloped and poorly executed. There are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme, uneven pacing, and boring, flat characters. The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of ""showing"" the character beats like older films, we are ""told"" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring ""adorkable"" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Part of your World,"" ""Let it Go"" or ""We Don't Talk about Bruno"".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song ""I'm a Star"" in the movie is ""in this universe we are all shareholders."" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation. A massive disappointment to Disney's legacy and a poor excuse for their 100th animated film."
tt11304740,5.0,"In Wish, Disney honors their tradition, and at the same time adds a new movie to their catalogue of animated films. Wish is a nice movie, but lacks what makes Disney animated movies so special.In Wish, young Asha wishes on a star, and gets more than she bargained for when a star comes down to help her in her quest to defeat the evil king Magnifico.The greatest advantage the movie has is its gorgeous animation, the brushstrokes painted beautifully on the screen. It is a wondrous blend of hand-drawn animation and 3d animation, a la Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. I hope we get many more films animated in this style, as it is very relaxing and nice to look at.If only the story matched the visuals... An overly simple story lacks anything of substance. And yes, I'm taking into account that this is a kids movie. I sympathized with the villain (who did not begin the movie evil) in the beginning of the film, only for him to suddenly turn evil out of no where. The film also suffers from a horrifying over dependence on magic. The songs are very good, but they all sound about the same, which isn't a problem in the movie, but I can't imagine the music in this movie selling many CDs. I do have to give the voice actors some credit though. They didn't do anything award worthy, but they did an excellent job.That being said, while I watched this movie, I enjoyed it. The only reason I went to see it was to take my nephews. Disney has a rich history of making the greatest animated classics of all time. They have a proven formula that works, and I hope they either return to it in the future, or try something else besides Wish. It's a decent movie, but there's nothing memorable about it, and I don't expect it will be long before it is forgotten."
tt14998742,6.0,"I think Zack Snyder didn't really do much research into this one. Maybe it's because it's a Netflix thing, I am not sure. There's so much borrowing from several other popular movies that I just wasn't invested in the story because it was all tooo basic and predictable.You had the Thanos and Gamora moment in there, you are the Starwars Resistance vs The First Order moment in there. You had the Darthvader type figure in there. You had the Kylo Ren character in there. And the worlds looked like something from a Starwars episode.Also the whole story was just weak, too weak for a director like Zack. I mean we've seen it done so many times from Lord of the Rings, to Game of Thrones, to even The Avengers. You are threatened by a bigger force, so you go around recruiting people to help you fight this force. That's basically it. There wasn't any rich subplot like we see in eg. Dune. Just very basic.Does it warrant a part 2, I strongly don't think it did. It's lazy writing and directing and shouldn't be encouraged.All in all, it's an ok movie. It's not bad like some reviews are saying. The effects are spot on, I loved the cinematography. The only drawbacks for me were the weak storyline, the awful fight sequence, the casting could have been better and the all too familiar scenes."

And not just the main storyline which makes little sense and the villains are comedic, but almost every interaction ends up with the viewer asking ""but, why?"" or ""how does it even make sense?"".The assembly of heroes (what the movie is about) is also rushed as hell, and the motivation of the people to join is straight-up nonexistent in most of the cases and is simply skipped entirely.As for the villain who comes to find mysterious troubling rebels, apparently every single person knows who are the rebels and how to find them and shares that information to the first stranger they meet. It's not like they are even hiding.Next, combat and action scenes. Blasters that penetrate people in armor through, but can't penetrate a thin piece of wood. Remember when in the new Star Wars trilogy a red guard could strike Ray but was just making dumb random moves to simulate action? Well, it's absolutely the same here. Maximum drama, lots of slow motion, frequent switch of the scenes every few seconds and very little sense.The acting is ok, but it's difficult to judge the actors if they do good because the script tells them to follow an unnatural character arc in the first place. I'd say Sofia played Kora well, but Kora is just a poor character which is out of place in the very story she's central.It's not all bad. The picture is nice.I'd say it's the most disappointing Snyder's movie so far."
tt14998742,5.0,"Ah, the bittersweet symphony of ""Rebel Moon."" I hear you there, fellow traveler to Pandora and Tatooine. We can both appreciate Zack Snyder's stylistic flourishes - the slow-mo ballet of violence, the operatic landscapes, the characters carved from myth. But as the curtain falls on ""Part One,"" a mournful sigh escapes. This could have been a glorious space opera, a love letter to sci-fi's golden age, yet it stumbles over familiar tropes and squanders its vast potential.Snyder's fingerprints are all over the screen. The visuals are undeniable - gargantuan spaceships casting ominous shadows, crimson blades carving through darkness, desert vistas whispering forgotten empires. He paints with a grand brush, but the canvas starts to feel repetitive. We've seen the grizzled warrior with a troubled past, the damsel in distress with hidden fire, the villain who chews scenery like it's his birthright. It's a well-worn costume rack, and while Snyder drapes it with his signature flair, the threads of originality begin to fray.The plot, a familiar melody of rebellion against tyranny, starts strong but loses its harmonic richness. Characters, instead of complex chords, become predictable arpeggios. Their motivations are thinly veiled, their backstories a rushed montage. The dialogue, meant to resonate like thunder, echoes with the hollowness of recycled sci-fi cliches.What hurts most is the unrealized potential. The glimpses of a deeper world, the whispers of ancient powers, the seeds of a nuanced conflict - all wither in the harsh glare of action sequences. Snyder loves his spectacle, and ""Rebel Moon"" is awash in it, but spectacle alone can't sustain a film. We crave emotion, depth, resonance. We want to be swept away, not merely bombarded.So, as the credits roll, a bittersweet symphony resonates. We acknowledge the maestro's talent, the flashes of brilliance, the echoes of what could have been. But the lingering taste is one of missed notes, of potential left unrealized. ""Rebel Moon"" is a spectacle, no doubt, but a hollow one, leaving us yearning for the sci-fi opera that might have been."
tt14998742,5.0,"The Zack Snyder fanboy cult is legion. That's fine. Every crowd likes their own kind of music.Objectively this is what Snyder produces: gritty, dark, unhappy, overly serious, tedious stuff. Most of its average, with a few exceptions. But there's always cool stuff to look at. The usual Snyder-verse effects are on full display: long establishing shots, fight scenes using slo-mo and speed shifting, and massive objects being viewed by terrified onlookers. He's kind of a poor man's Villaneuve.The rabid followers can say what they want about ""The Snyder Cut"" Justice League, but the reality is there's no broad market for unrelentingly dismal sludge. Why isn't there a Judge Dredd movie coming out soon? Or another Punisher film? Dark and too serious isn't fun to spend money on. Especially when it's not all that new.I do have to laugh though, at all the media hacks that are pissing and moaning about how derivative this is. And it is. But it mostly feels that way because Snyder wrote a script for a stand alone Star Wars story and was told by Lucasfilm (or maybe it was Disney) ""thanks, but no thanks"".So he went to the streaming giant that loves to produce expensive projects so they can cancel them before they can develop any traction. This is that script brought to life. Or death, as Netflix may have it.It's not nice to hammer on creatives. But I for one am sick and tired of the waif-ish 90 pound girl warrior movies that have been all the rage lately. And while Boutella (Kora, the protagonist in Rebel Moon) was excellent as Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond, I'm over it. Other than Gunpowder Milkshake (which was hilarious) it's all a bunch of BS. I don't care if Maggie Q or Daisy Ridley (both decent actresses btw) are in it or not (they aren't in this, in case you're confused), it's stupid. It was bad enough when Arnold, Sly and Bruce were ignoring the laws of physics in their various franchises, but we're all a little more savvy now and wouldn't buy that stuff from them in today's market either. But maybe I'm wrong, because there are now 4 Expendables movies in existence. God save us from the people who are buying tickets to those.The review of the performances? Boutella? Strictly two note delivery. Honsu? Not bad, dour and angry. Hunaam? Possibly the most nuanced.The plot? Star Wars excuse aside, it's a mess. The preposterousness of engaging with their Seven Samurai recruits at moments when each is faced with a crucial test is just lazy storytelling.The villains? One dimensional and very unconvincing. One, the most visible, a bizarre space nazi foil, is so predictable and poorly written that he could be dropped into any of a number of other films. The other? The supposedly all powerful Big Bad who apparently has the power of life over death is a comic book trope of a villain. Evil for evil's sake. And the dumb resurrection of the former by the latter begs the question: how do you threaten a subordinate that you just brought back to life? And instead of original visuals, Snyder dips deeply into the visually obscene as replacement for creativity. The very last image is of a rogue droid, having gone ""wild"" after killing one of its ""masters"", standing up in a field, wearing a crown of deer antlers. Now that would have been a story worth exploring.There are much better choices to spend two hours on. Watch Rogue One, which at its core, this movie wishes it was.It's free to subscribers now, so have at it. Can't wait to see those reviews pour in."
tt14998742,6.0,"Greetings from the other side.The visuals in this movie are just awesome, but it's lacking substance. First, I'm sick of the 100 pound women taking on a bunch of 240 pound men and winning. Nobody has ever bought this crap, and it takes you out of the movie. Try letting the women use her brain to out think these bad guys instead.It's hard to judge this movie on it's own because it's basically a women zipping around the galaxy putting together a team to fight the bad guys. We get to know each recruit a little bit as they are approached by the woman.So, this movie is watchable for the special effects, but not much else. It's basically an introduction of all the characters and a basic background of the woman's story. It doesn't offer much by itself. They should have made this a 3.5 or 4 hour movie and included part 2.Anyway, it's still watchable but by itself, it's not very memorable. Part 2 will determine if this movie is good or not."
tt14998742,5.0,"Like some others have said...it's got all the pieces but it's disjointed on so many levels it's hard to put a finger on it. Story could be something to build on but it's executed in such a hallow way the characters seem overly ridiculously evil or naive . Fight scenes are annoying my shot from fast to slow motion, not in a good way.They have good actors, I'm not sure why everyone seems so wooded in their dialect.Did I mention scenes go to slow motion for no paticular reason, then go back to normal speed. I'm curious if it's a funding issue. It almost seem the script was very loosely boarded and everyone improvised."
tt14998742,5.0,"The acting isn't bad, the production quality is pretty good. The story feels old, tired, and way too long.If Zack Snyder wanted to do a Sci-fi like this, he should have tried to get with an established franchise. Gamesworkshop's warhammer 40k has a load of great stories that this could have been tweeked to fit. If they had then it wouldn't have been so boring.There's action, but it's dull. There's reason to cafe about the characters, but you still don't. It's just not a good movie. The fact that there's going to be a part 2 is just absurd. Part 1 is a waste of time, i doubt I would bother with part 2."
tt14998742,5.0,"Rebel Moon felt like a promising new world as it begun but in the end it just felt like a weak assemble attempt that is a ripoff of different existing characters and movies.Sofia Boutella is more like the backbone of this saga, a strong performance despite all the wears and tears the movie have. Good Visuals and cinematography are another factors that makes the whole film watchable.Still this movie goes nowhere despite a promising start. It just turns into intro of some characters from here and there worlds. Moreover characters are wasted in the name of plot twist to provide a forced climax. Meh that climax is basically the cringe twist in every universe.In the end Zack Snyder attempt creates a visually massive new world but falls way short with purpose and its ripoff characters."
tt26084002,6.0,"Self Reliance has the kind of premise that can carry a movie on its own. It's so intriguing and had me hooked immediately. And it's taken in a bunch of cool directions.At one point, I thought of an easy way to win the game. I expected the movie to ignore it for other strategies that aren't as smart or effective. To my surprise, the movie does exactly what I was thinking. And they find a subsequent reason for it to not end the game.Jake Johnson gives a good performance. The only reason I didn't like this more is the lack of laughs. One of the genres listed is comedy but I laughed only a few times. It's more amusing than funny. That's the only thing holding it back from being something great that I continue to revisit. But it's still a solid and enjoyable one-time viewing.(1 viewing, 1/12/2024)"

The problem is that while 30% of the first part of the movie will hook you, the last 70% will bore you so much you might even get up and walk out of the sofa. I understand that that was both directed and written by Jake Johnson, but if he had more input from another writer, this could have become a cult classic. Instead we're left with something that feels unfinished, lost, confused and plain frankly, not a comedy and more of a ""thriller"". If they had more ideas to the story, more characters and more drama, this could have been a golden nugget."

On your journey you'll encounter those who may become your friends, as well as those quite keen to bring existence to an end, there'll be those living in shadows, impersonators in costumed clothes, but as the film continues, you will question, what's been penned. As like me you may sit static without laughing or a smirk, as the humour is quite lacking and poor Tommy is a berk, although you may feel sympathetic, to his plight that's quite prophetic, alas the value it delivers, is most likely to just irk."
tt26084002,6.0,Self Reliance is a fun debut directing gig from Jake Johnson. Johnson takes an interesting premise and brings some good moments to it although not quite sticking the landing.The movie could have went in a more intriguing direction by giving it more of a horror vibe when the attacks happen. You never get the sense Johnson is in any real danger.The real heart of the movie is between Johnson and Anna Kendrick who's easy chemistry together makes the movie. The stuff featuring Kendrick are the movies standout scenes.There are some nice cameos from Andy Samberg & Christopher Lloyd. Ultimately it is Jake Johnson's charm that carries the movie but this still feels like a missed opportunity. Recommendable.
tt26084002,5.0,"2.5 out of 5 stars.Self-Reliance is a pretty bad comedy thriller film that has a promising concept about a guy getting picked for a reality dark web show. Where he has to survive 30 days from the hunters to win money. And a flaw that the hunters cant attack when they are nearby people.Plot was okay. Jake Johnson did good and was funny with the role. The humor and script does not last throughout the film. Humor can barely last so long in the film which falls flat by the time it reaches the third act. The direction and script falls tedious in the end. Anna Kendrick was also okay for a small portion of the film. Which the movie fails to let us know what happens to her in the end.Overall, it is a comedy film that has a few laughs while falling flat in the end."
tt26084002,5.0,"Normally I would get excited at an Andy Samberg appearance, but he was literally on screen for under 10 minutes. This was a jokey movie making light of a game to the death where a bunch of unknowns can hunt you down and kill you - on the surface it sounds very akin to the Ice T movie Surviving the Game which I would argue is a classic and very well done. But instead they really only clarify one rule, which is that as long as you're within reach of another person then the ninja secret people can't kill you. And to top it off they try to turn it into a love story. Overall a very blah movie that just wasn't very funny. The best part was the relationship he developed with the hobo."
tt26084002,5.0,"Truth be told, the film has a very fun and interesting first act, and it gives you a (false) hope of the subsequent ones being equally humourous and engaging, if not more. What you get instead is a poorly written mid-section, when Anna Kendrick's character Maddy randomly arrives. The film then sheds its frequently funny + mildly intriguing skin to turn into a spontaneous romance of sorts. It helps that Jake is a natural charmer and keeps the film afloat even in its weirdest moments (including one where he and Kendrick are throwing shade at a motel janitor in the middle of the night).Once Kendrick's manic-pixie disappears, the film again becomes riveting with moments of hilarity. The WTF moments are compellingly executed (and there are quite a few of them - hello, fake Ellen DeGeneres!), to the point of making you wonder whether it's all playing out in the protagonist's head. Jake, donning the hats of writer, director, and lead actor, may have had too much on his plate for the film's eventual landing to stick. It swings between funny and serious, and since the general tone tilts more towards the former, it's difficult to take the ""life-threatening"" aspects as earnestly. I couldn't help but feel that Jake had a bunch of strong ideas, but he failed to follow through on at least some of them.Endnote: Did we really need the Wayne Brady scene at the end? That killed off even the slightest bit of ambiguity."
tt8338076,5.0,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After reluctantly agreeing to move into a senior's home, a 90-year old woman encounters a clique of mean-spirited senior women and an unexpected amorous widower. Some people are describing this movie as a mix between
Mean Girls and The Golden Girls, but that's not entirely accurate.The comedy was directed by Michael Lembeck who also brought us sugary-sweet comedies like The Santa Clause & The Santa Clause 2, Tooth Fairy, and a bunch of TV shows. I was curious about this movie because I recently moved my mother into a Memory Care facility. The people and the facility portrayed in the film are nothing like where my mother is, sadly. Everyone at my mother's place is way too old and feeble to get into the kind of trouble these characters do in the movie.The dramedy is definitely targeted to Baby Boomers and beyond, but I still got a kick out of it. It's great to have some movies that appeal to older audiences.THINGS I LIKED:
It's great to see Ellen Burstyn. In real life, she's 88 years old. What a smile and twinkle she still has.Fun fact: Three of the leading ladies play a character whose name is very close to her own: Ellen Burstyn plays ""Helen""; Ann-Margret plays ""Margot"" and Jane Curtin plays ""Janet."" It didn't seem possible to me that SNL star Jane Curtin would be old enough to even be in a retirement home, so I had to look up her age; she's only 73 years old. The older I get, the younger that sounds!The movie opens with delightful, chipper music which continues throughout.The vintage cast also includes Loretta Devine, Christopher Lloyd, James Caan, and French Stewart.You get to learn about some Filipino food from the comical massage therapist played by Alec Mapa.There are some very touching moments that'll get you teary-eyed.I laughed at all the walkers lining the church pews in one of the scenes. They should have actually played that up more in the film. Instead, all of the seniors are extremely mobile.The grandson, played by Matthew Barnes is the perfect grandson any grandma would ever wish for.I felt bad for Elizabeth Mitchell who had to play such a cranky daughter. I've always thought she was so pretty and usually has such a gentle demeanor.There's a little twist in the story, but I don't want to spoil it for you...
There is some cute humor.Keep watching during the rolling credits for some very sweet pictures of couples who married later in life.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
If you're over 50 years old, you'll remember these stars in their hey-dey, which makes it more fun to watch them in this. Younger viewers may be mildly entertained without knowing the actors, but this film will definitely appeal more to an older audience.It's super cheesy, but there's nothing wrong with cheesy, especially if you're old!It's a little heartbreaking to see some of our long-time favorites get old.The pacing changes throughout the film.There is some edginess at the beginning with sarcastic characters, but then syrup gets dripped all over the script and things are neatly tied up with a bow.Nobody really likes watching super old people kiss and talk about intimate relations.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Kids are definitely going to be bored.Some ""mild"" profanity
Two of the old women get high smoking a joint.Talk of a ""tata towel"" and the comment ""Keep 'em high, keep 'em dry."" Women will laugh and be able to relate but everyone else will be grossed out.l!"

So you make it following the directions and sit down to eat and something is just missing?That's Queen Bees. Given the list of very accomplished stars, the premise, the trailer, everything should work together really well. But it doesn't. In fact, it fails... just short of miserably.The Rom was cringeworthy. The Com was virtually non-existent. The plot twist was predictable from the very first line uttered by the character.So sad because the recipe looked so good."
tt8338076,6.0,This is a trifle of a movie whose storyline is very predictible.The to other woman (besides Burstyn) are just OK in theor replaceable roles.Jimmy Cahn who is a great actor seems way out of place and uncomfortable in this flick. He also may have back problems because he seems to be all hunched over and has ginormous shoulder pads in his shirts that look so weird.The one to watch is Ellen Burstyn. She's 88 years old and is clearly a fabulous actress. And I mean fabulous. She blows Meryl Streep out of the water. Three times over.It's a not so great movie who's only saving grace is Ellen.One criticism: Why did they have to add so much left wing politics in this flick? Arent we sick of politics? The story didnt need it.
tt8338076,6.0,"This is a pleasant movie mostly about older people, 70s and 80s, getting along with each other in a retirement community, sort of a ""final resting place."" It follows the general feel of a Hallmark-type movie, two single people are attracted to each other, they begin to get along great, something is revealed that splits them apart, then we watch to see how they will overcome the difficulty.Filmed in Atlanta, Burstyn plays a widow living in the long-time family home and very happy to stay there. However when she absentmindedly goes out at night to quickly dispose of some garbage, leaving food cooking, then locks herself out, the result is a kitchen fire that will require a few weeks to repair. She will stay at the retirement community for at most a month. On her first day she encounters the four ladies, Bridge Club members, known as the ""Queen Bees"" and not for flattering reasons. And, as additional problems develop back home, ends up staying more than the month she thought initially.My wife and I enjoyed it at home on DVD from our public library. The story is told in mostly very predictable directions but it is pleasant and it is filled with many favorite actors from the past 60 years. Including Ann-Margret who just turned 80."
tt13651794,5.0,"'' May December '' is a drama about an actress who is about to portray the story of a sex offender, and so she starts spending time with her in order to prepare for her movie.The movie has an intriguing story, and you get the feeling right from the start that there is something even more sinister about those characters that is about to rear its ugly head at any moment. However, that never happens. In fact, in the end, nothing happens. Things remain where they are, and the audiance, who knows that no one is who they appear to be, is left perplexed.However, the performances were strong from the two leads, Portman and Moore. But, other than that, the movie is a let down."
tt13651794,6.0,"Maybe I had too many high expectations for this film. But the script is all over the place and many of its plot points raised more questions than answers.First of all, why would it only be the lead actress Elizabeth (Natalie Portman) who is spending time with the family her film is focused on? Surely that's for the director and the screenwriter to unpack? I understand she wanted to get into her character and meet the woman she would be playing. But then she does something completely innappropriate, and there are no consequences for it.With Gracie, in the end, there really isn't much more to unpack than what we already know from the beginning. She is a sexual predator and a child rapist who ended up marrying her victim and had kids with him. That's it.Joe, on the other hand, is probably the most interesting part of the film. His character goes through a lot and is the most conflicted out of all of them. He slowly realises that the decision to stay with his abuser and raise a family was done out of naivety, youth and possibly grooming. Now that he, as well as all of his children, have grown up, he starts to mature and question his life.So perhaps the film should have been only from his point of view and not Elizabeth's, as she was very undeveloped and vapid.In the end, not that all impressed."
tt13651794,5.0,"In moviemaking, there's subtlety, and then there's subtlety carried too far. In the case of director Todd Haynes's latest, the filmmaker unfortunately indulges himself far too much in the latter. This story of an actress (Natalie Portman) who visits a middle-aged sex offender (Julianne Moore) to prepare for a role she's about to play in a movie about her subject's life never seems to find a footing to stick with and explore. The narrative examines many different aspects of the back story behind the lives of the characters to be portrayed in this pending production without ever really resolving any of them by the time the credits roll. This includes not only the protagonist's reasons for pursuing her once-underage husband (Charles Melton) - actions that got her jailed and made her fodder for countless tawdry tabloid cover stories - but also the nature of the actress's real motivations in conducting such an excessively intense in-depth study of her character. In the process, virtually everyone comes across as somewhat unsavory, and, considering that the truth is never clearly revealed about any of them, it begs the question, why should we care about any of this? The film depicts all of this so subtly that it goes beyond nuance, veering into the realm of enigmatic, thereby further reinforcing the notion of why any of us should care. Ironically, these underplayed elements are in stark contrast to some rather obvious (and terribly trite) symbolism, particularly in images related to themes of transition and transformation. The picture's inconsistent changes in tone don't help, either, vacillating between allegedly serious drama and a seemingly underdeveloped desire to break out as an exercise in full-fledged camp (which, by the way, probably would have made this a much better offering). The script's meandering flow and glacial pacing also don't help, leaving viewers scratching their heads more often than not as to where this story is headed. In the end, all of the foregoing is ultimately quite unfortunate, because there's definite potential in this project, but it's never adequately defined and fleshed out. Leads Moore and (especially) Portman turn in admirable efforts to make this material fly, but they simply don't have enough to work with to make that happen. While there appear to be allusions to themes like the difficulty involved in dealing with long-buried feelings and the fact that we may never be able to adequately grasp the truth behind them (either as outsiders looking in or as active participants in the midst of such dealings), the cryptic handling of those ideas undermines whatever meaningful messages or cinematic value they might have, making all of this seem like just such a big waste of time. Director Haynes has an impressive filmography behind him with such releases as ""Poison"" (1991), ""Far From Heaven"" (2002) and ""Dark Waters"" (2019), but, regrettably, ""May December"" certainly can't be counted as part of that list."
tt13651794,5.0,"Let me start with a brief outline of the plot which is ""loosely"" based on actual events. To avoid confusion, I'll make no reference to the actual events. The ""facts"" in my outline reflects what is presented in the movie.Some 20 years ago, 36-year-old married woman Gracie (Julianne Moore) had sex with a 13-year-old boy Joe (Charles Melton), got convicted for child rape and, in prison, gave birth to a girl fathered by Joe. After serving her term, she married Joe, and they had a pair of twins. The family of five carries on, at present, as a perfectly normal, happy middle-class family, living in a large waterfront house in Savannah.While the incident, needless to say, was met with considerable public indignation, it was after all two decades ago. To Gracie, it is as if it had never happened. The only thing slightly out of the ordinary about her marriage, to Gracie, is the age and ethnic differences (Joe is half-Korean, in fact both the character and the actor), neither of which should cause even a raise in eyebrows.The story really starts when someone decides to make a movie out of Gracie's story. Elizabeth (Natalie Portman) who has been cast to portray Gracie, visits them in the aforementioned idyllic Savannah neighborhood.While nothing seems to be out of the ordinary, there are a couple of suggestive hints in the opening scenes. The house is bubbling with activities, barbecuing and swimming outside (with screaming kids) and kitchen preparations inside. Gracie goes to the fridge, opens it. For a split second, the expression on her face brings flashes of a scene in Stephen King's ""It"", when somebody opens the fridge and sees Stanley Uris's severed head inside. What Gracie mumbles, however, is not quite as exciting ""There aren't enough hot dogs"". But why such exaggeration? I think that is to serve notice that while ""May December"" is billed as comedy (indeed included in that category in the Golden Globe best picture nomination), don't expect an easy ride.After Elizabeth's arrival and getting acquainted with the family, there is nothing unusual about an actor's effort in understanding the protagonist she is going to portray. Yet, consider this first exchange at the door of the house where the two women first meet. Elizabeth says ""oh, I though you would be taller"". Nothing unusual in that. Gracie replies ""We are basically the same size"". Nothing unusual. Without missing a beat comes Elizabeth's rejoinder ""We are basically the same"". Suggestive.As characters interact, morsels of their personality and experiences, when revealed, serve to mystify, rather than clarify. When the two women chat casually while working on some floral arrangements, Gracie intimates that she does not dwell on the past. Elizabeth acknowledges that she is exactly the opposite.There is no convoluted plot. Not even a plot in the conventional sense, you may say. Part of the movie runs like Elizabeth's investigation procedurals, setting up meetings and talking to various people, starting with Gracie's ex-husband, followed by an assortment of individuals who might be able to help her understand the woman she will be portraying. Another part of the movie dwells on the relationship between Gracie and Joe which, after 20 years, might have hit a tricky point when the empty-nester scenario is just around the corner.The persistently presence of piano background music, often intense, sometimes dramatic, but never soothing, is sufficient to convey the director's message to the audience. Is everything the way it seems, or are there intriguing layers if you dig below the surface? There are innuendos aplenty, but no definite answers.Gracie's history would obviously invite suspicions of whether she is the uncomplicated, simple, contented woman now, approaching her sixties. In one scene, Joe finds her breaking down in tears. The reason turns out to be just that a much-valued order for her catering service is cancelled. Towards the end, when husband and wife are having their domestic discussions, Gracie challenges Joe on who really started ""the incident"". She went to jail because he was a minor (only 13). But ""who was in charge?"" Gracie challenged. In no uncertain terms is her conviction (no pun intended) that he seduced her. Does the movie give an answer? Sorry, no.What about Elizabeth? One may see her only as surrogate for the audience, trying to find ""something true, something honest"" about this scandal that happened 20 years ago. But it is quite logical, and simpler, to see her as a perfectionist of an actor, trying to understand her subject as best she can before she goes before the camera. She wants to ""become Gracie"", but what's wrong with that? I am not sure if this can be called ""method acting"" but it will be something of the sort, anyway. The one time we get tantalizingly close to seeing a ""revelation"" of Elizabeth is when she is invited to speak to local drama students. The first salvo from a smart-Alex student is ""have you played sex scenes?"" But, interesting as the talk is, it does not show anything about Elizabeth you don't expect from a profession screen (and occasionally stage) actor.Joe, consistently minimalistic throughout the movie, is unfortunately not really an enigma either. This is a typical kidult who still hasn't grown up, not under the thumb of parents as in normal cases, but of a wife 23 years older. The poignancy brought out by Melton's superb acting is a highlight in this movie. Watch for the scene with Joe smoking pot with his son on roof top. When he breaks down in tears, it is more than obvious that despite age and appearance, who is really the adult and who is the kid.""May December"" is a clever exercise in style, sustained by three top-notch performances."
tt13651794,5.0,"It's a drama set in the spring of 2015 in Savannah, Georgia. It follows the visit of actor Elizabeth Berry (Natalie Portman) to a couple who were the subject of a major scandal in 1992. At that time, Gracie Atherton (Julianne Moore), a married woman with children who worked in a pet shop, had an affair with a 13-year-old boy, Joe Yoo (Charles Melton), and bore his child. She served prison time and later married Joe; they now have three children. The two twins, Mary (Elizabeth Yu) and Charlie (Gabriel Chung) are about to graduate from high school.Elizabeth is to play the role of Gracie in a TV movie. We also meet Gracie's first husband, Tom (D. W. Moffett), and son, Georgie (Cory Michael Smith), from her first marriage. The movie follows Elizabeth's investigation into Gracie's life, which results in picking up some ambiguous messages. She also begins to identify with Gracie in some strange ways.""May December"" was a significant disappointment. Julianne Moore gives a strong performance, but the storyline wanders without apparent direction. The Portman character veers in mystifying directions and arrives at an ending with little logic. The Moffett, Smith, and Melton characters remain too undefined despite their centrality to the story. This lack means an underdeveloped script."
tt13651794,5.0,"In peculiar character drama ""May December"" married couple Julianne Moore & Charles Melton are notorious in their Georgia hometown, as 23 yrs earlier she (at 36) first seduced him (at 13) - subsequently having their first child behind bars. 23yrs on, with two more kids (twins) about to graduate, actress Natalie Portman comes to stay with them as she prepares to play Moore in a movie - which stirs emotions, heightens traits, and draws memories / accusations. The experienced Todd Haynes directs Samy Burch's debut screenplay with an odd, slightly stylized tone (including with the bizarre score) before ending on ambiguity (sigh). Yes, it's a strange one."
tt13651794,6.0,"I thought it was boring and slow. They kept playing dramatic music like something horrible and shocking was going to happen. But nothing ever did.I understand it's supposed to be about the Mary Kay Letourneau situation. Indicating it was an unhealthy relationship. And how older women can take unfair advantage of younger men.I thought technically it was done well. The acting was good. I like Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore. And Charles Melton got a lot of raves on his performance.But it seemed like this movie never went anywhere. I kept waiting for something to happen. But nothing ever did.I think viewers will enjoy this movie more, if they know --- going in --- it's supposed to represent the Mary Kay Letourneau situation. Otherwise like me, they may be left holding out their hands as if to ask, ""What was that supposed to be?"""
tt13651794,6.0,"Todd Haynes' 'May December' is not for everyone. I can easily imagine many viewers saying, 'What was that?' after its conclusion. In fact well before its conclusion. We've got a boatload of unlikable adult characters to deal with. A good many likable but confused adolescent poorly-drawn characters to deal with. And frankly we've got no one to root for.Even so, somehow the film 'worked' for me. There is a sensual tension that sits over the film from its start to finish. The story is that of an adult mother and wife (Julianne Moore) seducing a thirteen year old boy and as a result bearing three children. And this is only one aspect of the film's sensual / sexual tone. When twenty years later an actress (Natalie Portman) arrives in town (Savannah, Ga.) to learn more about the now-adult May-December couple (Portman's character is going to portray the mother in an upcoming film) that sense of sexual tension only increases, as did my interest in the story. The film's center concerns two characters; where little by little one of the two takes on the personality of the other.There are, however, several 'side-stories' most of which go nowhere. The May-December couples' children are graduating high school (So what?). A son born to the mother in her first marriage is a blackmailer (again, So what?). That same son alleges a same-sex affair with the seduced thirteen year old .. again this goes nowhere. And the actress; her relationship with an unseen film executive is vague, at best. Finally, the thirteen-year-old now a man in his thirties is having a crisis of sorts; though the details of this plot point are never really laid out.So, if the subject of a May-December affair interests you, you might well enjoy this film. Despite its problems.If not; I'd say, You can miss it."
tt8310486,5.0,"To be honest, it's my first watch and I'm writing this shortly after I left the cinema, so maybe not the most objective opinion, but definitely left with with mixed feelings(mostly bad ones). It couldn't succeed in engaging me enough in the story to develop any sort of feeling towards any of the characters. Despite of the talented cast(saving it in a way from a total crash after the first half) and ambitious, some would even say pretentious, beginnings, for me, it felt short in building a solid foundations, which could have been a mean of explanation for what happens in the end.But on the bright sight, it has a nice soundtrack(not sure it's always used well enough - which is also not so bright. Excuse me, had a bad day).Let's not be all critical. It has moments that have the capacity to intrigue you, but in overall I couldn't sense the integrity. Expected more of 80s erotic thrillers' vibe. Definitely not a thriller and on the erotic part, pretty sure I felt more interested in Winnie and Miller's wife than the Jenna Ortega's Cairo(which I guess wasn't the writer/director's initial intension.Some better examples from last year:
1.of peculiar teacher-student relationships - About Dry Grasses
2.of successful writer wife-unsuccessful writer husband - Anatomy of a FallPs- the smoke doesn't help to build mysteriousness."

It's good up until the end-which I didn't care for-where they left some things unanswered. Martin is a high school teacher that wanted to be a writer but only wrote one book until he decided to become a teacher. Jenna is one of his students that he gives special attention to, because she is smart, eager to learn and she is one of the few people that have read his book. Things get awkward between them when she wants to have a relationship with him but he refuses, saying it would be inappropriate. Things get even more awkward when Jenna threatens to tell other people about their relationship, whether it is real or not. Bashir plays a fellow teacher that tells Martin he had a similar problem with another student and should be very careful in how he handles things. Dagmara plays Martin's wife.It's rated R for language, smoking, drinking and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright to stream."
tt8310486,6.0,"I had high hopes. From the trailer it looked interesting and aesthetically pleasing but I was very wrong. Unfortunately by the end of the movie I was left feeling frustrated because, the main thing about this movie - the tension, it was non existent.There was no chemistry between the main protagonists. Zero. And Martin's heavy breathing in Jenna's face was very uncomfortable to watch...Jenna on the other hand... Oh God, where do I even start?? She was so stiff the whole time it was seriously hard to watch. I don't know when this movie was filmed, but she seems stuck in her ""Wednesday"" role. Yes, her character is supposed to be strong, opinionated, witty, charming, seductive... But she fails to deliver any of it! She doesn't seem like clever teenage girl suddenly shaken and intrigued by an unexpected new variable in her life, at times she kinda looks bored. Her narrating was good though. But like I mentioned, the main point of the movie, the taboo of the desire and magnetism between main characters, is absolutely lacking. It's almost cringe and uncomfortable watching their scenes of ""passion and attraction""...To sum it up - good idea, poorly executed. Shame."
tt8310486,6.0,"Millers Girl is one of those films which looks great on paper but falls short in real life. Such are the flaws in the story, script, dialog and direction that Freeman and Ortega, who both give flawless performances, are sucked into the empty void of the screenplay; and, the more faithful they are to their roles, the less interested the audience is in them. This kind of of filmic paradox allows secondary characters, like the one played by Bashir Salahuddin, to shine -- because the secondary roles are less defined, the actors have so more wiggle room to have fun with them. Ortega in particular clearly struggles to find something that shows Wednesday was not a fluke. She first appears onscreen with no makeup, thus establishing her character's essential innocence, but by the halfway mark she has become the femme fatale her fans expect. No surprise there. Bottom line: adequate fan service but misses the impact of Carey Milligan's award-winning AN EDUCATION (2009) by a country mile. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

I mean seriously? I thought we left this in the 2000s.Honestly save yourself a few hours of your time & watch something else instead. There are plenty sexual and romantic films that aren't as creepy.It's not often that I'm uncomfortable or weirded out by a movie (scene) and I think taboo tropes can be well executed without feeling like the creator gets off on it but this is definitely not one of them.As a teenage girl myself I kept inserting myself in the movie and ended up feeling grossed out.

The acting leaves a lot to be desired, and the dialog is pure corn, but it fills the ""guilty pleasure"" category like a glove.While others like Dirty Dancing, this movie will always define Patrick Swayze to me. In his memory, I will watch it over and over.It will be the movie that reminds me of how attractive Kelly Lynch is.It will remind me why I like Sam Elliott.It will remind me why Ben Gazzara is perfect as Boss Hogg.It's not art, it's pure entertainment, and why I will always remember Swayze.Besides, it has one of the best soundtracks around."
tt0098206,6.0,"""Road House"" tells the story of Dalton, a ""cooler"" who is hired by the owner of a small town dive bar in Jasper, MO. Dalton is hired to clean up the bar, as it has devolved into a very dangerous establishment. This place is so dangerous and rowdy that the house band plays behind a cage and the wait staff regularly engages in brawls with the patrons. This story used one of the common Western film tropes-- a new Sheriff is hired and brought in to clean up the town. That is essentially Dalton's role in this film. He's kind of the Gordon Ramsey of the bar scene. He's brought in to clean things up and kick out the riff raff. And boy is there a lot of riff raff to clean up.The conflict in ""Road House"" is that there is a gang, led by Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) whose entire MO it seems is to intimidate the local business people into giving them money and favors in exchange for not being beat up or having their businesses destroyed - an old fashioned protection racket if you follow the 1930s B films. Most of the town (including law enforcement!) is scared of Wesley and his gang and the group pretty much has full run of everything--including the bar where Dalton is hired. Wesley and his gang begin to resent Dalton's presence, because he isn't a pushover and isn't letting them have control.Much of the action of the film involves Dalton fighting Wesley and his gang of ruffians. Wade Garrett (Sam Elliott), Dalton's friend and mentor, who also works as a cooler at another club/bar, arrives in town to help out his friend. Together, Wade and Dalton try to take on Wesley. And of course, because this is Patrick Swayze, there is a love story intertwined, when he hooks up with his ER surgeon (Kelly Lynch).The bar scenes are crazy. A lot of nudity, fighting, violence, everything. The opening scene melee resembles the wild saloon fight in ""Dodge City"" or ""Blazing Saddles."" Jeff Healy plays the lead singer/guitarist of the house band, and they're fantastic. I especially loved their cover of The Doors' ""Roadhouse Blues.""Anyway. If you're adverse to movies with violence (including a particularly spectacular Rambo-esque turn for Swayze near the end of the film), nudity, and language, then this film isn't for you. But, if you're interested in a ridiculous trashy movie, with great music, then this is worth a watch."
tt13655120,5.0,"The premise of the movie is great, but some poor decisions in the script ruined the movie for me. This could've been a very good, Hitchcockian suspense thriller. Instead, they give away too much too soon, and make every action too predictable. There is some suspense, but it does not pervade the entire film; it is only intermittent. The characters are not very complex at all, and the viewer isn't very vested in any of them by the time things turn sour. As for the ending, I'm not sure what they were going for there.I was really expecting more from this movie, but left very disappointed. Not the worst I've seen this year, but it also could've been one of the best."
tt13655120,5.0,"I enjoyed the plot overall. It seemed realistic for the situation, wasn't overtly preachy on anything and had some crazy moments. The hardest part watching it was around how they depicted the space experience. The way the astronauts 'floated around' was very distracting for me. So much so that it definitely caused my review to drop a couple stars. The other aspects were just weird character moves and missed opportunities for some action. The floating was obviously done in a green screen harness and was just silly. I almost wished they would have just made up some gravity as a convenience instead of trying to make it seem like space floating. The other aspects were around the characters and how they responded. While I called it realistic, the characters behaved oddly in some of the interactions, felt like it was against the grain of their character at times. Maybe they tried to tackle too much, but for some reason this movie didn't really resonate with me and I would not recommend it to my friends. It was not horrible by any stretch and had good aspects, but it was just not that fun to watch."
tt13655120,6.0,"LIKES:The RunTime
-The movie clocks in at 90 minutes without credits, meaning it's not the monumental time investment
-It helps to an extent with the pacing, and gives a concise feeling that is refreshing given some of the bloated experiences.The Acting
-A strong cast for a very character focused movie, I quite enjoyed the crew and the psychological thriller that was assembled for this mission.-Gallagher is strong in the role cast, the neurotic personality, the composure, and the speech components solid for the part he was cast. Made for a very engaging character that tried to spice up a rather bland story.-Messina wasn't bad, his character holding some vim, vigor, and guts that I liked seeing come out in a few moments that called for it. Yet, I found his utilization missing a lot of, primarily in the latter half of the movie.-And for Debose, she was the star, holding the most evolution across the board, the scientist that has a story to tell and kind of tells it. More time was needed, but she was a stronger inclusion than most of the others.-The other three deserve a shout out for hitting their marks well. Each adding some small sliver that helps round out the cast, but again holding ore potential that a time extension could have helped.The Music Use
-This is no popular track set pumping out of the speakers or original songs that are going to be the next radio storm.-No, instead, it goes back to some of the classic elements the movies did, using it to establish so much of the mood of the shot.-I. S. S uses the symphony to help illicit the terror of the moment, sort of representing the very setting that we are in and adding that claustrophobic intensity to the movie.-Some psychological tones lace the violin work to bring something simple, yet so empowering in this film, and helping add to that experience. An art that seems lost, at least to this level.The Atmosphere
-Another major factor, the movie's cinematography is gorgeous and truly conveys the scope of the I. S. S. And the theatrics happening in this time frame.-Beautiful outside shots give you the grandiosity of the world below, and the circumstances below that hold this gorgeous effect that is terrifying and yet majestic at the same time.-Inside the station, the perspective changes so much, that it helps change the tone of the movie, evolving into something that you either will love or hate depending on how much you enjoy the start of the film.-But throughout it all, you get the emotions in the shot, feel every angle and action as the camera shifts and finds just the right spot and really capture the life in this station and then some.The Realism
-It's a Sci-Fi like movie that holds merit and less fantasy, which helps add to the theme of this movie.-I felt much of the movie was believable, giving the characters merit and helping add some more suspense and mystery to them.-And for a movie like this, keeping themselves grounded was, to some degree, worth it and I found it really helping connect so much for the Thrilling element that should appeal to these types of dramas.The Character Development, To Some Degree
-And some of the character testing held the potential for some of the best storytelling given what was going to be tested.-What starts as one goal, quickly escalates into about four types of moments that test their fortitude, willpower, loyalty, and more, all vying to win over the rest for the goal at hand.-That enigma of what will win was the driving force for me, alongside what the people would do and that was the thrilling part of the premise of this movie and what it had in store.-And yet... it might not have been fully reached (see below)DISLIKES:The Pacing
-The movie tries hard to compact a very loaded story into a short time span, and for me that led to inconsistent and often a disappointing pacing on my part.-Much of the movie is set up, elaborate additions to the movie testing that character fortitude and giving you a lot of dialogue, planning, and talking about their interests.-And then... nothing. Sure, the movie evolves to the typical tropes of the thriller element, but the payoff for the buildup didn't quite deliver, making the pacing now seem very much not the right pace for the 90 minutes we had to see.The Incomplete Feeling
-It leads to an ending that has merits that were good for me. Again, the music, the shots, and the acting enough to really help buffer this feeling with the ending.-Not enough though. I. S. S. Really left me feeling vague and ambiguous finale just feels like a cop out to an extent, much of the characters just losing connections with too soon and feeling that there was so much more to tell.-As such, the movie has that artistic flair that is beautiful and leaves that lingering feeling in my mind to reflect on. And yet, the fulfillment of the story being complete and not a setup is fleeting, as if drifting out into the void this movie takes place in.Lackluster
-Compared to the potentials of the trailer, the movie kind of felt dull and lackluster in the end.-Certainly, the morale studying and character building did the work, but so much of the movie felt very cut and dropped in favor of a rapid finish that just didn't hold the same majesty of space.-But when most of the shocking moments take place in the span of twenty minutes, nor do we have the full essay they seemed to want to take, the result just felt very moot and lacking the bite that I had sought.THE VERDICT:
For me, this film is beautiful on so many levels and again shows the talent of the director and his team to make space come alive, or space station. A fantastic collection of shots, CGI work, and editing really brings the emotions of the space station during this rather charged et of events. Acting brings out the taxation of the station, gives us characters that I wanted to explore and learn more about them as they take on these tests granted to them. Add in that musical element to enhance the factors, and this is an essay on the effects that Hollywood technology can place on you with the right guidance and use. Yet, the short runtime, while respectful for my personal life, doesn't do justice to fully deliver on all the buildup and promise of the movie. Such disappointing finishes left me feeling incomplete, with so much happening in about twenty minutes that the buildup did not feel worth the investment, when there was so much more to tell. Sure, there are these facets of moral testing and inner characters that are natural, realistic, and quite honestly that artistic soul that people like. And yet, I feel there was so much more that could have been done, that another half an hour or a mini-series could have taken given the amount they were putting in. My scores for the movie are:Sci-Fi/Thriller: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.5."
tt10545296,5.0,"My wife and I watched The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023) in theaters last night. The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment."
tt10545296,5.0,"No matter how faithful a movie is to the book, it can't save itself from the fact that it's unneeded. Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary."
tt10545296,5.0,"I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time."
tt10545296,5.0,"It's been some years since the franchise have us Mockingjay Part 2, my interest peaked at Catching Fire, but slowly diminished as it went on, I thought this looked recent from that trailer, for me though this was a bit of a damp squib, it wasn't bad, it just didn't hold my attention, a film I just couldn't get into.I had a feeling the film would struggle without Jennifer Lawrence, and it really did, I had no issues with Rachel Zegler's acting, indeed I thought the was rather good, but I couldn't attach to hers, or any of the characters, I just found them all a little anonymous, and almost impossible to empathise with.A mixed bag in terms of production, I thought some of the visuals were great, some terrific special effects, but all of that music, it just wasn't for me, I didn't quite see the appeal.Do yourself a favour, go and see Saltburn instead, an infinitely better film, I did thr double, that captivated me, this one sent me to sleep.5/10."
tt10545296,5.0,"""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is about as overlong as its title might suggest. It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth.Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition.The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader.He partakes as a ""mentor"" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war.The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor.The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV.She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality.The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels.5/10."
tt10545296,5.0,"If there's one popular franchise that I can't seem to like, it's the Hunger Games franchise. None of the films gave me something wonderful and so special that it left such an impression on me. This new release doesn't deviate much from that. It is again a very weak film that fails to develop a story in a captivating way. This actually occurs during the middle of the film, where most of the action scenes take place. The film as a whole always seems to drag on, but part 2 is much better than the rest precisely because it escapes this tiring pace that doesn't go anywhere. Part 3 is where it gets even more tiring. The film always seems to be coming to an end, but it never ends. The beginning and middle seem not to be connected with the end. It feels like you're watching two movies and it ends up being even more unbearable. There are many problems in the development of the story as a whole, especially those of some important characters. It's a mediocre film that doesn't deviate from the franchise's standards. It's not the worst, it's not the best. It is a film that becomes forgettable."
tt5715874,5.0,"What a strange filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos is. Had I not already seen ""The Lobster"" (2015) (and have since seen two of his earlier Greek productions), I probably would've been completely taken aback by this one, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer."" Like its predecessor, its characters seem to occupy some alternate reality entirely dominated by egocentrism, deviant sex and magical retaliatory justice. Again, the acting is intentionally stilted, and there seem to be archaic literary references. I found the eye-for-an-eye pun of ""The Lobster"" amusing, but the source of Ancient-to-Classical Greek mythology here is quite a treat for me. At university, I took a class, not unlike the daughter in this movie, that included reading the play ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" by Euripides and, then, viewing the 1977 film adaptation ""Iphigenia"" directed by Mihalis Kakogiannis. Unfortunately, the result in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is rather muddled.In the Greek myth, King Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter, Iphigenia, at the behest of the goddess Artemis to allow him and his troops to proceed on the warpath to fight the Trojans. In some versions, Iphigenia is replaced by a deer, hence the title of this movie. The reason I don't think the effects work as well here as they did in ""The Lobster"" is because whereas that movie took human shortcomings to absurd extremes, this one takes what was already by modern standards an absurd myth and attempts to make it modern and more ordinary. Gods are dead and replaced by doctors, and if there is a god, apparently, he's a pockmarked teenager seeking revenge for his dead father. I suppose a surgeon's wife role playing during sex as a patient under general anesthesia and a father recalling to his son the time he masturbated his father is more in line with some of the sexual perversity one finds in some Classical Greek literature, though. Yet, overall, it comes across as disjointed. If this were supposed to be a psychological thriller, it seems difficult to lure the spectator in without being able to identify with the characters--whereas this was unnecessary in the black comedy of ""The Lobster"" (and contradictory to the intent of the Greek movies). But, the stilted acting and illogical premise of the narrative works against identification. I don't think any amount of tense scoring and camera movement from distant perspectives can alleviate that--in a world where nothing is sacred.P.S. I still don't quite get the point of ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) as the film-within-the-film. Is it just because characters in both are prisoners of fate or something? I prefer the self-reflexivity of the director's prior ""Dogtooth"" (2009) and ""Alps"" (2011)."

He is befriended by Martin (Barry Keoghan) who is the son of his dead patient. Martin insinuates himself into Steven's family and Kim falls for him. Martin reveals his threatening predictions with a devastating solution.After his interesting weird The Lobster, Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos creates another oddity. His insistence on the mannered monotone dialogue delivery has a hypnotic effect that puts me to sleep. I had to rewind to get back into the flow. Keoghan's dead-eye serial killer performance is too obvious. I can't believe that Steven would bring him into his home. While I appreciate a lot of the outsider oddity flavor, I cannot take any reality from any of the characters or situation. The first thought I have as Steven is that the boy poisoned my family. At a certain point, these are no longer realistic people but rather artistic installations. There is some value in the artwork and I can imagine this story as a shocking psychological thriller in another person's hands."
tt5715874,6.0,"Ahh, so this is the same director that brought us ""The Lobster""; somehow I'm not surprised. I read a few dozen reviews of the movie posted here on IMDb, and of course a lot of them state how absurd the story is. Of those that commented favorably however, they seemed to attach some credibility to the events that occurred in the picture. That's where my criticism of the film actually lies. First off, it's undeniable that the film starts out with an oddly creepy vibe. The relationship between Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) and Martin (Barry Keoghan) is shrouded in some kind of mystery that the viewer is not privy to. My own sense was that there was an aberrant sexual relationship between the two with all the various allusions made by the characters, like meeting in secret and the gifts bestowed on Martin by the esteemed cardiac surgeon.But when we come to learn that this is a revenge tale on the part of the young teen who's father died on Murphy's operating table, any attempt to decipher reality from what's going on goes astray. The main question one must ask is how Martin was perpetrating the illness that was about to decimate the Murphy family. I came up with two possibilities - poison or voodoo magic. The poison angle was immediately set aside by the various experts called in to diagnose Murphy's son Bob (Sunny Suljic), who was exhibiting the symptoms Martin warned Steven about. As for the voodoo magic, well, I'll let the reader make up his own mind on that.Perhaps we have to take Martin's own advice at the moment he took a chunk out of his own arm while detained in the Murphy basement. He stated to Steven, ""Do you understand? It's metaphorical"". Which then puts it in context with the Greek tragedy aspects that other reviewers have commented on of which I have no knowledge. Following a perverse instance of Russian roulette performed by Murphy against the members of his own family, the revenge goal attained, some semblance of normality is restored and the remaining Murphy's are allowed to forge ahead with their existence. The diner scene at the finale offered an opportunity for some sort of confrontation that wasn't going to happen. The trace of a smile by daughter Kim (Raffey Cassidy) appeared to be well out of context with the situation given her willingness to sacrifice herself for the rest of the family.So what's the message here? Darned if I know and I'll be darned if you know either. I generally go for symbolism in film, but it's tough to find anything of value here. Maybe it is metaphorical, but of what, I really couldn't say."
tt29538571,6.0,"Genre films generally have a very difficult time in German-speaking cinema. And when it comes to action films in particular, German filmmaking lags far behind. I personally can only remember the humorous MMA hit PLAN B (2016) by Ufuk GENC with the superb stuntman Can AYDIN, which at least made people sit up and take notice that this genre is also possible in German-speaking countries. It's a good thing that the global streaming service NETFLIX definitely has a taste for unusual experiments. And lo and behold, successful director Oliver KIENLE (BAD BANKS) lets a remarkably well-trained Emilio SAKRAYA, like Franka POTENTE as Lola, run through Berlin against the merciless passage of time. Why this action occurs plays only a minor role. The only important thing is that Emilio SAKRAYA's Octavio is in a perceived emergency and therefore has to beat up half of the gangster world in the German capital. After all, why does he have his impressive MMA skills?There's never a dull moment in this stylish, non-stop film, but you won't find any special flashes of inspiration in the script. But that's not a bad thing either. The film is a vehicle through which Emilio SAKRAYA can recommend himself for further roles in international action cinema. In addition to all the fighting, he can also play.Dennis MOJEN and the internationally booked stunt people Marie MOUROUM and Bruno SALGUEIRO also appear in other roles. Otherwise, the other stunt people probably come mainly from Hungary. Oh yes, a very cute kitten named Onion steals the show from the hardened whipping boy.Even if the film will certainly not become a classic of the genre, it is definitely good that German filmmakers are finally tackling such genres that are popular with global audiences. Keep it up!"
tt29538571,5.0,"I get it that the action movies aren't known for their story or logic, yet I recently caught this flick on Netflix, and I believe this one takes the recent lead as the stupidest action movie of recent times.For example the plot revolves around semi poor MMA fighter\gym owner who suppose to do a fight which will bring him a lot of money, yet decides to quit to get to his daughter birthday because his ex decided she'd sue him for sole custody because he's no show. The whole movie happens during 60 minutes period of time.He decides to run away (literally by foot), though eventually he loses everything and on the way fights his opponent anyway.Aside from numerous plot problems that are ridiculous at best, the thing that caught my eye was the main lead's earbuds. There is literally zero chance they'd stay inside his ears entire time through his fighting sequences. It's a small detail, but it's been a problem for me for a long time.The fighting scenes are decent and that's the only reason I gave this movie 5/10.Considering everything, I guess this movie can work if you're under the influence and are looking for some mindless action flick."
tt29538571,5.0,"It was fun to watch this movie because of those nice fighting scenes. But there were a lot of problems with plot and continuity.First, it was a stupid idea to talk on the phone just before a cage fight. Pros don't do that.Second, presenting the woman as a big problem is the point i will not get.Third, how is it possible that usual mafia guys can take so mich damage and can still involve in fights again and again?Fourth and the worst, by the way i did not see this in the reviews, day and night problem. So as we see in the movie, Berlin can jump from afternoon sun to midnight darkness in sixty minutes? And it's frim 17.00 to 18.00?And finally, who the heck is that lawyer?"
tt29538571,5.0,"This movie was ridiculous. But i of course watched it for the eye candy that is Emilio Sakraya. Be warned however that the plot of this movie is completely absurd!The movie centers around a young man who has 60 minutes to get to his daughter's birthday party or he loses custody of her. The problem is ...he also has a fight event.Due to his dilemma he bails on his match and it almost seems counter productive for him not to go through with it??? When he actually could have just done and gotten his actual match over with and plenty of time to spare to take a relaxing uber ride to his daughter's birthday??? Also what kinda asshole tells her kid's father that he is gonna lose custody of his only child that he clearly loves and who loves him back within an hour? Ok fine.But alas...there would be no movie if things actually made sense. Youre gonna have to suspend your disbelief while watching this.Anyways, he ends up destroying everyone and everything in his path in a quick and efficient way (once again proving if he hadnt bailed on the fight he couldve had his opponent on the ground within minutes with plenty of time to spare and take a shower, change clothes, do a photo op, save his gym and not lose custody of his daughter.) But okay.The point of this movie is really and clearly the martial arts, the fights scenes were great and entertaining honestly...so for that im giving it a passable rating, clearly the lead character put in a lot of work into it and it shows!"

The title says it all, it's all about and on the basis of this, the Netflix production at least manages to be an entertaining film that is easy to watch. John Wick 4 was watched as a warm-up for the probably watched more than once as a warm-up for filming, and probably again during, I'm just saying the scene in the club. Of course, this film is leagues below leagues below the great role models in all areas, but in the B-area it should certainly a good place in the B section.

tt22041854,5.0,"It is 1949, and American teenager Priscilla Beaulieu is in Germany with her parents. At a party one night, she meets Elvis Presley, who is stationed in the same military base as her father. The King is drawn to her, while she is smitten by his down-to-earth charm and seemingly genuine humanity. As time goes on, the two forge a relationship, and by 1963, she is living with him in Memphis. However, being The King's wife proves more difficult than she imagined, and far more lonesome.Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, and based on 'Elvis and Me' by Priscilla Presley and Sandra Harmon, 'Priscilla' is a visually evocative drama both striking and flawed. Firstly, the title is something of a misnomer, as this is not the story of Priscilla Presley's life, rather an overview of the years she spent with Elvis (one wonders why the source material's title was not retained). The narrative focuses on her growing isolation, trapped in Graceland, at the beck and call of her controlling husband. However, due to Coppola's cold approach to the themes of agency and control, her examination of same leaves one oddly unmoved.Moreover, despite the fact that she is ostensibly the central character, we aren't offered insight into Priscilla's motivations, or aspirations, nor does she have much of a personality. She is a soft-spoken, kind-hearted girl at the beginning and- for all intents and purposes- the very same at the end. Coppola's dialogue lacks wit, while Sarah Flack's ponderous editing leaves proceedings feeling lethargic- all the more so due to the dearth of characterisation and dialogue therein.Some critics are quick to state that the film is purposefully superficial, that Coppola is interested only in the surface level. By focusing on the skin, as it were, and not the heart beneath, she re-enforces the idea that everything in Elvis's life was an easily purchasable object, even Priscilla. However, as the title would suggest, this is not meant to be a movie about Elvis. Therefore, the scant character development or depth with regard to Priscilla is alienating. We don't have much reason to root for her, except as a result of the obvious distaste engendered by Elvis's mood swings and controlling behaviour.As a result, the audience feels detached from proceedings, disconnected from the characters both emotionally and psychologically. Although Coppola creates a more human version of The King than viewers saw in Baz Luhrman's 'Elvis' or Liza Johnson's 'Elvis & Nixon', by demythologizing and bringing him down to earth, much of his charisma is diluted. The film's version of the man is a brooding, volatile control freak, without much magnetism or charm. Furthermore, secondary characters are barely more than shadows in darkness; you can hardly make them out at all.Conversely, Coppola - and frequent collaborator Philippe Le Sourd's - cinematography is stunning. Their composition makes Priscilla appear small and out of place compared to Elvis, like a China doll discarded in a playground. Their use of juxtaposing colours adds to the luxury of Graceland, as well as to Priscilla's isolation, while the soft lighting throughout lends the film an air of romance and intimacy. Everything in the film drips with textural richness, immersing the viewer in a lavish, decadent world, where every surface glistens with silk, velvet and gold.In addition, Stacey Battat's costume design contributes to the personalities of the characters astutely (perhaps more so than Coppola's screenwriting), heightening the visual contrast between Elvis and Priscilla. Her costume, makeup and hairstyle changes, in particular, mirror her evolution from a shy girl to an independent woman- even if Coppola's screenplay doesn't detail that journey; Priscilla's varying appearance does. Additionally, Tamara Deverell's intricate production design- as well as the set decoration from Patricia Cuccia- lends the film authenticity and realism.Moreover, the soundtrack is stirring, utilising both modern and period pieces. Although Elvis's estate refused permission for any of his songs to be used, Coppola makes excellent use of tracks by the likes of Dolly Parton and The Ronettes, bolstering the narrative's themes. Contemporary music is interwoven cleverly into proceedings, never feeling as jarring and out of place as it does in the aforementioned Luhrman's efforts, complementing things nicely.Cailee Spaeny stars as Priscilla, opposite Jacob Elordi as Elvis. Spaeny displays Priscilla's innocence subtly, being nuanced and understated. Although there really isn't much for her to work with, she overcomes the limited characterisation of the role, while handling dull dialogue with ease. Similarly, Elordi makes Coppola's angsty, moody version of Elvis an interesting, multifaceted character. He might not really look like The King, but he shares a good chemistry with Spaeny. Unfortunately, a parade of supporting actors- notably Dagmara Dominczyk and Ari Cohen as Priscilla's parents- are largely wasted, given little to do.In conclusion, Sofia Coppola's 'Priscilla' is trying to say some interesting things about fame, agency and control, but never gets around to saying them. Coppola's narrative is too cold and calculated, while her characterisation and dialogue are too minimalist to make much impact. Conversely, the cinematography and production design are striking, while the stirring score complements proceedings cleverly. Cailee Spaeny does fine work as the titular character, as does her co-star Jacob Elordi as Elvis. Although it has its moments, it's a moody blue film that suspicious minds might want to return to sender."
tt22041854,6.0,"Before Elvis Presley's daughter Lisa Marie passed away earlier this year, she was quite contemptuous over Sofia Coppola's portrayal of her parents in her biographical feature Priscilla. Based on Priscilla Presley's 1985 memoir Elvis and Me, the film has nonetheless garnered mostly positive reviews and even earned Cailee Spaeny the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 2023 Venice Film Festival. Given that Priscilla herself was an executive producer on this project, it's best to look at this project at a more earnest portrayal of Elvis and Priscilla instead of it being romanticized or sugar coated.Now as this film depicts the courtship between a then 14 year old Priscilla and a then 24 year old Elvis, the biggest takeaway from this feature is that it's supposed to comment more on the idea of love being difficult to obtain as the wife of a global superstar. While it does depict a taboo romantic subject in mind, it becomes far more toxic when Elvis proves to be far more manipulative and abusive than his rockstar persona claims otherwise. Cailee Spaeny and Jacob Elordi share quite a conflicting bond as their depictions show a more disturbing underbelly to what the public thought of the Presleys otherwise. Coppola makes sure to emphasize the unfortunate implications behind their relationship without directly endorsing it, especially as we can see how much the spousal torment and jadedness behind the life of fame creates more misery in Priscilla than to the people worried for her like her parents and socialites. Behind all the rock & roll, glamour and pizazz lies a hollow marriage where one is no longer illusioned to much of anything, be it romance or appreciation for the music.That being said, outside of the disturbing implications behind Priscilla and Elvis' courtship, there really isn't much else to take away from the movie. By putting so much of Priscilla's perspective into the limelight, the portrayal of her husband isn't interesting enough to dissect beyond him being a fake charming guy who more so likes the idea of a soul mate instead of actually being with one consistently. It doesn't help that the film rushes certain plot points just to get to Presley's life of prestige, such as Priscilla's time with her rightfully concerned family, her trouble focusing in school and even the implied drug addictions she and her husband faced. Despite that latter key point playing a big role in Elvis' abusive behavior, it isn't explored enough to leave much of a dramatic impact. In fact, for a film that tries to incorporate themes of domestic abuse, it feels surprisingly lacking in showing much of that tension. Also, once the film ends, it feels as if it missed the opportunity to go more into Priscilla's life after leaving Elvis for good, almost as if it felt it didn't need to tell more when it should have.Outside of those qualities, the filmmaking is competent enough yet never rises above decently well crafted in depicting the era of subject. The cultural aesthetic of the late 50s and early to mid 60s feels more tact on for the sake of the time period, as outside of some of the road shows and projects Elvis is apart of, only the costuming sticks out the most, and yet the film hardly does much with them to make much of an impression. If anything, the pop cultural influence from this era feels more like an accompaniment to the story than really playing much of a role beyond the media playing up Elvis' life as more than it really is. Also, the lack of much of a background score surprisingly doesn't work as most of the scenes play out with an awkward tension that would have benefited from more than just what's on the soundtrack. Speaking of which, for some reason there are all kinds of retro and contemporary rock and jazz songs except from the king himself. Perhaps given the involvement of Priscilla Presley and her ex-husband's enterprises, this comes off as understandable yet confusing.So while made with earnest intentions and captivating performances, Priscilla is a decent enough biopic that falls flat in exploring more about its subject matter beyond superficial love and all the glitz and glamour that comes with it. I would recommend this on the grounds that it's more interesting than it is thought provoking, though definitely take that for what it's worth given how much influence was done by the target at hand. Besides, even if the king is no longer looked at the same way he was then, projects like these are good reminders to not look up to everyone you admire, let alone fall for."
tt22041854,6.0,"Just rather uninteresting, on film terms at least.It is interesting seeing the film portray a different type of version of Elvis Presley, one that is uncomfortable to watch unfold but one that ought to be told. That's where anything noteworthy I have to say about this release ends, though. As a movie, it's rather boring. I'm not convinced there's enough to be told across a full blown picture, at least not one around 1hr 45mins in length. I will say that Cailee Spaeny puts in a solid display as the titular character, in fairness.Jacob Elordi as Elvis, in my opinion, isn't a positive to be honest. If I didn't know he was playing Elvis I genuinely wouldn't have guessed he was playing the singer, aside from a few outfits and the twisty bit of hair in his fringe. Accent particularly seemed off to me too, Elordi amusingly (given the director's connection) sounds more like Nicolas Cage (c. 1997, 'Con Air', Cameron Poe) on phone call scenes.It's competently put together visually at least, though overall I can't honestly say this made a mark on me personally. I don't feel like I learnt anything about 'Priscilla' herself. I doubt I'll remember this one long term, sadly."
tt22041854,6.0,"Based on the book written by Priscilla Presley, it tells her story right from a 9th grade student being smitten by Elvis and hopelessly falling in love with him. Then Priscilla, leaves her life behind to be part of Elvis's life and live it the way he wants her to. The cheating, mistreatment and complete disregard for her feeling eventually pushes her to realize that she has her own identity and it is not worth living somebody else's life. The film documents their life together till their divorce.Having watched Elvis the movie and totally enjoying it to the core, it was hard to buy into this Bad Elvis. Thanks to the performances especially by Cailee Spaeny, I was able to stay with the narrative till the end. This had a serious narrative and it wasn't an easy watch. As it only documents the years from the moment Priscilla meets Elvis and them living together, only to end up in a marriage which parts them enough to give Priscilla enough courage to seek divorce.Once again it was a powerful performance by Cailee and kudos to Sofia Coppola to get such a performance from her and to have that control over the narrative, which successfully portrays the emotional journey of Priscilla. From being a naive teen who is hopelessly in love, despite being ill treated to finally grow up enough to figure out what needs to be done. The pace is slow and like I said, it is not an easy watch."
tt22041854,5.0,"One cannot help comparing this movie with
"" Elvis"" of 2022 which was on the same subject and which was far superior in all aspects. This one is about the gaps in the marital relationship between Elvis and Priscilla and not just about Priscilla alone. It could have been called "" Elvis and Priscilla "" instead. First the negative aspects. Nothing in the movie looks or sound real not the love or emotions or feelings. The narrative is too laid back, the dialogues are uninspiring and nothing dramatic or interesting really happens most of the time. The casting of Jacob Elordi as Elvis doesn't appear to be the best one. For one he is too tall and awkward in his dialogue delivery. For a singer, it is intriguing that he mumbles his way through most of the time. I wonder why he was directed to perform that way. The other characters are also on a low profile too. There is mention colonel at times. It is difficult to imagine an Elvis movie without his songs and this movie is exactly that.( I understand there were issues relating to permission to use.) What is actually the saving grace is the fairly good direction by Sofia Cuppola and the appealing acting of Cailee Spaeny in the title role. Both ladies have contributed to lift the movie a bit."
tt22041854,5.0,"Priscilla (2023) :
Movie Review -Priscilla Review: Last year, we had Elvis Presley's biographical ""Elvis,"" and now we have his wife, Priscilla Ann Presley's biopic ""Priscilla."" Has a thing like this ever happened before? I mean, husband and wife having individual biopics in such a quick time? Certainly no. To be frank, Elvis was a legendary figure in his field, and he lived a very controversial life, so he kind of made a perfect filmy script. The point is that he deserved that biopic. Now, can I say the same for Priscilla? After watching Priscilla, my answer should be ""NO"". Yet, this film can be watched once for Cailee Spaeny's beautiful portrayal of Priscilla Presley and Jacob Elordi's classy accent of Elvis Presley-not looks.In the late 50s, 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu (Cailee Spaeny) is residing in Germany as her father is stationed in the military. At a party, she meets Elvis (Jacob Elordi) for the first time. After a silent first meeting, Elvis finds Priscilla attractive and calls her for a date. They both begin seeing each other, while Pris' parents keep complaining about the same. Priscilla keeps getting insulted and humiliated in this relationship and yet carries it forward. Presley's affairs and personal political frustration are clearly visible, but every time he successfully manages to convince Priscilla to come back to him. They both marry despite the age gap, and then Priscilla begins sensing the isolation and compartmentalization, which leads the way to the rest of the plot, but there is hardly anything that deserves to be comprehended.Sofia Coppola's script doesn't really hold you much in its grip, and the screenplay is very slow. When a 110-minute film feels slow, believe me, there is something wrong with it. It's maybe because Priscilla's life wasn't full of headlines. She kept fighting herself and was never able to bring it on her external appearance. Maybe because she was paired with the man who had a publicly exposed image and somewhere she felt that pressure. The scenes like high school gossip, the graduation ceremony, Elvish's departure for the military, and that family photoshoot have given a pretty good idea of the self-complexity of Priscilla. After all, she was married to a superstar, and nobody can deny that fact. She had to battle that fact, and then she had a baby to carry his blood forward. There is nothing dramatic about the whole marriage life, and that's why this movie fails to entertain you and keep you hooked.The biggest plus point of the film is Cailee Spaeny's dedicated performance. She looked like Priscilla, that's one thing, but she was able to bring that persona on screen without saying much. Sometimes silence speaks louder than words, they say, and here is one of the situations where it fits right. Cailee's gorgeous face will take your heart away, for sure. Jacob Elordi has done tremendously well when it comes to Elvis' accent and body language, but man, don't ask if he looked like Presley. He was looking more like Austin Butler than Elvis Presley, and the fun part is that Butler looked exactly like Elvis in Elvis. This was a big mismatch, but not as a performer, but as a lookalike. Ari Cohen and Dagmara Dominczyk have a few scenes here and there, and like most of the supporting cast, they go unnoticed. Now, do I have to mention the supporting cast separately?Getting an original motion picture soundtrack for Priscilla was a challenging call, and the team deserves to be hailed for that. Some of the tunes do feel nostalgic, especially with the visuals featuring mainly Elvis and Priscilla. The art design and production design are fine. Philippe Le Sourd's cinematography is okay, while Sarah Flack's editing lacks sharpness. Sofia made one big mistake with the film: she gave a lot of importance and screen space to Elvis. The film was Priscilla's biopic, but it is presented as her marriage life, hence making Elvis the hero. Somehow, he overtook the space, and the main character got into a competition, which shouldn't have happened. Of course, Elvis' character was damn important, but he was never the main character. He was always supposed to be the second-main character. Sofia felt more interested in glorifying Elvis' wrongdoing, and Priscilla was a poor little girl. That was part of the process to create sympathy for her character, but you end up feeling pity for her. Even in the last frame, when she is leaving Elvis at once, Sofia has to show Elvis' fans cheering for him. With some mistakes like this here and there throughout the film, Sophia Coppola's Priscilla seems stained and a pretty average flick. To keep you awake, there are a lot of steamy smooching scenes, so make sure you don't miss them.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest."
tt22041854,6.0,"Wow, this was an uncomfortable movie to watch. Priscilla invites inevitable comparisons to last year's ""Elvis,"" portraying an exact opposite narrative. Helmed by the talented Sophia Coppola, who commands great respect, and featuring Jacob Elordi, an actor I admire, the film falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, it presents a one-dimensional, flat perspective that left me somewhat disappointed.While the performances are strong, and the direction commendable, Priscilla's narrative feels tedious and slow at times. The harrowing depiction of power imbalances in the central relationship adds a layer of discomfort that makes the film hard to watch. Sophia Coppola's artistic choices unveil a side of the characters that, while impactful, renders the viewing experience challenging. Priscilla sheds light on the vulnerability of a young protagonist, emphasizing the discomfort of witnessing a story where she is just a child."
tt22041854,6.0,"The movie fails to provide a closer look at the real Priscilla -- most of the movie's portrayal is already known to the world-wide Elvis audiences. Worse is that it portrays Elvis in such a negative light -- again, much of which; the drug addiction and its obvious ills, the audience already knows. The actors did what they could to this uninspiring script, especially Elordi but it was really the visuals that were, if anything, at all interesting and beautiful. That said, I could not get past the height difference between the key actors which was an obvious mismatch nor a more in-depth understanding of the main character herself. As I drove home from the theatre I just kept asking myself, ""But...why? Why make this movie?"" What good comes from it? For me, the portrayal did no good to Priscilla necessarily; as mentioned it taught little of her; her parents or their parenting, it lacked an emotional fullness to the real life story of this romance (if you will), and other than the bedroom scenes, very little of Priscilla's thinking, the relationship of Elvis and she. Lastly, and importantly, it does little good to the real-life extended Presley family, not to mention, the legacy of Elvis."
tt22041854,5.0,"Based on her one-dimensional book Elvis and Me, the movie is a superficial chronicle of minutiae in the life of a naive girl, blinded by phony illusions of glamour, longing for affection from a child-man who never grew up, and trapped behind closed doors of toxic fame from Hollywood to Graceland.Instead of a flowing narrative, it's a series of scenes, the worst and best parts of their 13-year relationship, and doesn't come together well enough to feel like a complete story. This combined with the lack of Coppola's vibrant, feminine, and electric aesthetic makes Priscilla a major disappointment from a true cinematic visionary achievement.My Rating : 5/10."

He's the only director with two films in my all-time top 10 list (""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dogville""), so needless to say, I'll watch anything he does.2. Willem Dafoe.3. Charlotte Gainsbourg.4. The Prologue and the first two chapters in the film: the first half or so is an intriguing psychological horror about a couple trying to cope with the grief of losing their toddler son. The film is told in a prologue, Chapter I: Grief, Ch. II: Pain (Chaos Reigns), Ch. III: Despair, Ch. IV: The Three Beggars, and an epilogue.5. By the end of chapter II, when a fox stares at Willem Dafoe and says ""Chaos reigns"" (which inadvertently made lots of spectators laugh), you will either see this as a ridiculous scene, not take the film seriously, perhaps even walk out; or see it as Lars winking at the audience, as if saying ""If you think this is funny, you have no idea what's coming next"" - and stay for the rest of the ride. That will determine whether or not this is the film for you.NOT SEE:1. A different film starts at Chapter III: an extremely gory, absurdly series of graphic scenes made purely for shock factor. While ""Dogville"" was and still is the most disturbing film I've ever seen (but also brilliant and psychologically stimulating), Antichrist is easily the most sickening.2. A scene where a penis (Willem Dafoe's character, but certainly a body double's) literally ejaculates blood - is simply something I wish I could erase from my memory.3. Charlotte Gainsbourg, whose organic, earthy beauty and fearlessness (her parents are Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, damn it!) fits the part very well (and even won the Best Actress prize at Cannes this year for her performance, a trend among Von Trier's female stars, who always deliver strong, memorable performances, although he is constantly accused of being misogynistic), is usually a pleasure to watch. But to see her cutting her own clit with scissors is inexcusable. By the time that happened, I had half of my face covered.4. More mutilation per square feet than virtually any slasher movie you'll encounter. Personally, I don't think that's even necessary.5. Dedicated to the Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky, this is a film that, love it or hate it, certainly is impossible to be indifferent to - which also could, and perhaps even should, be an argument to whether one should see it or not. However, in my not so humble opinion, Antichrist is so uncomfortable and disturbing for all the wrong reasons - which doesn't mean I won't keep watching Von Trier's films (bring us ""Wasington"", the conclusion to the ""USA - Land of Opportunities"" trilogy already - it's been a long wait!)."

Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
tt13560574,5.0,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors."

tt13560574,5.0,I can't with movies full of characters that just walk around without any instinct doing the absolute dumbest things they could possibly choose before they're murdered. It's literally the whole movie. The 'action and gore' is actually pretty tame. The sex is explicit. The characters are idiots.
tt1462764,6.0,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is on my top 10 list of all-time favorite movie. I did not feel that ""Dial of Destiny"" gave a proper send off to the francise. It seemed like the first half of the movie is nothing but over the top chase scenes about trying to get possession of the Dial. That first half does not invest time to plant motivation so the viewer will even care about the Dial and who gets possession of it. Also, the Helena character is pretty unlikeable. Her passion is in the wrong place. Indiana is at odds with Helena for most of the movie. They do not make a good team. And then Indiana is a deflated version of Indiana that is kind of depressing. And to top it all off, there is no sense of fun and comedy in the movie. I hope writers have not forgotten how to write a good adventure story. ""Dial of Destiny"" misses the mark on many levels. And it kind of bothered me how much unnecessary killing there was in the movie. That is not family friendly. I wanted to really like ""Dial of Destiny"", but as the movie was progressing, I had to admit the movie was just not working."
tt1462764,6.0,"It is 1944 and adventuring archaeologist Indiana Jones is in a familiar predicament: the Nazis have caught him attempting to scupper their nefarious plans. After breaking free of their vile clutches, Jones and his accomplice Basil Shaw discover the fascists have found the Antikythera mechanism, a device created by Archimedes that supposedly reveals time fissures. Jones escapes, foils the enemy's schemes and steals the mechanism- seemingly putting the matter to bed. Some 25 years later, however, Jones is thrust back into action when his goddaughter Helena comes looking for the Antikythera; with an underground group of die-hard Nazis on her tail. Will Jones and Helena manage to save the day before time runs out?Directed by James Mangold and written alongside Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and David Koepp, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is an uneven sendoff to one of the greatest characters in film history, that all too often feels like it came from the 'paint by numbers' school of filmmaking. Mangold tries throughout to recapture the magic of the original trilogy of Jones pictures, and occasionally succeeds; such as in the thrilling opening set in 1944, or a touching reunion between Indy and his estranged love at the end of the film. Furthermore, it is consistently enjoyable watching Harrison Ford on screen as Indy once more, even if he is a more downcast fellow this time; and the odd reference to adventures past is sure to make fans of the series grin from ear to ear.However, the narrative is weak, the characterization of secondary characters is scant at best and- weirdly- at times it seems as if Indy is the sidekick in his own film. Helena Shaw, from the moment she comes on screen, is treated as the real star of the show, despite her being a decidedly unlikable lady. A spoiled and arrogant heiress, she is constantly rude and dismissive of Indy, when she isn't being reckless and impulsive, putting herself and others in danger for her own selfish motives. As written, the character has little to no respect for history or culture, seeing everything as a means to an end. She contrasts starkly with Indy, whose humble respect for his profession and legacy endears him to audiences. Helena, on the other hand, is a self-centered cad, who tries to upstage our hero at every turn. Why Mangold thought she should be made the (arguable) central character when this is Indy's last outing is beyond comprehension, not to mention being irritating and disrespectful to a cinematic legend.Alas, Mangold's poor characterization isn't confined to her alone. 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' not only provides us with a discount Short Round in the form of Helena's associate Teddy- a kid more irritating than mischievous- but a discount Major Toht too, in the form of Professor Voller- a Nazi scientist so generic even the incomparable Mads Mikkelsen can't make him interesting. Neither of these new iterations of old characters are very compelling, nor well rounded; and their inclusion in the film feels like a desperate attempt to out-do and re-create times gone by. Furthermore, the few familiar faces that occasionally pop up feel shoehorned into the plot, and Voller's troupe of henchmen are bland and forgettable.Unfortunately, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' contains underwhelming visuals as well, which look cheap compared to the likes of 'Raiders' or 'The Last Crusade.' Much like with the previous 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', there is a phony digital sheen to everything on screen that takes one out of the movie completely, and the questionable CGI is jarring throughout. Comparing the first three movies with the last two, it seems digital processes don't fit an Indiana Jones vehicle, they are the kind of epics that demand to be shot on film with practical effects. Moreover, the exaggerated effects and artificiality of proceedings hamper whatever realism Mangold was trying to foster with his downbeat narrative and allusions to real world history.The main problem with 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' though, is its lack of originality or charm, which the previous films- well, the first three, anyway- had in spades. Mangold seems content to rely on recycled tropes and clichés to forward the story, making this adventure feel like familiar ground instead of fresh fun. The film uses the similar formula of Nazis, ancient artifacts, exotic locations and supernatural elements that we have seen before, but without the wit, creativity and excitement that made them memorable; meaning this iteration of Indy comes as more of a whimper than a bang.Are there some elements deserving of praise in the film? Of course. Harrison Ford is consistently excellent and engaging as Indy, carrying the adventure squarely on his shoulders with his usual ease and charm. Furthermore, John Williams' epic score is stirring and- though her character is unlikable- Phoebe Waller-Bridge brings a nice blend of snark and enthusiasm to proceedings, sharing a good chemistry with Ford. Had they a better script to work with- and if Mangold's characterization wasn't so one-dimensional- they might have made a memorable duo. Additionally, the action is generally well realized- though tends towards the overblown- and there are moments and batches of dialogue that'll have fans of the series entertained, even if they are a bit few and far between.However, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' just isn't great. As an adventure movie, it is too downbeat, and as a final entry in a fantastic series, it is too weak narratively to make much impact. Though it makes for a better overall package than 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,' it's not by much. The character of Helena Shaw is hard to warm to, the villains are forgettable and the visuals are underwhelming. In short, Indy, Ford and the fans deserved a better movie than 'The Dial of Destiny,' a muddled misadventure proving that time waits for no man; not even Indiana Jones."
tt1462764,6.0,"I mean Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) may have had its flaws, but still had a sense of fun to it, like an Indiana Jones movie should. There was very little of that here.1969 Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is quite bitter, is about to retire has a college professor and his marriage to Marion is ending, but his feeling for adventure comes back. When his goddaughter named Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) comes to him about a special device that could change the course of history.Some actions are pretty good, Harrison Ford is great has Indy, showing his old age catching up with him. And the de aged scenes are pretty descent. Now Pheobe Waller Bridge is so annoying to watch, her over the top know at all attitude made me want to walk out of theater, and she and Ford just never clicked. Mads Michaelson is pretty good has the bad guy. But the sense of fun just wasn't there this time, as the film started to get to the point, I was losing interest. Some moments I liked, but all in all I was just wanting this to end."
tt1462764,6.0,"I just got out of Indiana Jones & The Dial of DestinyThey have only gone and done it!! They have made a dull, boring Indiana Jones movie!! This is going to pain me to write.It started out great (the first 20 minutes or so) then it's just very meh as it really drags to its ending!! If you don't like what Mangold did to Logan in Logan, you won't like what he has done to Indiana Jones here. He is an old, grumpy; miserable, very depressed alcoholic, who bores his students to sleep and he has retirement forced on him.The chase sequences are clearly green screen and CGI and it really stands out!! It never feels real.Ford is game, and almost everything he does in this movie is believable. John Williams score is the best thing about this movie.Phoebe Waller Bridge is just one annoying woman, I never bought their relationship for one second, nothing feels real. None of her jokes landed and in the full movie, there was only one laugh in my screening and that was during a Raiders of The Lost Ark call back.Mads Mickelson is as reliable as ever. He always delivers, so no complaints here.It pains me to say, I'll probably never watch it again. Now it's time to drink away my disappointment."
tt1462764,6.0,"The fifth & final instalment in the Indiana Jones franchise and also the first to not be helmed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny brings the famous archaeologist back for one final outing yet finishes as a bland & bloated blockbuster that fails to replicate the magic & bravado of its predecessors despite having all the necessary ingredients at its disposal.Co-written & directed by James Mangold (Logan & Ford v Ferrari), the film opens with a thrilling & action-packed prologue that brings the titular artefact into play but then it follows it up with a series of events that just unfold with a straightforward monotonousness. Despite being the final chapter, it doesn't have the urgency, even the exposition is lame, and the action set pieces lack flavour.What makes the ride dull is the same rinse-n-repeat approach that surface throughout the film in addition to it not having any genuine sense of danger or adventure or escalation. Humour is often poorly timed and the picture also fails to provide John Williams any moment to allow his music to soar. Harrison Ford manages to hold his own in spite of the frailty in his performance but the rest are forgettable.Overall, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny begins on a promising note but gets bogged down by issues of its own makings. Most of the problems plaguing this latest sequel can be found in The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull too but even that disparaged entry employed better use of shots, cuts & outrageous set pieces. This one fares somewhat better as a whole but it is still a lifeless, overlong & mediocre offering."
tt1462764,6.0,"The plot was surprisingly good, as I was expecting some MCU multiverse hijinks but was instead given a more grounded approach to time travel. It felt like a breath of fresh air in that sense.Madds was a good villain. He had a cool backstory and plan in this film and was well-acted.The action was good. Not much with Indiana's whip, which is a bit disappointing. Then again, Ford is in his 80's so I understand. I enjoyed the action scenes despite their limitations.However... Phoebe Waller-Bridge made me wanna walk out of the theatre (not really, because I payed for normal tickets and was seated in a Screen X theatre by mistake). Her lines were awful. She ate food with her mouth open and came across very cocky for no good reason. She didn't seem to deserve to be the character she was. I hated her in this movie."
tt1462764,6.0,"I love Raiders of the Lost Ark from 1981, I like the second movie Temple of Doom from 1984, but I like the first movie more, I love the movie The Last Crusade from 1989 as much as the first movie, but I like it more than the second movie, and I thought the fourth movie Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from 2008 was mediocre, with the first three movies being better. The fifth and last movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was good and a good ending to the character, with it being better than the fourth movie, and little better than the second movie, but I still think the first and third movie is better.Despite his age, Harrison Ford is still great as Indiana Jones many years later; he is retiring from his job, and he is watching how the world changes around him since his younger years. Going on this last adventure to find something a friend of his was looking for, and to stop the villain from getting his hands on it, while also dealing with his goddaughter who wants it for her own reasons. I like how Indy is getting tired of doing what he is doing but also still has some love for adventure, he was also good in action scenes in the certain places they go to.Indy's goddaughter Helena played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge was not bad, I would have liked more done with her character by showing how she became the way she is, or how she could have learned certain things that are useful on the adventure, along with her sidekick named Teddy who was like Short Round from Temple of Doom. I liked the main villain Dr. Voller played by Mads Mikkelsen; his plan involving the Dial was interesting with his plans with the Nazis, and that he has a backstory involving an interaction with Indiana Jones; he was not much of an archaeologist, he knew and used math more to use in his plan that involves time.The opening involves a de-aged Harrison Ford that does look good, but sometimes the voice can sound older than he looked but also it would fit. The opening was great, it looked like the original movies and felt like them with a great action sequence that also sets up the main villain; all the action scenes are fun, nicely shot, suspenseful, and fast paced. Director James Mangold did a wonderful job giving this movie the same look and feel as the original movies directed by Steven Spielberg. The locations or caves they go through look cool, and interesting on how they tie to major points in history.The third act will divide some people, but because of other weird things that happen in the earlier movies, it was not that hard to believe; leading to an ending that is sweet and a nice end for the character. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was a nice ending that had callbacks to the earlier movies, great action, a fantastic musical score from John Williams, and Harrison Ford giving his all in his last movie as this famous character. This movie is not flawless, but I had fun with it, and I think fans will too."
tt1462764,6.0,"Indiana Jones movies were not always about the action or the grandeur, and they also showcased significant character dynamics, convincing comedic punches and, most importantly, the quirky, over-the-top nature imbued deeply in their expositions.All the things that this newer reboot/expansion has missed out on.Now, many might argue that modern-day filmmaking necessitates a modern-day approach and new-age sensibilities, and I could have agreed to that had it not been a part of a widely celebrated franchise!When you think of an expansion, taking the reins of a beloved series, you're obliged to give the audience a fan service. There's only so much room available for amendments. I like James Mangold as a director and adored some of his previous works (Logan, Ford vs. Ferrari). I do believe he's a capable filmmaker, but he hadn't done justice here.The kind of comedy that I treasured during my visits to the previous entries of the series was nowhere to be found. Phoebe Waller-Bridge seemed like a misfit in this universe, and as if that wasn't bad enough, the pacing was also horrendous. The 150 minutes of runtime occasionally wears you down; you would feel the stretch of time, and that's not a good indication.The only positives to take away from this film are the barrage of action blocks and Mr. Jones himself. I've always cheered for Mr. Ford in this character, and I genuinely believe he was born to play this role, and he does play it effortlessly every time. This was no exception. It's such a pleasure to watch him play this character.We will miss you, Indy!"
tt1462764,6.0,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but it's still completely unnecessary. I consider Dial of Destiny to be a second chance at an appendix to Indy's story. The plot of this movie never seems to get out of second gear. In fact, I was surprised when I realized the climax of the film had passed. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is fine in her role, but she seems to be trying to steal the spotlight at times. And while the de-aging visual effect has improved, it just doesn't look quite right. For me, Indiana Jones is still a trilogy that concludes with the Last Crusade."
tt1462764,6.0,"For diehard defenders of the entire INDIANA JONES franchise (not just those who feel that RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK stands alone since it was never called INDIANA JONES AND THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK), they'll throw the titular Ark of the Covenant coming alive with floating spirits whenever the later episodes go too far into the fantasy or, for the last two ventures, science-fiction and/or science-fantasy realm... but had RAIDERS ended up with Indy in Jerusalem B. C. or seated at The Last Supper for THE LAST CRUSADE, well, then...To give one small thing away with DIAL OF DESTINY would blow the entire cover, but basically new helmer James Mangold deliberately makes the Steven Spielberg action-directing-playbook a helluva lot noisier and way more needlessly violent: anyone helping-out the now extremely-aged and initially grouchy Jones will wind up quickly dead, making those random map-scattered characters not matter much beyond moving the bombastic adventure from one point to another -- in itself an important action-packed aspect which is often done decently enough...But the worst fan reviews have gone to the newest sidekick in Indiana's goddaughter played by the extremely tall and cocky Phoebe Waller-Bridge, actually more an attempted female version of the selfishly-driven RAIDERS French archeologist/middleman-heavy, Belloq, wanting fast cash for what's pricelessly meant as a museum artifact...Which is what Harrison Ford is at this point... an artifact... and the movie plays the old gruff sore-boned fella not only too much at times, but the randomly rejuvenated ""I've been doing this stuff all along"" hero doesn't seem very natural while, during various pockets of chase sequence escapades, the plot gets dizzy in a tiresome and complicated balancing act...Following the too-often-separated goals of Jones, the goddaughter Helena (with her own spry child sidekick, basically a sidekick's sidekick), and the central German Nazi, here played by Mads Mikkelsen, donning an omnipresent dull frown despite the usual Indy-villain obsession of obtaining the impossible by any means possible ie shadowing Jones since he always gets there first...Making DIAL ultimately feel more like a high-priced, multi-level video game (in particular the de-aged young Harrison Ford prologue) but that often feels maneuvered by a true franchise fan, trying their best to present a sky's-the-limit finale that ironically only works when it's not trying so hard to be... an INDIANA JONES movie."
tt1462764,6.0,"Overall the movie stayed true enough to its roots and it's still acceptable in the Indy series but just barely.Pros:hits the Indiana Jones cues with some nice Easter eggsevokes some nostalgiaopening sequence feels very Indiana Jones like.still an adventureSalah returnsCons:overly long run time, poor camera angles on the action sequencesincredibly large plot holes. More than ever the villain just seems to always know where they're going and arrives at the perfect time.the acting is quite poor and wooden.the script has weird jokes that don't really hit.new things about the Dial of Destiny are just made up on the fly, you still don't know exactly how it works by the end.the face editing on Indiana Jones in the opening sequence doesn't match the voice."
tt1462764,5.0,"In The Monkey's Paw (spoilers for a 100 years old horror classic, I guess), the protagonists, after the death of a loved one, use a cursed artifact to bring him back, only to find a shambling undead monstrosity knocking at their door.Being a movie nerd in these days is a similar experience: the franchises you loved as a kid keep coming back, and for a while, maybe after a decent trailer, you are happy and optimistic... but then you see them and regret their return.In fact, Hollywood just can't let a beloved series end at the right moment. Alien should have ended with Aliens, and it got a diarrhea of terrible sequels, prequels and spin-offs; Terminator with T2, and I've lost count of the reboots; Star Wars with Return of the Jedi, and it got the awful sequels (I'm giving the prequels a pass because they at least tried to tell an interesting story)...... and, of course, Indiana Jones should have ended with The Last Crusade. It would have been an amazing trilogy (I have my issues with Temple of Doom but oh boys, is it looking better in retrospect), and now it has not one but two pointless sequels.So, is this one better or worse than Skull? I'd say more or less on par: not terrible and unwatchable but clunky and mediocre.Ford was my favorite actor as a kid (""Imagine being both Indy and Han Solo!""), and he gives it all here, but the sad truth is, he was already too old in Skull, and that was 15 years ago.Mangold is a solid director but Indy movies live and die on the strength of their set-pieces, and he isn't prime Steven Spielberg. Then again, who is? Not even Spielberg himself nowadays, since the set-pieces in Skull already sucked.Mangold keeps the camera too close so we do not get the geography of the action; his set-pieces are all momentum and no triumphant release. See the scene with the underwater relic and the eels, a cool premise which peters out into nothing. Also, the protagonists (especially Indy) rarely if ever do anything COOL to resolve the action - a crack of the whip, a last-second dive: they are just there, ping-ponging between different obstacles.Story construction is bloated, with pointless characters (the governative agents, the Moroccan mobster), setups without payoffs (""continental drift"") and endless tedious exposition: a scene with Waller-Bridge (moderately less annoying than I was expecting, but it was a low bar) smugly decrypting a tablet with a clue feels like the longest ten hours I've ever spent in a movie theater.Here's a hint, scriptwriters: characters dealing with treasure hunt clues is only interesting if we, the audience, can also SEE the clue and GUESS the possible answer. Otherwise, it's like watching someone on the bus mumble as he does his Sudoku, and you can't even peek over his shoulder.Dial of Destiny takes a weird turn in the last act and I sort of wish they had embraced the sheer cheesiness of it. I enjoyed a couple of scenes (the prologue is decent enough), but, if you absolutely need a good Indy sequel, play the old adventure game The Fate of Atlantis.5/10."
tt5433140,5.0,"By this point, I went to see Fast X without a clue as to what happened in the last one. I think some people went to space.The F&F series is one where villains become friends, people come back from the dead and cars defy the laws of physics. No one has an idea of the story soon after they watched it.A plot inspired by Fast 5, where they stole a safe and rode it along the streets of Rio de Janeiro.Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is the sociopathic son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and he wants to make Dom Toretto and his family suffer for what happened to his dad.The main action starts by dropping a big rolling bomb in Rome and aim it for the Vatican.Plagued with behind the scenes issues. Original director Justin Lin departed soon after shooting started. Director Louis Leterrier does a workmanlike job. As he showed in the Netflix series Lupin, Now You See Me as well as The Transporter movies. He can do car stunts as well as sleight of hand. Some of the CGI looked cheap though.As for Momoa, the director obviously told him. Man you will never play the Joker, too Polynesian. So Dante is your Joker and dial it up to 12. He is loud, camp and is having a ball. Especially with those two IT guys with a funny grin on their faces.Some of the regulars are even more tiresome. A few should had showed up but did not like those two Brazilian guys from the earlier movies. John Cena plays lovable Uncle Jacob, he was the main villain in the last one.The movie actually has four Oscar winning actresses. Not one of them told Vin Diesel how to do dramatic.

Screw the logistics, screw physics, and screw Newton with his screwing apple tree!

I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste."

Well I think that's how Fast X was written. It's a mish-mash of the previous 9 films rolled into one with cameo appearances from almost anyone who's ever starred in any of them. The problem is the story is nonsensical - we have jumps to shoots all around the world for no reason at all. We have a few maudlin scenes from the past. And of course (this is not a spoiler as it's now everywhere in the press) Fast X is not in fact the last film of the franchise so there is no closure of any sort at the end. The cast felt tired, going through the motions. I think even they think there's maybe been too many movies in this franchise. The only saving grace here was the wonderfully over the top villain played brilliantly by Jason Momoa - every scene he was in stood out.Yes there's the usual over the top stunts (though personally I thought not as good as some of the previous films) racing for no real point, fight scences etc so the fans of the franchise will probably enjoy it.

The voice work of the actors is not outstanding, the musical themes fail to be memorable when listening to them in different scenes of the film and the design of the new characters is not innovative. The film manages to stand out thanks to its colorful animation with touches of glitter, gel objects, macrame and other materials related to crafts, achieving quality visuals. A passable film that falls below its predecessors."
tt14362112,5.0,"Animation was great. Voice acting was great. It was even a good story. The actors and animators did their jobs excellently!But there were far too many inappropriate references for a kid's movie (drugs, sex, etc.) and so the script needed to be more age appropriate. Granted, some of it will go over their heads but the ""chaining me up on our wedding night"" and ""let's make out"" and ""the ring pop that gets you high"" are just not appropriate.I know this is common for kids movies (like Shrek) but this was overboard. I wasn't comfortable with my five year old seeing this so we won't be rewatching it.Also, this is just a personal preference I have as a musician, there is way too much autotune in these movies. It's like listening to a computer sing."
tt17009348,6.0,"Short review: This was the third Secret Screening at Fantastic Fest this year. When it was announced I had never heard of it and had to do a quick IMDb search to find out what I was in for. It didn't really sound like my kind of thing, but I went in with an open mind hoping to be pleasantly surprised. It was a middling film. It had some good stuff, it had some bad stuff. But for the most part, other than a great performance by Caleb Landry Jones, it was pretty forgettable.The film takes the approach of: who could hate dogs? It gets a lot of its brownie points from close ups of dogs making cute faces. It works, but it's also a little cheap and easy.I heard mixed things about this after the show. Some saying it their favourite of the fest, others saying their least favourite. I can see it being quite a divisive experience. For me it was somewhere in the middle. 6/10."
tt17009348,6.0,"I was very intrigued by the premise and the story, which did not initially disappoint. However, as the story unravels it becomes more difficult to believe and ends up in a mess. The pacing seems off, as the ending scenes seem rushed and lacking. The build up to the culminating point is just flat and the ending is predictable, which really is not what I personally am looking for. There are scenes simply contradicting each other and completely making no sense by the the end. Some details of the story are so far from reality it makes the whole experience unrelatable. It would really all be easy to overlook if the film was gripping, but it isn't. However, the acting is the one thing that kept me watching until the end, making the main character the best thing about the entire movie. If you're a Besson fan or want a decent film for the evening, it's a good choice. However, I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece or would vow a keen viewer."
tt17024450,6.0,"The Equalizer 3 is a solid concluding chapter to this entertaining trilogy. Even with an entirely new setting and cast, it does a great job of setting everything up and making you care about his new relationships. The movie overall is entertaining and mostly satisfying.As usual, Denzel is a beast. Charm and charisma are off the charts, this isn't news. Like with part 2, there are few looks he gives that chill me to the bone. It's so impressive the way he portrays being the nicest guy in one scene and the scariest guy in another.The only thing holding this back from being great is the surprising lack of action. Now I wouldn't call either of the previous movies action-packed. But I would estimate this one has a total of about 7 minutes of action. That's just not enough. And it especially hurts during the not-so-climactic climax.I still had a good time with this movie. If you like the series, I think you will be pleased. And to Hollywood: more Denzel please!

Anyway, if you love to watch Denzel Washington and just want some explosions and bum bum, you still can put this one on your to watch list. Production is solid, Denzel cool as ever, that's about it. My rate for the first one is 8, the second got a 6, this one gets a 5 but no more."
tt17024450,5.0,"Was forever searching up Equalizer 3 on Google sine the 2nd film & it was always just plain speculation. It was only until early this year though, that we would be getting a 3rd & until I discovered recently, a final entry in the Equalizer Franchise. I was hoping this would be good, but sadly it didn't quite hit the mark.The film sees Robert McCall who finds himself at home in Southern Italy, but, he discovers his friends are under the control of local crime bosses. As events turn deadly, McCall knows what he has to do: become his friends' protector by taking on the mafia.I found the film to be pretty weak. For starters, there's literally no action & any of that action that we see here, is way too few & far between. The story makes no sense whatsoever & it didn't help that a lot of the dialogue was foreign & subtitled as if the plot was hard enough to grasp as it was.Our main man just plods along after a killer opening for nearly a good hour & I found myself feeling frustrated with the fact that he wasn't doing what he did best. I mean, they could've easily had him go about his day-today life in Sicily & had him kicking arse & taking care of business, but no. We get a weak & flat film that drags along & along for 60% of the film. Disappointing.The action was good & the ending wasn't bad despite being weak in itself. I mean, just letting the main bad guy fumble about like a drunken lout throthing like a rabid rot wiler dog? No badarse fighting duel? Like I said, the gore was there & the action really deliver, but it was too few & far between.The film drags after the opening & if it's bad enough we don't get to see McCall doing what he does best, nothing remotely interetsing happens between the opening & the 3rd act. It's frustrating as given the first 2 films delivering like they did. I mean, did it not occur to the makers here that the film dragged on for a good hour with no action?This film seriously reminds me of Halloween Ends so much, a disappointing end to a promising trilogy. And to add insult to injury, this is the last one in the Franchise. What a way to send off the character for crying out loud...Despite the actors doing a good enough of a job in the 102 minute (1hr & 42min) film, it really lacked for me. The villains weren't even that interesting, not to mention their motivations.Overall, it's a disappointing & weak entry & final to the trilogy. From the lack of action, to the incoherent story to the dragged out feel to the ironically shortest film of the trilogy. This film really didn't cut the mustard & this is despite the gruesome action we got (what little of it) & characters who weren't all the interesting apart from the man himself ironically enough doing little to fa for 60% of the film. What a way to end the franchise. This is definitely the weakest one. Go watch it, but you'll be frustrated after the opening trust me.5/10."
tt17024450,5.0,"The movie, Equalizer 3, starts out well. There is a rather good slow action scene to start the movie. But it is all downhill from there.Without ever really establishing a plot or a reason for why the Equalizer is where he is today, the movie does not flow like the other films. There is a mafia connection, but nothing else to really tell us why the Equalizer is doing what he is doing or why he is even still there.Like so many sequels, there is usually either more sex, blood, or violence. For Equalizer 3, it is definitely violence. There are some scenes where you almost have to look away because of how violent they are.It is just an awful story line about mafia, drugs, and possible terrorist ties that did not make sense. Like the film itself, everyone seems to know that Mr. McCall, the Equalizer, is a special person whereas the previous films tended to hide his unique abilities. There is no anonymity to the person or the story anymore.The previous plots were personal in nature while this one is completely impersonal. We get a hint at the end of the movie that there might have been a personal connection, but the story line is so convoluted that I could not figure out what the personal connection was or how it fit.The movie has enough action to get through it. But do not expect the level of story and plot line like you found in the first film or even the second. It simply is not there. Like a lot of sequels, this movie gets away from what made it such a good first movie to begin with."

tt19637052,6.0,"""Love Lies Bleeding"" is endlessly thrilling, unapologetically gruesome, and potently lustful in its perception of love, or in this case, more so in the idea of attachment. Rose Glass immediately develops an identity on a pulsating energy that intensifies as secrets begin to unravel and intertwine with one another, paired with a score that'll find its way beneath your skin. The visual details are addictive. From extreme close up shots enhanced by an accurate, yet sometimes uncomfortable sound design, to a dark red color palette and slower frames of movement to provoke darkness and uneasiness. Due to timely humor and several montage sequences, there's a lighthearted disguise that masks the severity of how exaggerated and ambitious this story actually is. Whether this works or doesn't work is for you to decide, but regardless of how you feel about the story collectively, I'm confident that there's a refreshing surprise for everyone to experience."
tt3402236,5.0,"'Murder on the Orient Express' as a book is, speaking as a big Agatha Christie fan, one of her best with a compelling and twisty story, many characters that are also nicely developed and one of her most ingenious endings (along with 'And Then There Were None', 'Death on the Nile', 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd' and 'Witness for the Prosecution').Of the four filmed adaptations of 'Murder on the Orient Express' the only outstanding one is the 1974 Sidney Lumet film, which is one of the best cinematic Agatha Christie adaptations to me. The others are the David Suchet version, which is often considered one of the worst of the series but from personal opinion while very flawed it's better than given credit for, and the 2001 Alfred Molina version which is a mess. This latest version has a good deal going for it but feels like an adaptation too far. Actually saw it a couple of days ago, but was not sure what my thoughts on it were.Let's start with 'Murder on the Orient Express's' good things. It is a very beautiful film visually, very elegantly shot, lots of stunning scenery, sumptuous costumes that are evocative of the period and a train that has the grandeur and claustrophobic confinement that is necessary. The make-up is also wonderfully elaborate. The story does have some intriguing moments and it is a very clever one in the first place. Poirot is an interesting as he should be. Kenneth Branagh does a very nice job with the visual style, the script is thought-provoking and Poirot's crime-solving is delightful. The relative faithfulness to the source material is commendable too.He also stars as Poirot and generally is surprisingly good, he is very commanding, suitably steely and captures his crime-solving skills beautifully. He could however have brought out more of Poirot's lighter and more eccentric side, like the obsessiveness, there isn't enough of that here. The cast is star studded and generally the acting is very good. Standouts include Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, a surprisingly well-cast and suitably conflicted Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley, Derek Jacobi and Willem Dafoe also make much of not very much.Conversely, there are other elements that don't work. The mystery itself is intriguing as a story but doesn't have enough tension or energy. With so many characters and so much focus on Poirot, the exploration of the supporting characters is limited, meaning many of the characters are really sketchy in development. Branagh excels in the visual side of the direction but it comes at the expense at providing enough depth to the mystery.The film has a slow and awkwardly staged beginning and the ingenious denouement feels under-cooked and contrived for an ending so justifiably famous and brilliant. Just to make it clear, the problem is not the denouement itself, it's the execution of it that's the problem. While the cast are on very good form mostly, an exception is Johnny Depp. Really didn't get the sense that Rachett was a nasty piece of work, like in the book and especially Toby Jones' interpretation in the Suchet adaptation when talking of the previous versions, and that the performance was too much of a pale caricature of Depp's lesser roles. Have really liked a lot of what Patrick Doyle has done, but this is not one of his better music scores. It's not awful, but it is blandly uninspired and its slightly syrupy feel doesn't fit. Oh, and Branagh's moustache is like a character of its own and am really not sure as to whether that is a compliment or not.In summary, some good things that stops it from completely derailing but the lack of steam makes it a bland endeavour, this wonderful story and Christie deserve better. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
tt3402236,5.0,"Difficult Kenneth Branagh makes, produces, and stars in good movies, and this version of Murder on the Orient Express features impressive sets, beautiful scenery, and lovely period clothes. An impressive case features Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, and Kennth Branagh as Hercule Poirot. I think those who are not familiar with Agatha Christie, Poirot, or the story may very well like this movie.I, on the other hand, was massively disappointed, especially by Branagh as a sort of English upper-class colonel with a stick-on cavalry moustache and by the needless addition of an introductory scene at the Wailing Wall. But I am prejudiced. I read the 1934 novel decades ago and again more recently. I liked the 1974 star-studded version with Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, and Michael York—despite the fact that Albert Finney was a very poor version of Christie's Hercule Poirot. In my opinion, the 2010 television version of the story starred David Suchet as the definitive Poirot, and the ending was far and away the best of all the versions with which I am familiar. So I think Christie fans may want to skip this edition of the classic."
tt3402236,5.0,"Why did Kenneth Branagh want to make a third version of this classic Agatha Christie story knowing remakes of classic films rarely are successful?The previous two versions the film in 1974 with Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot and the 2010 television version with David Suchet are both superb.If you haven't seen either you probably may enjoy this as I don't criticise the acting or production . It's an interesting cast I enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of Caroline Hubbard so classily played in the original by Lauren Bacall and Branagh gives a credible performance as Poirot.What I missed was the elegance of the original the original score by Richard Rodney Bennett is one of my all time favourite film scores ,used so evocatively in the original film it gave the Orient Express an identity motif forever etched in film history.The music score in this attempt is bland and the song at the end credits so saccharine sweet and forgettable I've forgotten it already.If you make a remake film that's so well known you can't help comparing the original cast and in 1974 we had Albert Finney, Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall , Dame Wendy Huller , Richard Widmark, Sean Connery, John Gielgud , Rachel Roberts and Vanessa Redgrave to name a few , yet not one of the new cast including Dame Judy Dench eclipses any of the performances of the original film . The costumes and sets are very good in this version but again in 1974 even without blue screens and cgi effects the elegance and luxury of the original is not improved with this version. So to me the good performances and production of this movie were wasted on this expensive film and the tweaking of the story line was totally unnecessary and in one instance concerning the Caroline Hubbard role ridiculous.Without giving anything away or spoiling it for audiences who haven't seen the original, apart from recommending the 1974 version to this one I was horrified at the hint at the end of the movie that Kenneth Branagh may remake ""Death on the Nile""I sincerely hope not. What next will we a have Kenneth Branagh remake of Gone With The Wind starting himself as Rhett Butler and Anne Hathaway as Scarlett??."
tt3402236,6.0,"This movie was clearly made for a modern audience with no familiarity with Agatha Christie's work. Branagh's portrayal of the legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot bares only a passing resemblance to the source material with an inconsistent accent, the wrong mustache, and only some of his iconic quirks and mannerisms. That being said, it is a decent mystery that follows the plot of the story pretty well and it would probably be enjoyable to people seeing the story for the first time and having no preconceived notions of what Poirot should be.A strong supporting cast featuring Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, and many other familiar faces performs well. However, no one stands out in the way Ingrid Bergman did in the 1974 adaptation or Jessica Chastain in the 2010 version.There were also several semi-action moments that were incredibly out of character for Poirot, yet provided no actual excitement to justify the sudden stylistic change. The ending hints at Death on the Nile being the next mystery for this detective masquerading as Poirot to tackle, but Poirot should not be summoned to solve a murder, he simply stumbles upon them whenever he goes on vacation."

tt3402236,6.0,"I have to agree with several others who have commented on this film. It lacks any sort of spark. Each actor plays to the camera and there is little interaction among them. Johnny Depp is pretty good as the victim, but even he seems a caricature. It is a star studded cast and that may have been a mistake. Branagh's Poirot is so dull. And that awful mustache. It looks like he glued on the bristles from a hair brush. The plot is confusing and there is little mystery. When I saw the first film, I knew the ending, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are several strange events that take place in this one. Poirot is way to brusque and unpleasant. My picture of him is a kind of shyness. The ending scene, where things are explained and the murderer revealed, is incredibly dull. Too much hoopla and not enough good direction."
tt3402236,5.0,"Just don't mess with something unless you can do it better. Kenneth Branagh directs and stars as Hercule Poirot in this rendition Agatha Christie's classic. The cinematography is worth talking about. Watching the fabled Oriental Express race through snow-swept mountains before it derails. The claustrophobic luxury train of course becomes the site of a murder that Poirot is all but obligated to solve.Big star names flood the cast; Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer are the only two who earned their paycheck. Also featured are Willem Dafoe, Josh Gad, Tom Bateman,Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr., Olivia Colman and Judi Dench. Branagh is all thumbs trying to show masculinity in the lead character."
tt21942866,6.0,"So, having heard nothing about this film, never mind seeing a trailer or preview for it, I went into this one blind with only the synopsis to go by.The film stars Nicolas Cage as a hapless family man who finds his life turned upside down when millions of strangers suddenly start seeing him in their dreams. When his nighttime appearances take a nightmarish & sinister turn, Paul is forced to navigate his newfound stardom.I found the film to be bizarre. I'm still right now trying to process what I watched. It was pretty engaging despite being dragged out in places & kept you wanting to know more & why the main lead was being dreamed about & of course, why the dreams about him turn sinister & violent.The film's story & concept is definitely unique & did remind me (& is funnily enough parodied here) like A Nightmare On Elm Street. The horror aspects (what little there was) were good & there's some awkward, yet funny & humourous scenes to be had.What annoyed me about the film was the lack of explanation as to why people were dreaming about Paul Matthews & of course why the dreams turned sour.Moreover, the unlike-ability of the characters in the film, the family members, the students, his friends & others treating him like he was a criminal. Couldn't these people in the film tell the difference between fantasy & reality? Were they that gullible & dumb to not know the difference? The way he was treated in the film really made me feel sorry for the guy. It was both annoying & hard to watch to be honest. Not to mention they way they blamed him for something that was completely out of his control. Unbelievable.The film itself was pretty depressing in a lot of areas & towards the end we didn't get any reconciliation of the characters that treated him badly & continued to blame him for the nightmares they were having. The film did have a decent runtime of 1 hour & 36 minutes (96 minutes) & not bad pacing despite being sluggish in areas.Overall, it's a mixed bag this one. There's some good points & bad. It's an out there type of film which is neither good or bad, but ok & bizarre. Judge for yourself when you come to see it.6/10."

The story is an allegory for fame.

What would happen if he tryed to feel other emotions before sleeping? What if he tryed lucid dreaming? What if he tryed to stop dreaming? What if he was smart enough as a college professor and avoided conflict and called the cops and sued people, instead of getting physical with them? Why only one girl had sex dreams with him?"
tt21942866,5.0,"Just back from the theater. My rating of 5/10 really reflects more my personal reaction to it, rather than how well it was done and acted. It's advertised as a comedy, but there aren't really many laughs, and I wouldn't even call it a black comedy. As we watch Paul Matthews' (Nicolas Cage) life slowly disassemble through no fault of his own, it wanders fully into the horror regime. Not some crude slasher type of thing -- stylisically this is closer to what Alfred Hitchcock might have made with the same material. And personally I just don't react well to horror -- there are twenty different things I'd rather do with my time, thanks. If I hadn't been with friends, I might not have sat through it all.Not that it's a bad production. On the contrary, it's well acted (and thus effective) and Nic Cage displays all his considerable acting skills to the full. Matthews is a sort of dumpy middle-aged professor at some small college who's a failed researcher and a rather ordinary teacher. Everything about him is ordinary. He's not dislikable but not terribly interesting or likable either, and is just generally ineffectual at everything at either work or home. He's not someone you would want to spend a lot of time with. (Paradoxically, Cage is so good at conveytng Paul's lackluster life and inner nature that he actually makes us less interested to watch!) Paul likes the momentary fame of being at the center of this unique communal dream phenomenon, but when it takes a violent turn (in the dreams, that is) he doesn't seem to know what to do, gives in to his buried rage, and ends up participating in his own destruction.There's lots of satire of modern life, like cancel culture, New Age woo-woo thinking, the emptiness of suburbia, monetization and corporatization of practically anything, and me-first attitudes -- but I felt like these were secondary to the main thread of horror/tragedy. Sorry, but not for me. The thing is that if some explanation had been given for why this communal-dream phenomenon was happening, and thus what to do about it, it would have been more in the direction of a science-fiction movie. I might have found that more interesting. When word gets around that this obscure person is appearing in all kinds of peoples' dreams, researchers would jump on it and treat it as a huge puzzle to be solved -- something that would reveal much about the brain and collective unconscious and so forth. There's no sign that any of that is happening here, it's all focussed on the reactive effects on Paul and his life. In the end I'm not sure what to take away from this thing."
tt21942866,6.0,"Others have put this film as 'hilarious' and I went expecting a comedyI would not describe it as a comedy however, there was one scene I laughed out loud at .I took this film as a metaphor for how people are arbitarily cancelled.Cage put in a great performance as a professor 'cancelled' without any morale justification or evidence, and every one knows he did nothing wrong. I presume is an analagy to how 'the woke' arbitarily cancel others with a nod to hypocrisy at the end where ideas are then embraced.Other than that, I'm not really sure what this film is about and in the last 15 minutes are so I was hoping it would end soon.Would I watch it again ? NoIt's quite a dissmal / dark film (in my opinion). Don't get me wrong, it is well made, well acted (particularly by Cage) and certainly an original idea.I'm glad I watched it, but didn't particularly enjoy it 6.5/10."
tt21942866,6.0,"When college professor ""Matthews"" (Nicolas Cage) starts appearing in the dreams of strangers (oh, and his wife!), his whole life is turned topsy-turvy. Initially it's all a rather benign phenomenon with his appearances fleeting, inconclusive and harmless. Until, that is, he meets one person who has been having a rather more intimate experience. Not only does this meeting not go very well (on various levels!) but it seems to change the very nature of the illusions for everyone, turning them more into nightmares... A predictable, occasionally violent, backlash ensues which makes the man's life - and that of his family - all but insufferable. What to do now his fame has come back to bite him? I quite enjoyed the first half hour of this quirky and entertainingly written drama. Cage is always rather good at taking the rise out of himself, and he seems to be enjoying the ride at the start. Once the story turns a bit darker, though, it runs out of steam. It's charm and uniqueness becomes rather subsumed in a rather unsubtle whack at the ""cancel culture"" that exists amongst those who live their lives via social media. It's not the first or the best to draw a parallel between what's real and what's fact - even when such distinctions are easily identifiable, and after a while I felt the film had no clear idea of how to conclude without actually proving it's own, rather depressing, point. The idea is interesting, the delivery is fine - but the end product is all a bit underwhelming."

Farming is a struggle and he works at a chicken factory. There is tension in the marriage. Out of the blue, Terrance (Aaron Pierre) comes to their door. He's recruiting for space pioneers and maybe do a little threatening on top of that.There is an interesting sci-fi concept and an intriguing reveal somewhere in this movie. I can't buy the undercooked sci-fi concept. As a mystery, the movie is holding back a few pieces in the puzzle and the audience is kept waiting. The terrific pairing of Mescal and Ronan is giving it their all, but the movie keeps going in circles. The surrealism mounts until the movie goes down the drain."

My Rating. 5/10The impressive acting by the trio of stars in Foe from Saorise Ronan and Paul Mescal and Aaron Pierre couldn't salvage this angst ridden dystopian self indulgent melodrama for me .For me this movie is a confusing mish mash of scenes that at times reminded me of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf meets Frankenstein at The Rocky Horror Show.Set in 2065 For's about the sad lives of a young couple Hen played by Saorise Ronanand her husband Junior played by Paul Mescal who oddly works in a poultry abattoir as he's married to a Hen.Filmed in Victoria and South Australia Foe takes place in Americas MidWest and tells the story of a married couple living a life of isolation in a wasteland that's been denuded of any vegetation as a result of the neglect that our planet is experiencing today .A stranger named Terence drives up to their home knocks on the door and tells them the good news that Junior has been chosen because of his obvious fitness and strength to be part of a relocation exercise for Earthlings to find another planet to ruin.Terence assures Junior that Hen will not be left alone as an artificial replacement for Junior complete with all his physical prowess and his memories will take his place while he's away .That's enough plot line the emotional drama then increases as Terence interviews the couple about every intimate part of their relationship warts and all which only uncovers more tension and angst.The novel Foe which I haven't read by Iain Reid is promoted as a taut, psychological mind-bender from the bestselling author of I'm Thinking of Ending Things.The screen play adaptation of the movie by Garth Davis and Iain Reid in my opinion is sloppy and at times mind numbing instead of mind bending .The Direction by Garth Davis considering his previous great movies like Lion and Penguin Bloom I found disappointing it seemed to steer this space ship out of orbit.However the chemistry and charisma of Saorise Ronan and Paul Mescal who is shirtless most of the movie was impressive and I hope they team up again in a better film.Will some author please write an uplifting story set in a future where Politicians and populations overcome the terrible future scenario we are told is inevitable today ?Perhaps it's too late? But the old saying of what we eat today walks and talks tomorrow could be changed to what we think today will become tomorrow comes to mind I'm pleased I won't be here to see it ."
tt8258502,5.0,"This film about a couple living in isolation on a desolate landscape and contemplating the possibility of one of them going to space, leaving behind an identical android ""copy"", has two major advantages and one fatal flaw:(a) It's wonderfully acted, with an electric chemistry between all three main actors.(b) The setting (a house in the middle of a dystopian wasteland) is really atmospheric, both claustrophobic and melancholically beautiful.(c) The screenplay is a disaster. And the lack of originality in the premise is the least of its problems.Ronan and Mescal are two of the best actors of their generation, and I was eagerly waiting to see them act opposite each other. They did the absolute best they could with what they had: two characters without clear background, without foundations, completely lacking transparency in motives and internal journeys. Still, the chemistry was palpable and somewhat rescued what would have otherwise been a completely lifeless film.I watched a review (by Mark Kermode) saying that the film is doing wonderfully up until 2/3 of the way through, when the endless exposition starts and all the magic and mystery is lost. I disagree. I found this film lacking from the very beginning, because you had this wonderful atmosphere that could have felt like watching an intense 3-person stage play, but the dialogues were all wrong. Boring, full of clichés, and establishing nothing. We see the characters have unexplained emotional outbursts, we get contradictory clues about their relationships, the ""mystery"" (you can see the plot twist coming from a mile away) is badly built, no gradual progression.This terribly contrived and pretentious screenplay made me think of Kurt Vonnegut's simple advice for writing: ""Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To hell with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages."" Suspense is not such a bad thing, of course. But when it's prioritised over building comprehensible characters, then things start to go wrong. And it's funny that for a film that hides so much from the viewer in the first two acts, it sure loves exposition in the third act. Like, it goes from one extreme to the other with nothing in between, and with both extremes utterly failing to arouse any emotions.What a waste."
tt8258502,5.0,"Phenomenal acting, a pure masterclass of the two (Ronan and Mescal), directing, plot, script- 0 points. Such great actors in such a pointless movie, with no storyline, a wannabe artistic masterpiece, but it just doesn't go over the ramp.Excellent movie for acting students, as well as the directing ones - how to not direct a movie.For the rest of the world -skip it, unless you are a die-hard fan.Interstellar, but from AliExpress, with a pinch of marriage drama and kilos of boredom, with acting masterclass.Don't have anything else to say, this one is just for the minimum character limit's sake."
tt8258502,6.0,"Anyone think this reminds them of a poor relation of ""Interstellar""? ""Hen"" (Saoirse Ronan) lives on her remote family farm with husband ""Junior"" (Paul Mescal). You get the impression it's a pretty mundane existence and maybe not have been the strongest of relationships when a stranger in what looks like an old De Lorean arrives. It turns out that ""Terrance"" (Aaron Pierre) has come from the supra-governmental agency that's in charge of populating space - yep, the planet is on it's last legs - and that ""Junior"" has been selected to go live upstairs leaving is wife behind. No chance says ""Junior"", no choice says ""Terrance"" but there is some silver lining for ""Hen"". They will make her a carbon copy of her husband to ""keep her company"" whilst he is away. To that end, their visitor must remain for a few weeks to gather information on every intimate detail of their lives together so that ""Junior 2"" can be as authentic as possible. Now we don't actually know this, but it's safe to assume that somewhere in the ensuing proceedings, there is a body swap otherwise the rather dreary and drawn out denouement would make even less sense that it actually does. Is this suppose to be a crit on the nature of human relationships, or of the human psyche? If you went to bed at night and awoke to an identical partner that had been swapped in the night, would you even know? That's the problem. It's a complete non-story that limbers towards it's conclusion without really engaging on any level. That said, man-of-the-moment Mescal does turn in an emotional performance at times, but Ronan is really rather wasted here and the thinly developed characterisation of ""Terrance"" just further consigns this to the doldrums of what looks a short story laggardly dragged out for all but two hours. It's a slow and rather listless film for the most part and contains nothing new. Disappointing."
tt16431870,6.0,"This was a cute movie, where Marky Mark (also producer here) is in a physical shape that is truly exceptional, and married to a beautiful wife with only a very civilized age gap. There's product placement, but not too much. There's staggering violence, but it's all squeaky clean so it can be a Xmas movie. All the supporting cast is ethnic just the right amount. The family is flush with tremendous cash, which helps plot advancement as well as beautiful cinematography / scenes.It was very enjoyable, assuming enough suspension of disbelief. The whole thing is obviously very predictable, but it's executed nicely. Everybody but the teenage daughter is world-class level at something, so while it's promoting family values, it is, for a change, not promoting mediocrity.I watched this while cycling indoors, was perfect to get me through my winter workout."
tt16431870,6.0,"In the realm of mindless action comedies, ""The Family Plan 2023"" treads a well-worn path, featuring Mark Wahlberg as the protagonist, former elite government assassin Dan. Faced with the resurgence of adversaries from his past, Dan opts for an unconventional escape strategy - packing his wife (Michelle Monaghan), teenage daughter, teenage son, and a surprisingly pivotal character, their 10-month-old baby, into a minivan for an impromptu cross-country road trip to Las Vegas.While the film doesn't break any new ground in terms of its narrative, what elevates it from the run-of-the-mill action comedy is the unexpected star power of the youngest member of the ensemble - the adorable 10-month-old baby. In the midst of explosions, car chases, and typical action sequences, the infant manages to steal the spotlight, providing moments of genuine humor and heart that resonate with audiences.Wahlberg and Monaghan deliver performances true to their seasoned capabilities, injecting charm and charisma into their respective roles as parents navigating the chaos. However, it's the interactions involving the 10-month-old that inject a refreshing element into the formulaic proceedings. The clever use of the baby's innocence and unpredictability adds a layer of authenticity to the family dynamic, serving as the unexpected source of both comedic relief and genuine warmth.Despite the film's adherence to a tried-and-true formula, the endearing presence of the youngest family member helps ""The Family Plan 2023"" rise above the monotony. The action-packed road trip may not offer groundbreaking storytelling, but the delightful twist of placing the spotlight on the 10-month-old character gives this predictable family adventure an endearing and memorable touch, making it a worthwhile watch for those seeking a lighthearted blend of action and family dynamics."
tt16431870,6.0,"Mark Wahlberg plays Mark Wahlberg, as usual. Michelle Monaghan is absolutely wonderful. Strangely enough neither of these two shows up in IMDB:s ""Top Cast"" list.The little kid is entertaining.The rest of the cast I do not remember much about, so they did apparently not add too much to it all.The first half of the movie is fun but the second half is quite boring with stupid ""action"" that contains absolutely no blood whatsoever. It is strange how you can get a pole through your upper torso and not bleed at all. It is an ultra processed and clean version of ""Nobody"", albeit with some humour.OK if you want to be entertained for a couple of hours but not more. Ah yes, did I mention it has Michelle Monaghan in it? ;)"
tt16431870,6.0,"So there was some money left and no ideas. How easy is it just to remake a high scoring film but without the large budget. This is so copied from True Lies, even the main character has the same job and there is also the evil Asian woman. The ending with a show out against the baddies in an empty building, same. Between the first and last act there is the road trip ala National Lampoon's Vacation and it feels as boring as the real trip possibly would be. A few scenes are inserted to show how the kids and parents are growing to eachother. The film is trying to copy the light hearted touch of True Lies but fails. Is it a bad film? No surprisingly it is entertaining enough to sit along, mainly due to the main characters Mark Wahlberg and the amazing Michelle Monaghan. It's an actrice I don't see much, but she does a great job and it feels there is chemistry between both persons. And Mark Wahlberg never changes and I still love this guy for his commitment."
tt16431870,5.0,"A completely cliché kind of movie: Some teenagers that are of course always in bad mood change into good kids while a James Bond imitating Mark Wahlberg safes his kidnapped family cause, you know, he was a killer. And how does his family react: Omg he is a killer! But wait we are family, so we need to love him right?Sorry for that but I can't endure anymore movies like The Family Plan.Mark Wahlberg's time is over, I don't even know when the last good movie came out with him starring. Apple wanted another movie (not that they made two movies over the last months for cinema) so the writers thought: wow let's make a funny romantic family action road trip drama movie, man I don't even know how many genres we want to integrate into this movie but it's gonna be awesome! And I have to say the first act isn't that bad. I quiet liked it actually, even if it was a little bit brainless. But what followed was a story that couldn't have been more boring. I don't want to see the classic ending shot where the protagonists walk out of a building with the police already waiting. I want to see a story with twists and turns but besides some left and right turns on the street the movie had nothing like this. If you read reviews to get a recommendation, then I have to disappoint you, cause I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE. Thank you."
tt16431870,5.0,Like a family version of Mr & Mrs Smith. We loved it funny and full of action. Crazy fight scenes. Great chemistry between Mark W and Michell M. And they both have endless energy. Also in great shape.Star of the show is that adorable baby. His sweet little laugh and perfect timing were spot on. Kids of course come around from being always annoyed at their parents and lying to them to being very impressed and learning the true value of family. The Trevor character is everything that's wrong with young people and it's perfect what where he ends up.Far-fetched of course and a little silly but so what. It was a lot of fun to watch.Very entertaining.
tt14160834,6.0,"The prevailing thought I had watching Rustin was that the events depicted were probably exactly how they happened in real life. If this were a documentary that'd be fine but as an actual narrative it just made the whole thing feel very surface level. It has none of the style of movies like Selma or BlackkKlansman which made their depictions of this period so captivating to watch. I don't think the film tackles the civil rights issue in any interesting way and while Bayard Rustin's story absolutely deserves to be told I don't think its importance comes through in the finished product. The whole march that the film is building up to just comes and goes before it has a chance to have any impact. Colman Domingo is great, he absolutely does justice to this character and makes the film at least watchable but he deserved a much better script. An important story in and of itself doesn't create for a good narrative without any kind of vision and that's sorely what Rustin was lacking for me."
tt14160834,6.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. Organizing an event is often tedious and frustrating and stressful. Rarely is it entertaining. Such is the challenge faced by director George C Wolfe (MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM, 2020) and co-writers Justin Breece and Dustin Lance Black (Oscar winner for MILK, 2007). Take that and add a central character that most have never heard of, and the challenge seems questionable, if not undesirable. What happens if that main character has more charisma than the beloved Reverand Martin Luther King? Well, that's something we can work with.Colman Domingo (IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK) stars as Bayard Rustin, the gay, black, outspoken civil rights activist and organizer ... and one-time communist ... who coordinated efforts for the 1963 March on Washington for Freedom and Jobs. If that doesn't sound familiar, it's the official name of the event where MLK gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. That day is remembered for King's speech, but the event never would have occurred without the herculean efforts behind the scenes by Mr. Rustin and his team. Since it wasn't easy, there is a story worth telling.Director Wolfe is a Tony Award winner and his stage roots are on full display. Many scenes play like live theater, and the performances are elevated to the point of over-dramatizing. There is nothing subtle about Bayard Rustin and nothing subtle about the film, with the exception of Ami Ameen as MLK. By watching this, we wonder how King ever became the leader of a movement - and this after an early scene where Rustin urges him to ""own your power"". It's a power we don't see here, yet understand it existed in real life. The film opens by reminding that it was 1954 when the Supreme Court ruled segregation was illegal.Most of what we see occurs in 1963, a couple of years after King and Rustin had a falling out. When the friendship and partnership are re-established for the purposes of the march, it brings together the previously disparate organizations (and their egos) that had been striving independently for power. One in particular was the NAACP, with its director, Roy Wilkins, played here by Chris Rock. The behind-the-scenes bickering and posturing is one of the film's strengths. Other players of interest here include A Philip Randolph (Glynn Turman), Anna Hedgeman (CCH Pounder), Representative Adam Clayton Powell (a properly pompous Jeffrey Wright), and Elias Taylor (Johnny Ramey) as an attraction and distraction for Rustin.The goal of 100,000 peaceful attendees initially seemed nearly impossible, and of course, history tells us the final number was closer to 250,000. This group of activists not only faced opposition from white establishment, including (according to this) the Kennedy brothers, but there was also an incredibly tight timeline to work with. It's the group of dedicated and passionate volunteers that go to the heart of a grassroots movement, and these folks are given their due. The film's weakness is in its attempt to balance the movement with the scandals surrounding Rustin's homosexuality. That angle simply doesn't work as well. As viewers, we are bombarded with monologues galore and stagey acting and scenes, but at the center is a man whose story should be told.In select theaters November 3, 2023 and on Netflix beginning November 17, 2023."
tt14160834,6.0,"I always love it when the unsung heroes of history get their fair due - I must admit that I did not know much about Rustin before this biopic.I think the beginning was fabulous, it had great speed and the camerawork was good but then for me it somehow did not balance well the depiction of the work and his personal life. Also, I hoped the events of the march would be portrayed more but it was somehow almost like pushed in quickly into the last 5 minutes of the movie with no real culmination.Also, what is it with Americans never acknowledging the rest of the world? In the end it says something like ""...with 250 000 people making it the biggest peaceful protest to date."" Is it so hard to add ""in America"" in the end? E.g. The Baltic Way in 1989 when 2 million people from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania joined hands to form the longest unbroken human chain in history to protest their illegal occupation by the Soviet Union in 1940 after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact in 1939? As a history-enthusiast I just don't like such half-true statements being put out there.Otherwise, solid movie with a very good lead and I think it is important that more people get to know about those who have thought for the rights of all."
tt14160834,6.0,"""When we tell ourselves such lies, we do the work of our oppressors."" Bayard Rustin (Coleman Domingo)Who gave MLK the platform for his famous ""I have a dream"" words? None other than Bayard Rustin, the activist, conceptualizer, and organizer of the largest peaceful march on Washington in history. That August demonstration gave Martin Luther King to history while it is now with the docudrama Rustin that Bayard will long be remembered.Even with his posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom, Rustin was not known as well as he could be. One possible contributor to that neglect was his homosexuality, a notoriously damning attribute in the 1960's. In fact, he was booted from MLK'w inner circle for just that reason. The docudrama takes pains to show the extent and sincerity of his romantic commitments, almost to the extent of being less intense about his organizational skills.If I could carp about the drama's limitation, it would be the excessive time given to his love life rather than to the complex web of dependencies needed to attract and accommodate over 200,000 marchers.Director George C. Wolfe and the accomplished Coleman Domingo (sure to be nominated) keep Rustin lovingly in the foreground while they allow such secondary characters as enemy Adam Clayton Powell (Jeffery Wright) and Roy Wilkins (Chris Rock) to interfere as they did back then. Wright's Powell almost upends a meeting, and possibly the entire demonstrations, as he tries to paint Bayard as a danger to the enterprise. The biggest impediment is his being arrested for lewd conduct with men in Pasadena years ago.In the end, Bayard Rustin organized the biggest peaceful demonstration in the nation's history, whose underpinnings were the principles of non-violent resistance, a condition lasting through today, not withstanding the horror of the Jan 6th riot at the CapitolThanks to the docudrama, available on Netflix, Bayard Rustin gave the template for peaceful resistance. Thoreau would approve."
tt14160834,5.0,"This movie wasn't necessarily bad. It has a good lead performance by Colman Domingo and an interesting, still urgent theme. Intentions were good with some good music thrown in the mix.There's even room for some humor.However, apart from an at times dragging script, this film has almost amateuristic editing and sound mixing. Once you've noticed it, you just can't unsee it. Scene after scene you see editing mistakes that kill continuity. Focus on the people in the background, how people hold there cigarettes/mugs/arms/head. It just jumps and skips all over the place.Also, when someone leaves a room, you hear the door slam almost immediately, while in reality they couldn't have already left the room in that amount of time. Watch where doors are located in rooms and where people in that room are situated and then focus on how quickly someone has left that room, because the sound of the door has been mixed in. It's just off.It really annoyed me all movie and the topic of this film deserved better work. The editor has failed this one. Sorry to say.Therefor, in my opinion, an interesting topic, yet a mediocre movie."
tt14160834,6.0,I had no idea who bayard rustin was when I started watching this movie and tbh I can't say with certainty that I know now. Colman domingos preformance was masterful and definitely deserved the Oscar nomination he got but unfortunately this movie wasn't as good as it could've been.Bayard Rustin may very well be one of the unsung heroes of the civil rights movement and this movie does not do him justice. It focuses on a very brief part of this man's life and honestly I'd say it fails to go into the depth and emotion of what an Interesting man he was. A lot of the writing was really lazy and this movie definitely left a lot to he desired. 6/10.
tt22890246,6.0,"It's many decades since I was a teenager, and over 10 since my own kids navigated that period for themselves, but if this really is representative of what it's like for the current generation (and I guess I have to believe it is, at least somewhat), then it's kind of sad, I think. I wish them well.As a film, this takes its time to find a balance, IMHO, but the core characters come through pretty well by the end, although personally I found some of them seriously underwritten (e.g. The lesbian couple) and would have preferred them either silent or absent, or given more to do. However, this is a first-time filmmaker, so perhaps that's a bit harsh.Don't expect a fun time."

It's on their third night that the film stops being a video-diary of hedonistic behaviour as her friend ""Badger"" gets blown away by a poolside experience and she finds herself on her own, then on the beach with... What now ensues begin the elements that provides the crux of the point of the film. When is what we want not what we want, when does yes not really mean yes - or it means yes because you just want to get something over with, or yes because you are just curious, or yes because you are too stoked up to think anything through - and are in the arms of a charismatic person? This isn't a violent film in any graphic sense, but it does have quite an emotionally potent impact for a while as the very much on-form McKenna-Bruce juggles her outward, bouncy and lively persona, with a young woman who is still very much growing up - and vulnerable. I didn't love the last twenty minutes - they robbed the film of the much of the ambiguity that hitherto had made it poignant and a talking point. At this point the behaviour becomes just plain wrong and odious - before they all head home. This is a story about a girl, but it could just as easily be about a boy - under self and peer imposed pressures to perform/conform unaware of the longer-term consequences of sand getting everywhere. Snag for me is that the film is just too much of a fly-on-the-wall documentary for the most part. We have to wait too long before the story starts to make it's point effectively, and then I think it rather rushes and compromises the message. It's still worth a watch, though - and McKenna-Bruce is very confident and impressive."
tt22890246,6.0,"I was curious about this film as many people seemed angry about the trailer that this seemed to be a female inbetweeners kinda film but went extremely dark, I watched it last night and can't help but feel torn on it.Whilst it felt really natural almost like a documentary on itv2 the characters were slightly on the harder to like side to start but you warm to them especially Tara, who seems genuinely young and immature.The two incidents of attacks, were believable and natural rather than an aggressive style you'd see in darker films, it was clever to do it that way, to show that there are levels to it.Whilst I hate how many people volunteer to get into states where they lack control with alcohol it is part of society, but I'm still amazed when smoking gets so much attention, drinking which causes more crime/damage/death gets little attention.What ruined it from being an important film was the ending, where a quick chat seemed to undo it's impact on her, personally think it should've ended on a sad note as potentially these incidents are life ruining.

But then it does get interesting, or rather exciting, concerning the only likeable person (and the only at least mediocre actress). A script trick then? Well, maybe I'm reading too much into it, unfortunately the suspense only lasts a quarter of an hour. Not that kind of film after all. But what then? The question marks certainly keep you on the edge of your seat. Another dramatic element only flares up briefly. And yet another is the final chord and rounds off the film to some extent. The overall concept is relatively coherent and not a bad film experience, one about toxic characters, parallel worlds, real feelings, a superficial waste of time, you only live once, but you only live once. After two or three years of enforced diversity, we can slowly draw a small interim conclusion. The numerous female filmmakers who have suddenly come out of nowhere have undoubtedly enriched the cinematic world, even if only by producing a plethora of mediocre films."

Oliver wants Poirot to expose Yeoh as a fraud or start believing in the afterlife. He attends and there is a murder.Branagh's third go at a Poirot story and depending on your fondness for these things, potentially the best. It is very different from the previous 2 mysteries in that whilst the usual interviews and ripping up of alibis takes place, there is a very distinct supernatural element here, which may or may not be real. What Branagh does though is use this to create a much darker and decidedly well crafted spooky story (he should definitely make a straight ghost story) which is looking both for a murderer and proof that the ghostly bit is true or false. So whilst the gloss and usual extravagant beautifully dressed characters might be missing there is still a great mystery to enjoy. I hope he does another one."

The film looks authentic and gorgeous, as opposed to its predecessors that were over reliant on unnecessary CGI backgrounds.The story does have some interesting ideas and compelling character interactions, but they unfortunately take a back seat half the time. For the other half, we get a lot of weak attempts at horror and red herring plot points that really do amount to nothing.I don't know what happened with the performances, but half of them are pretty great and the others are...well, awful. The actors clearly didn't agree on what kind of movie they were in, with some thinking it ought to be straight drama and others thinking they should play it corny.Like the previous films, this is a middling whodunnit, with all the rote machinations you expect from the genre, nothing shocking, nothing gripping, but nothing so bad as to tank the experience.It's the definition of mediocre."
tt22687790,6.0,"My Review- A Haunting in Venice
My Rating 6/10I was underwhelmed by Kenneth Branagh's latest interpretation of an Agatha Christie novel this one is based on her 1969 novel Halloween Party .It was written late in the authors life to luke warm reviews one critic Robert Weaver wrote - Halloween Party is a disappointment,but with all her accomplishments is Christie can be forgiven some disappointments Poirot seems weary and so does the book.It was filmed previously in 2010 for television starring my favourite Hercule Poirot David Suchet which I watched only after seeing A Haunting in Venice.I must admit Kenneth Branagh who I like in some roles and not others is my least favourite characterisation of Hercule Poirot.His first effort in 2017 Murder on the Orient Express also underwhelmed me but did exceedingly well at the box office however his last effort in 2022 Death on the Nile flopped and for me also had nothing of the grandeur or appeal of the original film adaptations.All that needs to said about the plot line in this whodunnit is that Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot investigates a murder while attending a Halloween seance at a haunted palazzo in Venice, Italy.I was expecting more from this new original adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel Halloween Party that's set in the mysterious and spectacular city of Venice because it's a story I didn't know and I had no preconceived expectations.Spectacular Venice is featured in the start and conclusion of this film but it's mostly set indoors in a gloomy gothic villa that could have been built on any movie set.A Haunting in Venice for me fails in a few aspects primarily because of its dark gothic reworking from Kenneth Branagh. It's probably his best Hercule Poirot performance but for me his interpretation of the novel lacks The Agatha Christie touch of humour, eccentric characters and is trying to be something it's not a gothic horror movie it's not really scary at all just dark and brooding.After I saw this movie I watched the 2010 television movie Hallowe'en Party starring David Suchet my favourite Hercule Poirot that bares no resemblance to A Haunting in Venice . It's not her greatest story but the television version has humour and lightness as well as suspense and the performances are much more impressive in my opinion.There are some interesting actors in the cast of A Haunting in Venice including Michelle Yeoh who dropped out of The action adventure 2024 film The Electric State to star in this movie. Why she chose to do this I'm not sure because her role as the clairvoyant Mrs Reynolds is more a short cameo role as is Jamie Dornan's who plays Dr Ferrier .The main supporting role is Tina Fey as Ariadne Oliver a crime writer but she didn't shine for me either. Tina Fey plays a similar role in Only Murders in the Building as Cinda Canning but that role is edgy and funny which she does best .With a much more modest production budget of $60 million than his last Agatha Christie move Death in Venice Kenneth Branagh who also directs this movie in my view features himself as Poirot more at the expense of the ensemble characters which is a mistake in an Agatha Christie movie."
tt22687790,5.0,"Very far from a horror, and a mid whodunnit. Opened with a jump scare, was hoping that wasn't gonna be all that the movie is about; there's a few but the movie isn't a horror by any means. It is set in post world war Italy, it's mentioned several times throughout the movie as the characters grapple with consequences of postwar era.The movie lacks the eerie atmosphere commonly found in horror films because, in reality, it's more of a murder mystery in the Poirot franchise. I personally think it missed the mark. It's not supernatural either, although that theme plays an important role in the movie, influencing some of the characters' actions and personalities. I wished it had a scarier rating than PG-13. It felt more like a spooky campfire story told with proper Victorian language, largely due to the extensive narration. The dialogue itself was decent and had a certain wit without feeling forced.While the cast gave decent performances, there wasn't much they could do to elevate the movie. It reminded me of the sentiment expressed in ""See How They Run (2022)"" that if you've seen one whodunnit film, you've seen them all, and this film seemed to confirm that. The camera work, perhaps due to the IMAX viewing, felt shaky, and the edges of the screen often appeared blurry.The story itself wasn't particularly engaging, and when the mystery was finally unraveled, it didn't have a strong climax. The plot twists were just okay, and they couldn't make up for the shortcomings of the underlying story. I found it hard to become invested in the movie or its characters, so I didn't care much about how everything unfolded. This film was advertised as a horror but ended up being a mediocre whodunnit with a few jump scares, failing to excel at being interesting in either genre."
tt29722855,6.0,"The latest Hong Kong actioner or the latest Don Lee trademark, that was the question beforehand. The good news: both. When he dominates the screen, the place rocks, as usual. But that's where the euphoria ends. ""When he dominates the screen"" is unfortunately not in the usual or desired rhythm. The post-apocalypse is, of course, based on pure CGI in the latest fast-paced filming, obviously. The story is rather hare-brained, nothing new, no aha effect. A half-baked mix of end times, dystopia, action, mad scientist, zombie horror, mutant horror and comedy elements. Half of the actors indulge in overacting. After all, such a crude mixture has a way of not being boring. And the gorehounds are also treated to a few brutal gore, especially in the finale. All in all, a can, not a must."
tt29722855,5.0,"While I give the film a 5, I'm not sure if it should be that high. I watched it and didn't fast forward and that is a good sign. They didn't laden the film with too much subtext so the plot moves along fairly quickly. Yet it didn't offer anything that we've not seen before.But that moving of the plot along also made the movie oddly disjointed with chunks of the story left unanswered or touched on very briefly. Things like:
*Why did an earthquake in one area destroy so much of the world? And that scene happened so fast and there was no explanation. And then suddenly we were in the future.*After that kind of earthquake, why wouldn't people be out in rural areas for farming.*A crocodile?*How did the two hunters catch up to the same area where grandmother was killed? If the group left as early as implied then they'd have had a great head start.*The ending comes as fast as the beginning. Just a passing reference to ""staying here and rebuilding"" and the visit to the grave. They could have added a few more minutes to show us the repercussions.*What is ""mister's"" background? Everyone seems to know him.""How did he save the girl before? That's just dropped on us.*Where is all the security? Three people, one of whom is not a fighter, were able to break in and take out all the security. You'd think roaming gangs would have been able to do that to get access to the water.*And really, rain at the last moment?The acting wasn't bad but still fairly average. I liked some of the actors playing bit parts as parents more than some of the main characters. I like Ma Dong-seok in the few things I've seen him in and he did well but he's not the kind of actor that I see carrying out this role - even though I know he has a martial arts background.So it's worth a watch but just put your brain in a holding pattern."
tt29722855,5.0,"Ma Dong-Seok is one of my favorite action stars, almost on par with Jason Statham in my books in terms of entertainment value. His work is usually very enjoyable (the badass punches in Round-up 2, some of the best I've ever seen) action + humor, like almost nobody else.I was really looking fwd to Badland Hunters, but this turned out to be a let down. The plot is these action movies isn't usually anything new but this had a bunch of stuff going on that didn't add any value...? Action for the sake of it....tsk.That said, others seem to like it, for a mix of all sorts of action. If you have nothing else to watch, maaaybe check it out? I'd much rather rewatch some of his older content."
tt29722855,6.0,"Korean Entertainment Industry is BAWAAL itself . It's not make movies or dramas it's make Emotions It's a pretty entertaining sequel to a recent quality film. Badland Hunters is a passable futuristic, sci-fi thriller purporting to star Don lee aka Ma Dong-seok. It is part post-apocalyptic version of ""The Last of Us"" with Zombies, and tribal interest but not as good. The story and setting are decent. Don Lee is always good, but underutilized here. The cast is decent. It lacks the normal humor that accompanies a Don Lee movie. The movie is simple to follow. It has some decent special effects, costumes, make-up, and landscapes. The violence is plentiful and decent."
tt29722855,5.0,"A mad scientist is hellbent on reviving his dead daughter and his weird experiment is stopped mid way. At the same time, Seoul is brought down by an earthquake with a Richter scale reading of 5. With no fresh water, the city is on the verge of apocalypse and enter the Hunter who not only keeps the people fed but also protects them from the bounty Hunters and ofcourse more. When the mad scientist returns with his sinister plan, taking away the young children, he is not aware of how many punches the Hunter can throw.Badland Hunters succeed in terms of providing enough human punch bags to Don Lee. The ordinary vfx isn't really a hurdle in the proceedings and he quickly gets into business, starting with a crocodile. The story however has nothing new to offer and is as silly as one expects it to be, which could've been deemed Gold in the 80s but in 2024, one can be happy for Don Lee's screen presence to even make this bland film to entertain slightly. The runtime also helps as there is not too much space for melodrama and the makers seems to be aware of what their true strength is in so the film gets into action mode quickly and stays that way throughout."

tt29722855,6.0,"Really fun, even though nothing new!At first, i did not get really excited because it is a Netflix work, and most of their work are really bad last period of time. But, i have seen parents guide and i found it is clear from nudity, which is something really rare these days.It was somehow fun, i enjoyed it.What makes this movie fun?Well, there are multiple things i really liked. First, the good acting. Second, the exciting action scenes. Third, not that bad plot, and unfortunately it could be better.And Finally, it was clear without any filler or useless scenes, and i did not fell the time pass.What are it cons?The same theme of the korean movies, i did not find anything new in the plot. The CGI and effects was not that so good, but acceptable. That all i guess."
tt29722855,6.0,"Technically a spin off of the Korean blockbuster Concrete Utopia but offers a completely standalone viewing experience with mighty Dong Lee onboard what else one could ask for...Badland Hunters serves as the directorial debut of Lee's long-time stunt coordinator Heo myeong who does prove his ability...Action movie fans can confidently add Badland Hunters to their platter. With a strong serving of Don Lee's signature punches, ultraviolent zombie action with usual commercial so called cliches despite these formulae the film never fails to impress...The production values were fairly high though some of the destroyed city sets looked familiar from other dramas and movies set in the dry ruins of post apocalyptic korea...Overall Badland Hunters won't be remembered for its riveting plot but when you have Ma Dong Seok swinging his mighty fists and a giant machete it really doesn't matter..."
tt29722855,5.0,"But dont sparkle,,, the story is the weak link in this chain , its just a bit strange and it is something childish over it aswell, kind of a story for the younger ones , and perhaps it isActing is good ,,, its very korean of course, lots of dramatic flipmoves , production is good , and in many ways its just a total ok movie, entertaining with comedy and action so not so much to complain on except the story, its also a bit thin, they dont have so much to give and it feels alot of doing same things again and againBut yes , the movie is rolliing and you are ok with it , but I will not watch it again."
tt29722855,6.0,Yes I am actually fed up with the post apocalyptic movies and series. Actually I m fed up with these plots itself. As usual the movie starts with a calamity and a doctor trying to survive or help his sick daughter. Why the daughter is sick is not revealed but the calamity happens and at the same time militants arrest the doctor. After several years the world is suffering and hero becomes a alpha survivor. Same story right and a group trying to use the remaining people for some research and no government nor judicial. The plot moves with the hero invading to the research facility and what research is done and who is the villain here and the story atleast ends with some positive scene. The full movie is action based and lot of zombie kind of scenes and one more in this kind - nothing special. I m just happy that the movie is available in Tamil.
tt29722855,6.0,"""Badland Hunters: A Visually Striking Action Spectacle with Narrative Shortcomings""In this post-apocalyptic action thriller, Badland Hunters, while suffering from a repetitive and clichéd plot and uninteresting characters, excels in stunning hand-to-hand choreography and scintillating action set pieces. The film benefits greatly from the expertise of its veteran stunt coordinator turned director, known for his work on Train to Busan. Commendable world-building, visionary concepts, and excellent VFX are hindered by conventional writing. The short, crisply edited runtime avoids unnecessary elements. Don Lee's exceptional portrayal of Nam-san, with exhilarating action sequences, overshadows the film's narrative weaknesses, making it a guiltily satisfying popcorn-worthy entertainer, particularly for adrenaline enthusiasts.Instagram & X @streamgenx."
tt18925334,6.0,"Pearl (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows a young lady in 1918 who lives on a farm with her handicapped father and over burdened mother and whose husband is off at war. The young lady has delusions of grandeur and feels she should be a movie star and far away from her farm. Her family needs her to stay and help with chores and keep them alive. When there's tryouts for a traveling dance team she plans to audition whether her family wants her to or not.This movie is directed by Ti West (Them) and stars Mia Goth (A Cure for Wellness), David Corenswet (The Politician), Emma Jenkins-Purro (The Brokenwood Mysteries), Matthew Sunderland (The Lost City of Z) and Tandi Wright (Jack the Giant Slayer).The cinematography in this movie is outstanding, as is the attire, depiction of the era and the performance of Mia Goth (who co-wrote and produced this movie with West). This is more of a character piece with horror elements than a traditional horror movie. There's elements that worked for me and scenes that left me scratching my head. I will say I was very frustrated watching this movie. Every scene with the alligator was awesome. There's a pitchfork scene, fight with the mother and explosion I adored. The father was also a solid, creepy character (the bath scenes made me cringe). However, the movie feels like it is trying too hard to prove Pearl is insane. The scarecrow scene felt rediculous and didn't work for me. How people reacted to her behavior at times felt off (they tolerated her uncomfortably long). The monologue scene was great acting but felt unrealistic from the sister in-law's perspective. The ending was sudden and I wanted more.Overall, there's things to like about this movie and components that dragged and was overdone. I would score this a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it once."
tt18925334,6.0,"Pearl is feeling rather trapped, it's 1918 and she struggles to adapt, with an overbearing mother, immobile father she'd like to smother, it all makes her feel encaged, and somewhat handicapped. A projectionist has opened up her eyes, to a world that's full of wonder and surprise, no longer can she prolong, she needs to snare life with a prong, set the world alight, go out and fight, and learn to dance along. Alas a pearl is often formed from bits of grit, which can irritate and make you curse and spit, bring your demons to the fore, compound monotony of chore, revealing attributes you'd rather not admit."
tt18925334,5.0,"This was Pearl's origin story, thought it'd span out over a few years but it's just a short period of her upbringing. It was tough one as you'd expect from a 'horror' origin story, her mother was cruel but she was raising her the only way she knew how. I think it's better than X in a way because it has purpose and is really all about character development to help us understand how they lady in X came to be. Mia Goth did a stellar job in this, more noticeable because she had a lot more to do which allowed her to show her acting skills. What I liked about it was it wasn't an exuberant display, she seemed like a believable level of crazy and messed up.But it has the same problem as X which is a big one, it's not a horror, once again horror movies are meant to be scary and this isn't. There were actually very few scenes where the characters were frightened for a prolonged period of time so how do they expect the audience to feel the fear. None of the characters had time to sulk in their fear because once Pearl unveils herself they're killed off pretty quickly. It's a very calm movie, taking time to reveal the next parts of the plot. You could literally walk out the theatre for a short bathroom break or snacks and not miss out on anything.Being set during the Spanish Flu made it also feel like a Covid pick me, they've been one too many pandemic films to keep making them, I thought that time had passed now. Production quality and cinematography was the same as X, sorta unique as it's gritty retro picture like it was recorded on an old camera. I hate how the blood just looked like cheap watery tomato ketchup.Probably sound like a broken record because once again here's another movie that isn't a horror, throwing in some gore scenes or grotesque deaths doesn't make it one. The more movies like this are made and labeled horror the more the genre loses it's essence. Was anyone even scared while watching this? The most eerie thing about this was the smile in the end credits. It was a good enough story for an origin story, just not a horror. Feels more like a family drama."
tt18925334,5.0,"I already saw X the movie with that Pearl character is on this movie. So now we see Pearl and in what family she growns with: a father who is disabled and cant take care of himself, a mother really strict and have a certain autority on Pearl. And Pearl is one of the girl who wants her freedom and do something big like the dance stuff and to be a star. Like in her dream. We will see also a weird behavior from her with her dad (thougnt about drowning him). Pearl will get some friend who will helped her but that girl is too sensitive and will really be violent at multiple times. And be self centered always. So Pearl will kill her new boyfriend, the sister in law too (because she gets a job that she wanted). I mean we just see a girl who really just selfish and when things dont turn in her advantage she becomes really angry and thats all. I mean the performance of the actor of Pearl is great but really superficial and i didnt really get into that character and clearly lacked of psychological mechanism(except the autority of her mother and stuff like this). I just felt that the movie was just an excuse to make some violent scenes and to use the characters to make Pearl justified the violence. Really superficial and boring in my opinion."
tt1441395,6.0,"Until I read someone's explanation of the opening of the movie, there was no way I was going to understand it. It culminated in an eye (which I kind of anticipated). Beyond that, I was clueless, but knew that I was in for an ""interesting"" 90 minutes.One review I read elsewhere stated, ""If you want to see Scarlett Johansson drive around in a van for 90 minutes... go for it!"" While not entirely inaccurate as far as reviews go, it's not all she does in the movie. Having been disappointed again and again by her acting, it made perfect sense to cast her as an emotionless alien predator. In many ways, this is just another take on the vampire genre. It has sci-fi elements scattered about the place, but it's mostly a beautiful exposition of early spring-time Scotland and a terrible characterization of Scottish people.Almost entirely devoid of language, barring the odd, ""Do you have a girlfriend?"" or, ""I'm trying to get to the M8,"" it relies almost entirely on imagery and action to tell the story.Having said that, you may be fooled into thinking that I didn't like the movie at all. I actually enjoyed it. I ""got"" the plot without any problems, though a reading of the novel would definitely fill in some gray areas. But I can't get over the idea that a lot of the plot went on in Scarlett's character's head. Her ultimate empathy for the human race and her desperate bid to break free of her ghoulish task are only partly explained.All in all, not enough plot to cover the time allotted, but I didn't feel scammed or that I'd entirely wasted my time. But definitely not a ""redefining of what it means to be human"" as one reviewer put it.I also have to note that my television turned itself off about halfway through. That's never happened before. Was it trying to tell me something?"
tt15791034,6.0,"UGH .... so close - SO CLOSE! But in the end, no cigar. All that potential and solid storytelling dissolving into to a nonsensical, clumsy, rushed, and ultimately unsatisfying conclusion, implementing all of the worst elements of horror movies. That's what disappoints the most. This movie held so much promise and had such a great start and journey all the way up until the end, but sadly the writer(s) somehow couldn't find the way to keep that strong storytelling up to par all the way through to the end. It wasn't that I disliked the end result. It was the clumsy way the screenplay got us there that left a lot to be desired. I was rolling my eyes on multiple occasions during parts of the final act. Video review to come soon."
tt15791034,6.0,"This movie has A LOT of positive traits. The plot is interesting and there are some genuinely scary details in it. Unfortunately the plot is also very scattered, some of the choice do not make sense and the further the plot developers, the weirder it all gets.The beginning is actually very good. You don't know what is going on, it's fascinating to find out what is going on. The acting is great, Bill Skarsgård is one of my favorite actor and it was a nice surprise to see him in this. But when Justin Long comes to the picture, the plot loses the intense feeling and the threat. Long's character is way over the top and all the way through his character and intentions do not make sense. They force this #MeToo plot point in the story and it bring the story down quite a bit.There are some genuine scary moments in this, and even though I am a horror addict and seen some scary stuff, this movie manages to frighten me a few times. If they had managed to keep the story more coherent and intact, it would've been a better experience.The last 20 minutes are just bad. I have heard some bad things about American cops but in this movie they do not seem even human and it's weird. The water tower scene is actually bad and Justin Long's character ruins it for good.It's very frustrating to see great potential in something and then see it wasted. First half is a solid 8 and the second half is 5 at best. It's 6,5 average, but I'm lowering in to 6 because of the wasted potential."
tt15791034,6.0,"Barbarian features a warped premise that could have been amazingly terrifying and unique, but which doesn't quite click, despite a decent cast and solid direction from Zach Cregger, who also wrote the film. I think my issue is that the basic set-up offers opportunities to go to some seriously dark and twisted places, but the final product only goes part of the way.Georgina Campbell plays Tess, who books an Airbnb in Detroit so that she can attend a job interview; however, when she arrives in what appears to be very bad neighbourhood, the property is already occupied by a young man, Keith (Bill Skarsgård), who claims that he has also rented the house. With nowhere else to go, Tess accepts Keith's offer for her to stay the night. Tension and uneasiness is established, Keith's behaviour seemingly off.Keith, as it turns out, isn't the danger, for unbeknownst to either of the occupants, hidden behind a secret door in the cellar is a network of rooms and passageways, home to a hideous inbred mutant mother who captures people to keep as her 'babies'.That sounds messed up, and it is, but Cregger's script doesn't fully exploit it's potential. At it's weirdest, disgraced Hollywood actor AJ (Justin Long), owner of the house, is forced to suckle from the mutant mother's breast (Long sure picks 'em!), but I wanted much more from the film: the mother should have been seen putting AJ in a diaper, spooning disgusting food into his mouth, putting him in a cradle etc. AJ is such a slimeball that he deserves to suffer more.I would also have liked to have seen more of the backstory: a flashback shows weirdo Frank (Richard Brake) preparing for the birth of one of his children by shopping for baby goods, but the film glosses over how he abducted women and used them to bear his kids in his underground lair, and how these children grew up to have more children, until the result was the deformed mutant we see in the film. The comparisons to Josef Fritzl are interesting and it would have been good to have seen them explored further.However, when all is said and done, Barbarian is still a fun ride, with plenty of atmosphere, another enjoyable turn from Long, a great 'creature', and a bit of gore, so I doubt horror fans will come away disappointed. I just wanted it to be crazier.6/10."
tt15791034,5.0,"What would you do, your Airbnb has two, when you arrive someone is there, a double booking, would you just share? Would you put yourself in danger, with a complete and total stranger, perhaps enjoy a glass of wine, would you really cross that line?This is a film that won't test your full cognition, if you found you were in a similar scenario or situation, not just at the start when the choices might be limited, but later when you find yourself in places quite inhibited.This could have been a spectacular piece of film making but there are far too many tangents, dangling ends and nonesensicals, defying the laws of physics was the least of them."
tt16304446,5.0,"Man, this is a tough one to digest. I really liked the concept, and the story up to a point, but then it careens off the rails, and becomes something altogether different. By the end, it has taken one of the leads into a place that is barely believable, and borderline absurd. I guess it is possible that some relationships could go this route, but it's almost hard to accept that the two people that start out this movie can possibly devolve into the couple at the end.The dialogue is solid, the feel for the world of finance is legit... I should know, I was in it. And while Luke's overwhelming job-envy and bitterness is palpable, heartbreaking and brutal, the ending just went too far. The meltdown, the party, the bathroom, the final scene... neither of these two people should ever have gotten near this. I'm all for ""girl power"" but IMO, the last 30:00 became unfathomably mean-spirited, and wrecked this film for me. Sorry. An ""8"" for the acting and the beginning and a ""2"" for what they did to a promising premise, and we'll call it a ""5"" and be done with it. Ouch."
tt16304446,5.0,"I think a lot of reviewers misunderstand this film. It's not about corporate politics although that's in there by default. It's not about paranoia. It's about how a loss in traditional balance sends a couple into their dark side. Shakespeare is the first to use the phrase Turnabout is Fair Play. At times i thought it might be a Fatal attraction type ending, thus my title, but the ending is about how Emily has found her voice and asserts herself after realizing the man of her dreams was willing to destroy her career as his own ship was sinking. I think a lot of women might appreciate the ending where Emily is not only not a victim and not a people pleaser but has taken a step across a line that traditionally represents how a man might risk himself to make a point. Personally, I didn't find it that edgy or novel but I'm not young and I've seen couples act very similar in real life. Some reviews think Luke intentionally sabatoged her as the PM but I believe that segment was really about how Emily was being too influenced by Luke which paved the way for her to learn that the firm didn't think highly of Luke. I also disagree that it's about paranoia or jealousy. It's not uncommon for men to jump when the boss calls, so this is about that reverse of tradition here, too, and Luke finds himself in a position that women have traditionally found themselves in, growing tired of being 2nd place. It's a film about how the eager passion of a modern me-me couple turned from hot to dangerous when their immaturity was under such enormous stress. It's also about how a female who was willing to be more timid suddenly had a taste of power and what she was willing to do to prove her worth. Hopefully, it's also a message to parents to not push your plans on your kids when they tell you it's a bad time. Some call it a slowburn but I would reserve that term for something much more shocking. This is a character study more than a thriller. The actors did a good job. It isn't on my not recommended list but its definitly not on my list of films to own."
tt16304446,5.0,"It's a collapsing-relationship movie set in the present time in New York City. It follows the relationship of a newly engaged couple who both work as analysts at a high-stress hedge fund firm.Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) become engaged at the wedding of Luke's brother (Buck Braithwaite). They both work at First Capital, run by a crass, in-your-face Campbell (Eddie Marsan). Company policy does not allow co-workers to be in a relationship, but Emily and Luke have lived together secretly for two years. Suddenly, one of the portfolio managers at the firm has a psychotic break, resulting in an opening for a highly lucrative position. Rumor suggests that Luke is in line, but the promotion goes to Emily, who is obviously the better analyst.""Fair Play"" follows the changes and struggles in their relationship that gradually deteriorate as the power balance shifts and ends in a violent climax.Dynovor and Ehrenreich give intense performances, but I found the script only marginally believable. How does one hide an office romance for two years in a work setting that often abuses alcohol and drugs? The setting for the final confrontation felt artificial. It felt like the two main characters took turns gaslighting each other as they approached psychosis."
tt16304446,5.0,"First of all, it's incredibly distracting that it's NOT actually filmed in NYC but in Serbia. I literally had to pause the movie and look up the filming location within the first 10 minutes or so, because the entire ""feel"" of the movie was NOT New York, and I wondered, ""Are they supposed to be living somewhere overseas? But everyone has American accents..."" It's amazing how unique NYC's entire energy is, that you can't really copy it by filming elsewhere. So, the whole film had an otherworldly feel to it, and that bugged me.On to the plot: I was engaged for the most part, and wanted to see what was going to happen. The acting was good. By the time we got to the final scene, though, I was just underwhelmed. It needed a twist, or it needed to have gone much, much deeper into the characters' inner lives. It was kind of like a cross between a character-driven film and a plot-driven film, but neither of those was strong enough to give it the ""oomph"" it needed to make it a great film.I read someone's review that they said the ending was what every power woman dreams of or something. What?? No. I'm a woman who is successful career-wise, and I don't relate to the female lead character at all (okay, maybe a little bit professionally, but not in her relationship with her fiancee). In fact, I would have just dumped the guy after he started pouting incessantly due to my promotion. I couldn't understand why the character wasted her time with him, and I found it tedious.That character is also annoyingly terrible at communicating with her mother. The way she lets herself be led around by her is BEYOND annoying. I'm in my 50s and I wouldn't have ever let my mother do what her mother did... (hint: call off the unasked-for party like a grown-up!). How would a younger woman in today's world let that kind of 1950s behavior go on? It just doesn't make sense.Overall, the movie was still entertaining. A decent effort and not a total waste of time. But it could have been SO much more, and left me kind of wondering, ""What was the point of this movie?"""
tt16304446,5.0,"The pair to compartmentalize their personal and work lives to some extent, but all hope of keeping work and love separate goes wrong when she receives a promotion he thought he was going to get. This is not the erotic thriller Netflix's algorithm so desperately would like it to be. There is sex, yes, and a psychological duel, but not so much perverse desire. It's ultimately an ugly film. Fair Play is about the sort of guy a lot of women are uncomfortably familiar with - the one who's perfect until he's not, who's an ally as long as he stays in power. It's about the sort of woman other women dread to become, the one who realises her own power is illusory only when it's far too late. Both the lead actors deliver good performances but in my opinion you don't know where the whole story is going.."
tt16304446,5.0,"From trailers, the viewer knows what themes to expect from this movie. But unfortunately, a complete movie has to be about more than male fragility and office gender politics. On that surface level, it does well. There is a well paced slow burn of tension and passive-aggressiveness throughout the picture. However, there are too many insurmountable obstacles to this being a fully realized film.First, there are arguably no sympathetic characters. We as the audience, I suspect, are meant to resonate with the two leads, but it fell flat for me. Young investment professionals on the come are just a hard pass for me (unless the story is a come-to-Jesus tale about leaving the money-grubbing life and learning to become a real person... but alas, that is not this story). I'll give credit that the filmmaker did give complexity to the main characters, their ambitions and their insecurities, particularly Emily, portraying each in less than flattering lights. But it never made me connect with them. In particular was the, what might be called Tom Cruise plot armor for Emily. Put in a challenging situation, but the wunderkind can prevail in the end. (Perhaps a better example would be the Sidney Poitier effect... having an actor carry the burden of a fantastical excellence as a representative for an entire demographic group).The actors did grew on me as the movie progressed, but tended to lose a lot of that goodwill with some egregious overacting in later stages. Alden Ehrenreich was serviceable as Luke, in portraying emotional reactions (for most of the film, anyway). Phoebe Dynevor, as Emily, was equally appealing at first. But unfortunately, as happens all too often it seems, a Brit with a listless American accent gnaws away. (Full disclosure... I KNOW this is on me, it's the audience's responsibility to suspend disbelief... but when you know something is just off, it distracts...I think, maybe the character is not who they claim to be? Or is it just the actor? Only after I'd watched the film, I checked IMDb and confirmed).I think there was a better film hidden away somewhere in this story. A glimpse of it may have been in a scene later in the film. A scene obliquely reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs. (Anyone familiar with the most controversial scene in that film, with Susan George, can immediately understand). It's touched upon later, almost as an afterthought, but would have been a much more interesting avenue to pursue regarding the main characters' relationship."
tt16304446,6.0,"Regarding the movie, I can say that the depiction of the ruthlessness of the finance sector and the approach to advancement through sexual desires was quite fitting and balanced. It had one of the most original scripts I've seen in recent years, and the casting was of high quality as well. However, I was disappointed with how predictably everything was wrapped up at the end. Let's solve everything, everyone finds their way, Luke starts his own company, Emily satisfies her ego, and they compete. Is this really how real life works? I don't think so, definitely not.I read a couple of comments about overacting, and I agree with some points, but I don't think it's solely the fault of the actors; I believe it's because of the script. While some parts of the movie did portray the role of sexuality in ego battles quite accurately, I found the illogical sexual scene towards the end unnecessary. Up to that point, everything related to sexuality was well-placed, but that scene seemed utterly meaningless.It had all the elements of a thriller, it was original, but it was definitely wrapped up in a mediocre way. The real world is much more ruthless. If someone is about to confront someone else to the point of physical aggression, they don't just throw a glass and walk out of the room politely, because that would mean sinking to the level of someone who lacks humanity.Also, that engagement party part seemed like it was written in about three minutes. I wish more thought had been put into it, and that it had continued with more probing dialogues, instead of ending with a focus on sexuality.Let me share my own opinion as well; people mistakenly think that being ambitious is a good thing, but ambition poisons and corrupts everyone. Associating concepts like hard work and effort with ambition and presenting them as if they go hand in hand makes me sick. Ambition is a quality that needs to be cleansed, while appreciation is a quality that needs to increase. Be a good person, don't be Emily or Luke."
tt16304446,5.0,"Saw this at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival""Fair Play"" is a story about an unexpected promotion at a cutthroat hedge fund pushes a young couple's relationship to the brink, threatening to unravel far more than their recent engagement. Director Chloe Domont clearly takes influence on stress tension storytelling films like Uncut Gems, Shiva Baby and so on and the film does offer some strong aspects.The performances from the main two leads were pretty great as emotions of all sorts were able to be exposed from their faces, voice, and body language. The camerawork, production designs, and soundtrack also provided strong tones and energy to the narrative. For the most part, I did enjoy the tension filled atmosphere and the clash between men vs women. But unfortunately, those aspects are overshadowed with characters that were hard to fully be invested with.The narrative aspects seem interesting but the formula it takes feels pretty tame at times and it doesn't feel as impactful as it wants to be. The characters are pretty unbearable and I know that's the intentions of the filmmaker but they weren't investing and I struggled to really connect with any of them. The style and pacing of the film feels like it took too much influence on films like ""Uncut Gems"".There are some good dialogue moments but some of the dialogue did feel a bit forced. Pacing didn't have any issues. The climax scene was pretty cringy to be honest.Overall, it's a film that I can see many will be enjoying it but it didn't fully work with me.Rating: C+"
tt7130916,5.0,"Whether you'll enjoy this movie depends on how much you enjoy way, way over the top musicals with very adult themes. Pretty clearly the creators behind this story of 'identical twins' who are complete dicks that seek to get their estranged parents together are not aiming for mainstream success. This film is very much meant to be a cult classic along the lines of Rocky Horror Picture Show.Personally, I found this film to be a lot funnier than RHPS. Its music though, is not near as good. Megan The Stallion's contribution not withstanding there is no number here that is as memorable as Time Warp.Also, how funny you find the picture truly depends on how seriously you take it. I was not especially shocked by the situation the films heroes find themselves in at the pictures end but then I never bought they were ever brothers so wasn't troubled by their behavior. Others might not be able to let that plot twist off the hook.In any case, I laughed more than I did not laugh which makes this flick enough of a success in my book."
tt10365998,5.0,"I saw ""Infinity Pool"" last night in the theatre. It is a very strange movie directed by Brandon Cronenberg, the son of David Cronenberg (""Videodrome"", ""The Fly"", etc.) It is about a couple (Alexander Skarsgård and Cleopatra Coleman) who travel to a luxury resort in a repressive dictatorship. They meet another couple (Jalil Lespert and Mia Goth) who convince them to travel off the grounds of the resort, even though it is prohibited by the rules of the resort and country. Soon a tragedy occurs, and the couple is thrust into a fever dream of drugs, sex and violence. Mia Goth is excellent as the temptress who pushes Skarsgård's character into doing things he would never think of doing. Skarsgård is wasted in this role and his character takes actions that defy common sense. And while some have praised Brandon Cronenberg's direction - I found some of the strange angles and quirks he uses to be more annoying than ingenious. There is a surfeit of sex, violence and gore for those who enjoy that, but I cannot say that it really added anything to a convoluted plot that really makes no sense. Only recommended for Mia Goth's standout performance - wait for cable or Netflix on this one. 5/10."
tt10365998,5.0,"James Foster is a one-novel author struggling with writer's block. He and his wife Em are vacationing at a resort on the idyllic, isolated isle of Li Tolqa, where their marital woes cause constant arguments. After meeting Gabi, a fan of his novel, and her husband Alban, James and Em venture outside the boundaries of the resort, where the two couples enjoy a drunken day of sunbathing. However, their dream vacation soon turns into a nightmare after an accident occurs, plunging James into a dark underworld of debauchery and excess. As he battles a twisted justice system, a bizarre cult and his own deepest fears, will James escape, or be trapped on the island ad infinitum?Written and directed by Brandon Cronenberg, 'Infinity Pool' is an ambitious, headily atmospheric psychological horror that doesn't quite go the distance. Initially intriguing, then frustrating, and finally exasperating, the screenplay tries to balance too many different elements, failing at nearly all of them. Though the film tries to explore some interesting themes of identity, morality and escapism, they are not fully developed or resolved; coming across as rather half-baked.Additionally, the surreal seediness of the first act- which draws one in brilliantly- does not sit well with the rote science fiction and action-oriented elements of the last two. A cloning sub-plot is both poorly explained and executed, and the denouement is anticlimactic and cliched. Cronenberg's characterisation is rather shallow, to boot, and the main character is largely unsympathetic. James is neither likable nor relatable, and his motivations and actions are often illogical and inconsistent.With 'Infinity Pool', Cronenberg has created a surreal and distinct world, but fails to do anything interesting with it narratively. Conversely, the film is a visual delight, boasting striking cinematography from Karim Hussain, who uses analog methods in a digital medium to create its disturbing, dreamlike visual style. Hussain also employs unusual framing and lenses to express James' emotional turmoil, as well as the duality between the paradise-like resort and the hellish underworld of the island. 'Infinity Pool' is stunning, with vibrant colours, rich textures and grand compositions drawing the viewer into Cronenberg's horrific environment.Furthermore, Tim Hecker's score adds to the film's eerie and unsettling atmosphere, and James Vandewater's editing is continuously adept. 'Infinity Pool' also boasts a fine central performance from Alexander Skarsgård, who makes the most out of Cronenberg's scant characterisation of James. Mia Goth also does strong work as the seductive and mysterious Gabi, though her tendency for overacting- which made her so appealing in 'X' and 'Pearl'- hampers the impact of her performance somewhat.A disappointing waste of potential that leaves the viewer unsatisfied and confused, 'Infinity Pool' could- and probably should- have been much better than it is. Despite some interesting ideas and a strong first act, Cronenberg's narrative is unengaging and familiar. Though the cinematography is consistently alluring, the film is not, and the commendable efforts of Alexander Skarsgård and Mia Goth do little to keep one's interest held. In the end, perhaps the best one can say about 'Infinity Pool' is that it doesn't go on forever."
tt10365998,5.0,"Infinity Pool, the latest from writer/director Brandon Cronenberg, focuses on James and Em Foster, on vacation to help James clear his head in order to attempt writing his second novel. James and Em meet and are guided by a mysterious couple also vacationing outside of the resort to find themselves stuck in a culture packed with sex, violence, and unimaginable terrors. After a fatal vehicular accident leaves them facing the wrath of local law enforcement, James and Em are faced with a decision: be executed for their crime or, if rich enough, watch themselves die. What results is a downward plunge into debauchery, murder, and desperation.Infinity Pool stars Alexander Skarsgård and Mia Goth. Fresh off his tilt as Amleth in 2022's The Northman, Skarsgård plays a very different character here. In Infinity Pool Skarsgård is James Foster, struggling writer married to Em Foster, daughter of a power publisher and the couple's breadwinner. An amenable guy, James is enjoying his vacation with Em at Lotoka, a beachside country. Skarsgård plays James with the air of a man a bit adrift in life, clinging onto Em as a comfortable life raft. As an actor used to playing characters with power (see: True Blood) or iron determination (Mute, The Northman), Skarsgård takes a surprising turn as a meek, easily-lead man. While the change of pace is refreshing, Skarsgård's portrayal of James is nothing noteworthy. His passable acting is enough to offset the insanity that is Mia Goth.Mia Goth as Gabi Bauer is trouble from the first moment she appears on screen until her final. A performance that starts unsettling before ramping up to completely unhinged, Goth milks every ounce of craziness she can from the script. While it's not always for the best (Goth has some truly questionable line readings in this), she's by far the overall best part of the movie. While her characterization is maddening, the motivations Cronenberg gives Gabi are nebulous at best. Thankfully, that's no fault of Goth's and when she shows up on screen, audiences are in for a treat.Written and directed by Brandon Cronenberg, Infinity Pool is the director's second outing after 2020's amazing debut, Possessor. Sadly, the sophomore slump is apparent in his second project, giving audience and body horror fans a lackluster followup that's unfocused and meandering. From a directing standpoint, Cronenberg is still sharp, delivering tension and suspense along with the cringe-inducing scenes the family is known for. Extreme closeups of mutilation, murder, and blood by the buckets (topped off with a cumshot in the film's first 30 minutes) will put moviegoers on their backfoot while being completely vulnerable to whatever could happen next. Cinematographer Karim Hussain, who also shot the beautiful Possessor, delivers on the goods again, providing a remarkable visual journey that James embarks upon. Cronenberg's choice to shoot Infinity Pool in Croatia, one of the planet's most beautiful countries, while mostly resisting the opportunity to display that beauty and instead focus on the grime and side streets is a commendable decision that lines up with tone of the movie.As a writer, after tackling the theme of identity loss in an increasingly technological world in Possessor, in Infinity Pool no such messages seem to exist outside of a general human desensitivity to death. The first act might be the story's strongest, developing characters and creating situations that will entice the audience to be locked in and attentive. Unfortunately in the second act turn, where everything starts to fall apart for James, is also where everything will fall apart for the audience. James' descent into depravity, while interesting to look at in a well executed montage of sex and psychedelics, ultimately leads to a chaotic story with little in the way of explanation or true resolution.Overall, Infinity Pool is a mess of a movie. Within that mess are hints at something good, possibly great, but Cronenberg seems to be too in love with the idea of creating something off kilter more than telling an actual story. Alexander Skarsgård's performance is passable as a man lost in hedonism, while Mia Goth's unhinged insanity somehow fluctuates between amazing and downright lousy. Lacking the usual amount of body horror audiences have come to expect from the name Cronenberg, this film instead chooses to skate by on its ambience, which doesn't always work in its favor."
tt10365998,5.0,"I walked into this movie knowing little to nothing other than Brandon Cronenberg was at the helm, and Mia Goth was staring. I heard it was artsy, and ""disturbing"" but that should've meant it was right up my alley. What I found out was that, while the film's acting + visuals + base story concept were good....it just felt a little underwhelming.Let's start with what was good. Like I said, the acting is pretty good from the two main leads. Mia Goth goes over the top, and Alexander Skarsgard goes more realistic and human, which is a good contrast. Visuals are pretty good, same with the sound. The story has a premise that will get you interested in the first 30 minutes, dealing with a rich resort and a local government that loves to clone. However, this is where it has problems.The story and characters are its biggest problem. They're not bad per se, but they are not are par with the rest of the film. I feel like the cronenbergs always have great ideas, but cannot execute on the characters and fleshing out of the story. You don't relate to the main character ""James"" all that much. I can sympathise with him, and I kinda liked him but it just wasn't enough. Same with Mia Goth, you never see why the way she is other than maybe inferences (stuff that would spoil the movie). It just needed a special something in the story department to top it off, but we don't get that.If you like these types of experimental and artsy movies, then I would recommend giving it a shot (you love it). However, if you're more of a casual movie goer, you can probably skip. Unless you wanna pop a couple edibles and have a very weird night. However, Avatar or Puss in Boots would probably give you a better experience in that department."
tt10365998,6.0,"This is a great film to get lost in, and experience the story and it's main character, Skarsgard. I do love original films, and early in the piece, it was so cool, not knowing where the film was going, but later on, in the last 40 minutes, we have moments of predicability. I found this a fun shock movie, where we have some scenes. Which are truly memorably bizarre, the final one, a scene of normality, staying in my mind the most. This is one of these films, that lingers in the memory, days after you see it. It has strobing. 180 degree turn shots, a daunting music score, cloning, and sexy Mia Goth, really playing her part to the hilt. One X rated sex shot we could of done without. Brandon Cronenberg (David's) has definitely created something originally appealing and engrossing, but it gets too ludiicrous and crazy in it's second half. Some of the bloodletting scenes, are pretty heavy. Definitely recommended, but be warned."

She is warm and captivating and appears honest in her performance. Captain America is on point and fits the Bill as the farmer better than you would think. He's a much better actor than most of us think he is . Just go all the way back to sunshine directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting , Slumdog millionaire, etc, ) where he did very well over 15 years ago. Check it out if your fan of thriller horror from a phenomenal English Director.This flick is good fluff, mostly family friendly, and a decent way to spend part of an evening. Its not grounded in anything remotely realistic ... but the leads are charming."

It's basic, fun, silly and over the topI was pleasantly surprised that it started pretty quick and kept up a good pace throughout the movie. The two leads have great chemistry and scenes don't feel too forced for the most part which is good.This kind of story is so recycled it could probably save climate change by now. Nonetheless, it kinda works no matter how absurd and cliche it is.I feel like everyone should know what they're getting into with this movie so just take it for what it is and you'll find it entertaining enough.Overall, 6/10 - It's cliche and doesn't try to be anything else. Action is decent enough with over the top scenes sprinkled throughout. And Ana and Chris bounce off each other well enough for people to have a bit of mindless fun with this movie."
tt15326988,6.0,"Ghosted wrestles with its tone as it decides whether it's a goofy rom-com or a more serious spy thriller. While very much in the vein of Knight and Day or The Killers, Ghosted doesn't stay committed to comedy throughout. The jokes come and go, with Chris Evans taking most of the comedy side and Ana de Armas taking most of the action. The tone might be conflicted, but the fun never stops. Solid action sequences, car chases, exotic locations, and elegant gowns and suits - Ghosted has all the essential elements of a classic spy film. The jokes land better than The Gray Man's quips, and the action is better than Red Notice's set pieces giving Ghosted a slight edge over its streaming adventure competition. It's a flawed movie for certain, with an out-of-place soundtrack and identity crisis, but what it does well makes it interesting enough for a watch and possibly even a sequel. ...maybe."
tt15326988,6.0,"I personally enjoyed this movie and would give it a 7 out of 10. While I don't agree with some of the negative reviews by critics, I acknowledge that everyone has different tastes in movies. For me, I found the story good and the chemistry between Chris Evans and Anna de Armas was ok. However, I do think that Chris Evans's chemistry and comedy with Jenny Slate in the 2017 movie 'Gifted' was much better. Anna de Armas' acting impressed me, she did a great job playing a spy in this movie and although Chris Evans didn't play a superhero or spy in this movie this wasn't his best performance, he did do just ok. Additionally, I appreciated that the movie wasn't too long and the change of scenes in different countries was impressive. However, I do think the trailer gives away too much, so it's best to avoid it. While the story didn't keep me guessing, I still found it engaging and worth watching. Overall, I would recommend this movie, especially if you're a fan of action, adventure, comedy, and a bit of romance. Catch it on Apple TV+!"

However, as the movie progresses, it starts to become a bit boring and basic especially with the dialogue that felt really cheap. The movie had it's funny parts but it wasn't too funny overall. The action scenes were decent but there weren't so many of those. Also, the use of CGI and green screen could have definitely been better.

Also, it was so good seeing Chris Evans in a more comedic role and not a pure action role. Although his action scenes were very good. The movied is filled with cameos that we all love too. It was a very good move from the creators and the producers of the movie as they used this as a selling point while promoting the movie and it paid off.Overall the movie is nothing over the top but it can still be enjoyed as a simple and relaxing watch.Score: 5/10."
tt15326988,5.0,"As bad as this movie is -- and it is -- it might yet attract an audience based on novelty value alone. Each lead actor is A-listed, and more than capable of carrying a entire feature on their own. Evans, hobbled with a beard and an inhaler, still comes across as the ultimate Alpha Male. De Armas has never given a bad performance, and has never failed to completely charm an audience. Brody is a legend with a mind-boggling filmography to his credit. The problem is the script. OMG. Maybe the three writers hated each other. Sure looks that way. There is barely a single line of dialog that rings true. No chemistry between the two leads whatsoever. Editing that moves around so quickly you can get a headache. And the movie is so slow for the first 30 minutes, you could finish your tax return while waiting for something to happen.

tt15326988,5.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. I am often accused of taking movies too seriously rather than just sitting back and enjoying the entertainment value. Well, this latest from director Dexter Fletcher (ROCKETMAN 2019, EDDIE THE EAGLE 2015) is textbook 'popcorn entertainment' made for those who prefer to sit back and enjoy. There is plenty to like here and it did generate a few laughs, yet it's still a movie that doesn't hold up to much thought or post-viewing discussion. SPIDER-MAN collaborators Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and DEADPOOL collaborators Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have joined forces on a script that somehow doesn't have the dialogue zings that can keep pace with the action sequences.An early meet-cute occurs as organic family farmer Cole Turner (Chris Evans bucking his Captain America persona) unknowingly flirts with market shopper Sadie Rhodes (Ana de Armas, fresh off her Oscar nomination for BLONDE, 2022), recommending she purchase a cactus rather than a Begonia once she discloses her work travel schedule. An all-day and all-night date ends with Cole telling his family that ""she may be the one."" His caustic sister (Lizzie Broadway) skewers him with the funniest one-liners in the film while informing that his smothering texts and emojis have likely caused Sadie to ghost him.It's at this point where the clumsy organic farmer turns into an extreme stalker and heads to London ... don't ask what trick allowed him to track her. A photo op at Tower Bridge ends with Cole being abducted and presumed to be ""The Taxman"" (cue Beatles song), the only person with the code to unlocking a chemical weapon in the possession of arms dealer and dastardly bad buy Leveque (Oscar winner Adrien Brody). Of course, Sadie rescues Cole at the last minute, and her cover as an international art curator is blown ... surprise! She's actually a highly-skilled CIA spy.Three major action sequences are featured: an exciting bus-in-reverse along a mountain side road in Pakistan, a fight scene aboard a private jet, and a guns-blazing shootout in a rotating high-rise restaurant. Ana de Armas is terrific in the action sequence and her rapport with Chris Evans (first noted in KNIVES OUT, 2019) elevates the toothless banter between the two. It's a bit shocking that this group of writers couldn't land on wittier and sharper comments for these two characters as they bounce around the globe ... even racing up THE EXORCIST stairway. At times it feels like an episode of ""Get Smart"", although the action sequences are first rate.Supporting roles are held by Mike Moh, Amy Sedaris, Tate Donovan, and the always fun Tim Blake Nelson. Many will enjoy the hand full of cameos that pop up, at least one ""Wilhelm scream"", and the sometimes obvious and/or cheesy song selection ... a rare soundtrack to include both The Knack and Dua Lipa. The film leans more into cute than witty than danger, but with two of the most attractive stars working today, that's forgivable. Just get your popcorn ready and sit back and enjoy this rom-com/action-thriller, and don't think too much.The film will be on Apple TV+ on April 21."
tt15326988,6.0,"Captain Needy finally meets his dream girl, sleeps with her, but then he gets ghosted.It's all fine and dandy up until this point. The chemistry between the two leads, Chris Evans and Ana De Armas, who always steals every scene she is in, is fantastic and minor characters like Needy's brutally honest sister, add spark to what could have been a great mystery thriller.Needy then becomes Captain Stalker when he decides to follow Dream Girl's trail all the way to London after having left dozen of unanswered messages, like only a loser/very romantic guy (take your pick) would do.Quickly, like the screenwriter just gave up and handed the whole thing to a stuntmovie coordinator, the whole affair then turns into an action spectacle where everyone wants the content in a suitcase. How original.There's a great action setpiece involving a bus, but whenever I see movies where women throw around men who are three times their own weight and size and in life threatening situations are either cracking jokes or discussing with their fellow in arms, I just zone out and wonder if I am watching one of those gamevideo walkthroughs set on God mode.This could have, and should have, been so much better."
tt21113540,5.0,"Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, wants to die. Problem is, he's a vampire, which makes things quite difficult. Having lived for over 200 years, experienced the French Revolution as a young French army officer, several other historic events, settled down in Chile, worked his way to the top, ruled ruthlessly and opulently and now been hounded by people seeking the truth, he's feeling a bit jaded. His family, on the other hand, are looking forward to their inheritance.I watched this because the main premise of this movie - Augusto Pinochet is a 200+ year old vampire - intrigued me. However, that novelty wears off pretty quickly. There's still some good dark comedy throughout the film centred around this but not enough to sustain the intrigue that this initially created.More than being about Pinochet being a vampire, it's the fact that he's over it all and wants to die that is the spine of the plot. This works well, initially, but quickly gets bogged down as it seems to go around in circles, making no progress.That pretty much sums up the movie: much promise, with initial premises, plots and sub-plots that offer heaps of potential but go nowhere, slowly. It all feels so tedious and pointless.Even a very left-field twist towards the end can't lift this above mediocre. Very disappointing."
tt21113540,6.0,"Great premise; oddly executed. Chile's brutal fascistic former leader Pinochet was actually a vampire who started as a soldier in Napoleon's army. This film takes place while he's living in seclusion after faking the death all the world thinks it had witnessed. The Church sends a brilliant young nun there to try saving whatever soul may lie within him, and snatch what she can find among his massive hidden wealth for the Kingdom of God. His non-vampiric wife and five middle-aged children have their own financial aspirations, gathering in anticipation of the REAL death the old guy now wants. Pinochet can't remember where he stashed all the documentation of his global holdings, accounts and investments, so the hunt begins.This setup could have played out as a zany farce, mocking real-life historic figures, as was done in the delightfully caustic satire, The Death of Stalin (2017). But this pursues a completely opposite comedic direction. It's shot in extremely gloomy B&W, in bleak and barren settings resembling a ghost town in a desert. The lack of color links it to the seminal vampire flicks of the 1930s -'40s, tones down the visceral impact of the gory stuff, and amplifies the craven aspects of human nature. Film students may admire the techniques for sustaining such extreme understatement.This may unfold too slowly and subtly for many, but the satire hits multiple targets, with a wonderful bonus twist in the last 20 minutes that rewards one's patience."
tt21113540,6.0,"It begins well, with a absurd sense of humor mocking the Pinochet regime and his lasting legacy(which is referenced throughout the film) in the years after his death. I especially laughed at his eyes opening whilst in the glass coffin as unsuspecting mourners walked past offering their condolences to his ' dead' body.I also liked how Margret Thatcher narrated the film - as she was an ally to this murderous beast in his lifetime-I've always thought her voice comical and here the actress plays her highlighting the stupidity of the whole endeavor with solemn seriousness.Where the film fails is the middle section where it becomes draggy and talky until finally, moderately, picking up in the last act.The black and white photography, moving camera and acting are all top notch and seeing the vampiric Pinochet flying through the air at night is a humorous , over the top touch.Chilean writer/director Pablo Larrain's best film I've seen is the equally bonkers psychological horror/drama 'Spenser', which had more depth, heart and a solid sympathetic performance by Kirsten Stewart."
tt21113540,6.0,"The option for Augusto Pinochet is ...realistic.If you remind his regime traits and the late venerability, it becomes more...credible. And this is the fair premise of a film mixing nostalgia of Gothic stories ( and classic horror films ), with a precise crafted story about power, Catholic Church,some politics and some vampire stories touch, greed and roots and a simple desire. And, sure, useful dark humor.A film like a sort of exorcism against a period , a paternal figure and a perspective about power and development of Chilian society. And few good points like the resemblance of Paula Luchsinger with Maria Falconetti and interesting portrait of Mother offered by Stella Gonet.In short, seductive, provocative and some eccentric at whole , as a fabulous travel in past with powerful flavors of dark fairy tales ."
tt21113540,6.0,"Beautifully shot in 99.9% B&W from a very leftist perspective about the eternal legacy of power, corruption, greed and wealth using vampirism as a metaphor. Here the church in the embodiment of a condescending nun, who though in nature should be the liberator of vampire souls, is in reality secretly in pursuit of the same forces through lust. It's really quite bizzare, surreal, expressionistic, kind of incomprehensible and black as black comedy can be. The humor can suddenly jump at you and make you laugh and it has some famous political figures in it to set its political stance. Watch it if you want to experience something mesmerizing but weird from the other dimension."
tt21113540,5.0,"A good subject, good technical possibilities and a wasted movie.Unfortunately, Pablo Larraín, to whom Netflix pinned its hopes and gave full control after No, Spencer and Jackie, could not go beyond making an expensive mediocre movie.Costumes, location choices, workmanship of the art team, sound design, cinematography... Everything is magnificent, but when the film comes together, the result is unfortunately bad.If I were the Count, I would die of boredom watching this movie.And the most important thing; A Chilean film should not have English narration for whatever reason.But even this is not a reason to save the movie from mediocrity."
tt21113540,6.0,"I write somewhat reticent cause I really wanted to like El Conde. Which I kinda did, thus the film has the merits for it. The photography is very powerful and the premise of the story, even its presentation in the first third, is more than effective and engaging. The performances in general are good, and Vadell's is outstanding. But the director makes the mistake of making his voice too strong at times, constantly establishing judgments, as if he doubted the viewer's criterion; bordering on a relentless condescension. The satire became rigorous and aggressive intermittently, but from beginning to end.This excessiveness, which when used properly can perfectly be a virtue, broke the cohesion of the (amplified) reality that it postulated and ended up disfavoring the effect of the narration. The irreverence of the satire was infected with a somewhat naive denunciatory impetus, and the film ended up saying more than necessary; at times the nature of the portrait was too explicit: it is not necessary to constantly tell us how perfidious these characters are, the story is already doing it.And it's not that it's a problem to spit the name of a dictator back and forth, cause who cares if an illiterate and delinquent old bum is denigrated. But the narrative tone and the dialogues, influenced by these somewhat emotional accusatory urges, seemed to belong to more than one film. At times to comedy, at times to cinema, at times to a documentary denunciation, at times to a political lecture on morality and ethics: it would have been good if the director had let us infer all this from the story alone; The interactions, the universe, the images that inhabited this unscrupulous and decadent family already managed to synthesize that.Apart from this, my assessment is kinda positive. The photography is compelling, the storyline is interesting enough, the atmosphere manages to converge with the images, and the dialogues, when they are not so emphatically voluntary and instead seek to favor the narrative above all, made me laugh a few times."
tt6856242,5.0,"""The King's Man,"" directed by Matthew Vaughn, is the third film in the ""Kingsman"" series, which began way back in 2014. The first in the franchise, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service,"" was a remarkably entertaining film; packed with Vaughn's signature directorial flair and high-octane, frantic editing style, the light parody of the spy genre made for a movie that took itself seriously enough to be engaging while simultaneously keeping its tone light enough to avoid being a complete retread of things we've seen before. Enter its sequel: ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle."" Taking the idea of a spy parody and dialing the notch as far as it would go, and then breaking it, ""The Golden Circle"" jumped in the pool of complete farce. While containing some genuinely emotional moments, the consensus was that the film was too goofy to be enjoyed, complete with absolutely ridiculous and unbelievable plot points such as a man inserting a GPS tracker inside of a woman (and I'll just let you imagine how he does that).A few years and a global pandemic later and we finally have the third entry, which stands as a prequel, effectively telling why the Kingsman secret agency came to fruition. Foregoing the odd and overtly sexual humor of the previous two films, ""The King's Man"" is a much more serious endeavor - for better or for worse. It's very obvious that director Matthew Vaughn wanted to change his style somewhat drastically when compared to the first two movies. A slower, more dialogue focused picture, you would almost be forgiven if you thought that ""The King's Man"" was directed by someone else entirely. Vaughn decides to tell what is, basically, a World War 1 film, which may surprise those who expected a lighter affair more akin to his other works. Tonal inconsistency isn't something I notice very much during my movie-going escapades, but due to the drastic change in subject matter, in ""The King's Man,"" the tonal shifts were jarring.""Fun"" is not a word I'd use to describe this movie, unfortunately. And yes, while a few action scenes were certainly exciting, as a whole ""The King's Man"" weaves a tale that is more about the horrors of war and violence then about the titular secret service agency that we've all come to know and love. A large majority of this movie involves political conversations that lack the character personality needed to make such conversations entertaining to watch. Instead, characters take the dialogue very seriously which, frankly, is boring to watch. In between these conversations lie multiple and varied story beats, including: An attempt to defeat the crazed monk Rasputin, a plot to steal a tape that contains recordings of the U. S. president engaged in illicit activities, and the tale of Conrad, Ralph Fiennes' characters son, who enlists in the war against his father's wishes. As you may have deduced, it is the last beat mentioned that contains some of the more emotional story moments. Now I'm not against emotion in my movies, obviously, and there were some genuinely shocking, saddening, parts in this story. That said, I don't think the right balance was there to make these moments as effective as they could be.Vaughn seems to have trouble deciding what kind of story he wants to tell - is it a dramatic tale of the tragedies that arise with war, or is it a wacky action-adventure, complete with ballet battles, bisexual villains, and over-the-top set pieces? He tries to do both, and misses the mark, creating a confusing, convoluted, and overly lengthy story - albeit one that can be entertaining. No stranger to great action, Vaughn once again directs some fantastically kinetic fight sequences. The battle with Rasputin alone is worth the price of admission, and combined with a great score and masterful editing, I couldn't help but have a smile on my face during that scene, and throughout all of the action sequences. So if you're looking for good action, you'll certainly find it here (with a trench battle being another standout) - you'll just have to sit through a stunning amount of slog to get to it first.Ralph Fiennes gives a totally committed performance - him, along with the action, makes ""The King's Man"" a perfectly serviceable one-time watch. ""The King's Man"" isn't necessarily a bad movie, but it's one that gets held back by its own loftiness and high expectations of itself. Fans of the first two movies will most likely be disappointed by the change in tone and story, and those who are looking for something new will no doubt be taken aback by the tonal inconsistencies - which brings me to the question: Who, exactly, did Vaughn make this movie for?"
tt6856242,6.0,"A decent prequel that had a few great action scenes and dramatic moments; but that overall didn't have the charm of its predecessors. The CGI looked too computer generated and the storyline too heavy. With so much story to cover the scene jumps happened to often and disrupted the flow. Acting was good and characters were well cast,"
tt6856242,5.0,I really liked the first Kingsman movie but already the second one was in my opinion just milking the cow - story- and momentum-wise inferior to the first movie in every aspect. The newest addition to the franchise tries something new but - while there are for sure some good aspects - tastes like a bad mixed cocktail: the ingredients (or parts) just don't work too well together. The King's Man: no fail but compared to Kingsman: The Secret Service this one is just another rather weak entry.
tt6856242,6.0,"I was very impressed with Matthew Vaughn's directing and writing in the first two films, of whom Jane Goldman also shared the writing credits, but in this one she was absent, and wow what a difference it made. In the ridiculously unnecessarily long 131 min runtime, only 10 mins total had anything to do with the Kingsmen. The rest was a convoluted scattershot of unnecessary plots that seemed to be a bunch of short films thrown in a blender to come up with this nonsense. There were too many plot and technical issues, and scenes that will make you shake your head in disbelief of what you're seeing, and why. Even the entire villain portion was too short, lame, and lazily written and executed. There were so many long dragged out and unnecessary scenes, you can literally fast-forward to the end of the scene and miss nothing of relevance. Basically 90% of this film was all filler with very little substance - and that's as a stand-alone film; as a prequel, it's all filler with maybe 2-3 minutes of any ""Kingsmen"" relevance. It's really too bad, because the rest of the film - cinematography, choreography, performances etc were all very good. I gave the first two films 9's, and I'm struggling to even give my very generous 6/10 for this one. Please include Goldman in any future Kingsmen films; at least her vision was coherent, cohesive, and exciting."
tt6856242,6.0,"This is a prequel to Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014). Orlando (Ralph Fiennes) is the pacifist Duke of Oxford. He, his wife Emily, and their young son Conrad visit a British concentration camp in South Africa for the Red Cross. Emily is killed and he promises her to protect Conrad at all cost. With the impending First World War, Conrad is itching to join but Orlando refuses to let him go. Unbeknownst to them, there is a sinister force pushing the European empires into a devastating conflagration.There is a bit of awkwardness in reworking history. Apparently, a Scottish nationalist is responsible for WWI. Rasputin was a vampire... Now that's interesting. I wouldn't mind that movie. He seems to be a good boss level. That fight is fun. That should have been the story. Instead, the movie keeps going and going and going. Sometimes it's fine but mostly it meanders. Prequels are often problematic since the ending is pre-set with no surprises. This one is no different. It has various problems but Rasputin is really fun."
tt6856242,5.0,"There is no beating around the bush: this film is bad. But what makes it a cinematic atrocity is having such a large audience on hold, such a great cast, 100 mils and still messing it up. All Kingsman movies are over the top, but this one went both too far and did too little. It felt like 50% of it was exposition and the rest was Ralph Fiennes trying to save the film, to no avail.Ironically, the highlight of the film was Rhys Ifans. I mean, he's a great actor, but he was in select company: Fiennes, Dance, even Hollander and Goode. And while he played a rather minor character, from the entire cast he was the only one close to memorable.Perhaps tongue in cheek, perhaps in bad taste, in such a British film the Scots are the villains and the Americans are the jokes. WW I was a one man masterplan and one other man made it all stop. A pointless prequel if there ever was one, and that's saying a lot.The fight scenes were kind of well done, but that's the only positive thing I can think of. Acting was good, too, but no material to work with.Bottom line: a damn shame of a film."
tt6856242,5.0,"""Real power is not found running off to war. Real power lies in understanding who it is you're truly fighting, and how they can be defeated."" Duke of Oxford (Ralph Fiennes)The tongue is not too far in the cheek with the semi-serious King's Man starring Ralph Fiennes as the dapper but deadly Duke of Oxford, organizer of the sophisticated spy agency that in previous iterations was more satirical of spy stories. In this origin story,
much of the film weaves history around WW I into a fiction about a few good men and women trying to stop the march to war.The major historical figures are Kaiser Wilhelm, King George, and Tsar Nicholas-all played entertainingly by Tom Hollander. Not to be missed is Rhys Ifans as Rasputin, a diabolical force in getting the Soviet Union to withdraw from the war, to the delight of Germany and the dismay of England.When Rasputin battles with Oxford, the screen is alive with Russian-style dancing-swordplay, Rasputin's lusts, and plain old good dialogue. Director Matthew Vaughn allows his actors to express themselves wildly but with a modicum of Brit-like decorum fitting of the balance between dark history and playful replay.Besides the memorable Rasputin swordplay, in the final act, when Oxford uses a new-fangled parachute to storm the supreme villain's high mountain hide out, the stunt work is just short of breathless, coupled with CGI to give a Bondian feel to the spy shenanigans.I was pleasantly surprised by the imaginative re-creation of history and the low-key humor, so evocative of the Brit stereotype. More than one commentator has suggested how apt Fiennes would be as the new Bond. I don't know about that, but Fiennes sure does know his way around the screen.""We are the first independent intelligence agency. Refined but brutal, civilized but merciless."" Duke of Oxford."
tt6856242,6.0,3 out of 5 stars.The King's Man is a fair film and a prequel to the Kingsman series. The film taking place in the early 1900 and taking its story during the first World war.Plot is decent. Nothing creative like the first two films. The Resputin villain was entertaining and cheesy. The action sequences are ground and exciting.The cast ensemble was good. The film did lacked the fun direction that the first two films had. The dramatic story was dull. And has a serious direction.
tt6856242,5.0,".......And once that line is uttered, the film finally picks up, it's just a shame that the previous two hours were so bland and mundane.During the Great War, a former soldier turned pacifist is forced back into action when the forces of evil threaten to keep the war from ever ending.......I'm very fond of Matthew Vaughn and his films. Layer cake was an outstanding film, and he breathed life into the ailing X-Men franchise with first class. But this franchise has been a very strange one from the off.This prequel has Ralph Fiennes as the originator of the said Kingman, and because he's renounced violence, he forbids his son to take part in the Great War.So for the first to acts of the film we have Fiennes sipping whiskey, having suits fitted, and seeing Rhys Ifans totally embarrassed playing Rasputin. The plot features a heavily accented Scot who lives at the top of a mountain, being very angry, and taking his rage out on goats. From what there is of a plot, he wants to carry on the Great War, and tries to get three identical cousins to start a war, after all they are leaders of their respective ountries.Meanwhile, we get Fiennes getting his son involved in his secret group, and finally his son begins to realise that his dad isn't as boring.Now this is the part that surprised me the most. I was expecting the film have Fiennes pass the crown to his son come the end of the movie, but Vaughn treated us to a very big surprise just halfway through the film.It's a bland affair, action set pieces are boring and unimaginative, and the final reveal of the villain just mad me think 'really?'It also reminded me greatly of 1998's Avengers (Which Fiennes also starred in), and the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.It's all a little bit boring, and you can really feel the run time.I think the franchise is dead now.Small mercy I suppose."
tt6856242,6.0,"Kingsman: The Secret Service was one of the biggest surprises in a cinema I've had in the last decade. I remember being excited for it but I never expected to fall in love with it as much as I did and the film still holds up every time I rewatch it. I even enjoyed The Golden Circle, it's not perfect and nowhere near as good as the original but I still get a lot of enjoyment out of it. But from the moment The King's Man was announced I just couldn't understand why it was being made. I don't dislike the idea of doing a prequel film but I thought the franchise would be better suited to finishing up the Harry/Eggsy story first before going into spin off and prequel territory. I was hoping this film would surprise me by being a different kind of entry for the franchise but unfortunately it was every bit as pointless as I feared it would be.I think the thing that stops this film from being bad overall is it's central characters. Ralph Fiennes is great in this film, he is as perfectly cast in this role as Colin Firth was in the 2015 original. He brings all the charm and etiquette you'd expect from this type of character while being completely capable in all the action scenes. I also really liked newcomer Harris Dickinson, he gives a really good performance and has great chemistry with Fiennes. I liked that Vaughn didn't just make him an Eggsy clone, he's a very different character and much more stern and serious and it works surprisingly well. Djimon Hounsou and Gemma Arterton made for really likeable and entertaining side kicks and they actually ended up stealing the movie for large portions. Most of the villains I found to be underwhelming but with the exception of Rhys Ifan who may have ultimately been the best part of the entire experience for me. He was delightfully over the top, capable and threatening in all the fight scenes and hilariously funny, it's only a shame that he wasn't in the film more.I think The King's Man best finds it's footing in it's 3rd act. It's when all of the masses exposition start to pay off in some way and it's in this part of the film that it truly starts to feel like a proper Kingsman prequel. I started to recognise the tropes I love in those other two films and I have to praise that this did make the film end on a reasonably solid note for me. However a fairly good ending doesn't make up for the nearly 2 hour slog that The King's Man is leading up to that 3rd act. Vaughn spends most of the film trying to compress years of history into a 2 hour runtime and it feels unbelievably messy as a result. While I liked most of the action sequences they are few and far between and I have to say that I found the film boring for the most part. I think Vaughn was a little bit too devoted to real life events and I think he may have benefitted from taking some more creative liberties that better suited the Kingsman universe.In addition to how poorly paced the film was I also have no idea what Vaughn's ultimate vision for it was. The tone shifts between being a serious war drama and a more over the top spy film constantly, sometimes in the same scene, and these two styles do not mix well. The film spends large portions devoted to the trenches of World War One just to abruptly switch to the goofy, moustache twirling villains plotting their evil plans to take over the world and it just makes those more serious moments feel cheap by comparison. It's hard to feel like I'm watching a Kingsman film when I'm watching the battle sequences and it's hard to feel like I'm watching a war movie in those more Kingsman oriented scenes.I think there is a potentially good prequel somewhere inside this movie but it's buried underneath messy storytelling and two polar opposite tones that make me confused as too what kind of film I'm supposed to be watching. Thankfully it's central characters lift the film up somewhat and it's not without its entertaining and effective scenes but I just don't think Vaughn had a clear idea for what he wanted to do with this prequel. I think the best thing the franchise could do now is finish up the Harry/Eggsy trilogy and end things on as strong a note as possible.6.2/10 - C+ (Middling)"
tt6856242,6.0,"Taking an unusual direction from the previous two Kingsman movies, The King's Man ends up being far more serious and heavily influenced by historical events that happened a hundred years ago. Because of how much the film tries to tie these events into the story, it can feel confusing and messy with what is going on. Depending on expectations, people may end up being disappointed with this prequel.Matthew Vaughn's stylistic direction still flourishes in the action sequences and panning shots. The new set of characters in this prequel/origin story include standouts such as Rhys Ifans playing the crazy Russian Rasputin chewing the scenery and acting crazy, and Ralph Fiennes' Oxford playing a dad who ends up bringing some genuine strength and emotion to the spy role with great stability.Other characters also play their parts well, and the film looks pretty good in terms of production values and historical accuracy. If one thing is missing, it's the sense of charm and silliness of the first two films. That being said, the last third of the film did get me invested again. However, it wasn't quite enough to make up for the first hour or so of the film. The little glimpses of humour is present, but much rarer as the film focuses more on Drama.My overall thoughts on The King's Man is I appreciate them trying something different here, despite not staying as consistently entertaining as the first two films. The twists and turns are a little hit and miss, but the way it ties into Kingsman at the very end works really well. In the end, I'd say The King's Man is worth at least a single watch, despite being much different and more different in perspective.6/10."
tt6856242,6.0,"For those who always felt that history was boring ... well they can relive and rewrite it here. Or see it rewritten - though I reckon you have to at least have some understanding of history and who lived when or was assassinated by what and how that was managed ... or gone wrong.Of course this takes many liberties to say the least in the retelling - as I think I made obvious in my above statement. So some might think of it as fun - an entertaining ""history lesson"" of sorts .. others may not like the take on it. Of course if you already have an issue with the movie ... well it won't bode well going forward.I thought many jokes historically speaking worked. Still as my opening line or review summary already indicates, it is smaller bits and pieces ... and some do not seem to be fitting with others. Same goes with the tone - a romance, that isn't one. A saved by the bell moment, another moment that does almost tell us one of our main characters is invincible, just to completely turn this on its .. head! No pun intended.And an end fight that is quite nice, but a telegraphed twist punch (kick?) ... the midway fight, which feels more like a dance, is the way better choreographed one. Even if the end fight has a nice pov touch ... that should have only been used once ... maybe twice. But not as much as it ended up being on screen, because it got annoying. And again we are back to the walking a thin line, mixing things up, not being able to get the correct amount of whatever would be best for the story.We do have great actors and therefor most of the jokes work and even an omission of any story whatsoever does not really matter. The end twist should also be quite obvious - from the beginning almost. Shame - I really do like Matthew Vaughn and I especially liked the ... I'll call it approach to the first Kings Man movie ... this reboot/prequel kind of thing ... well it does not really do much for the franchise. But you may feel differently. Because you may be smitten by certain parts of the movie and can suspend your disbelief to feel this is a coherent amalgation of all things combined ... not minding that there is almost an absence of a cool uber villain (Rasputin aside who does a great job by the way) ... the wait was too long, the end result not entirely worth it. Some great jokes and great visuals aside."

tt0817230,6.0,"As a disgruntledly (not a word, shut up) unemployed film critic, I must take drastic measures in concealing my opinion towards a movie you are going to wind up seeing regardless. This time, I have taken my single self to see Valentine's Day, to see if it can measure up to last year's star-sprinkled surprise-surprise hit comedy He's Just Not That into You. I wanted to see that if despite without the lovey-dovey person by my side (which has been a vacant position for a while) the movie can still deliver, entertain, and touch the soul.Also, I wanted to see if people working at the theater would dedicate a bit of time from their ordinary day to point out that it's strange that I am watching a movie called Valentine's Day by myself. I approached the ticket counter and asked for my ticket. After momentary laughter the man at the counter presented me with my ticket. I then enter through the doors and approach the lady ripping the tickets and sending me in the right direction. After her laughter subdued, she pointed me to theater #1.Valentine's Day works in the tradition of last year's February romantic success story, and Love Actually, a British dramatic rom-com that jump-started the technique of applying multiple love stories in a film. That way, if one story doesn't work, you have multiple other chances to still enjoy the movie. To spice things up, the movie contains one of the biggest casts of stars since the never-duplicated insanity of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. What other movie can boast the collaboration of Jennifer Garner, Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx, and even Shirley MacLaine? But of course, when you have this many stars, that means so many stories; and less time for character development. This is where the film mostly disappoints, very little developing or changing from anyone associated with the movie. Without revealing too much, there is literally 10 or 11 (lost count) plot lines mixing and intertwining together in a span of just two hours. This equals an average of 12 minutes per story. In actuality however, some stories are actually shorter than others. Katherine Fugate had the right idea when writing the screenplay, but the execution wasn't the best considering that some stories worked and some were just boring to the core. Poor Garry Marshall can only do so much, even though his best days (Pretty Woman, Happy Days) are long gone.The limited time for acting also diminished the performances of almost every single star in the movie. However, the acting performances of the younger tots (Taylor Swift, Emma Roberts, Taylor Lautner, Carter Jenkins) were much weaker when compared to the veterans Julia Roberts, Jamie Foxx, Shirley MacLaine, and Héctor Elizondo. One other note: Ashton Kutcher, Topher Grace, and Bradley Cooper are three men that given the little time in this movie delivered swell performances that was undermined only by the writing. Their comic timing kept the movie afloat when the flick was threatening to totally flounder.Like I said before, some stories worked, and other stories were absolutely dreadful to watch. The high school-based stories in Valentine's Day were the weakest, shortest, and the most pointless. In the meantime, the Anne Hathaway/Topher Grace story and the conflict involving Kutcher, Alba, Jennifer Garner, and Patrick Dempsey were the most entertaining to watch. Nearly all the stories had their share of clichés, with only one of them containing a surprise or two. The chemistry wasn't that intense, because there was no time for it to happen. The dialogue was never allowed to intensify or dwell deeper into the concept of love. A few good one-liners here and there, but nothing really worth remembering.Bottom Line: The problem with Valentine's Day is very simple: we've seen it before and after 2009 being such a good year for romantic comedies, the expectations are higher. It takes more than just a bunch of big stars to propel a rom-com to quality heights; you need strong writing, good chemistry, strong direction, and a hintage of unpredictability. That's how The Proposal, He's Just Not That Into You, The Ugly Truth, and especially (500) Days of Summer made 2009 one of the greatest years for romance in a long time. This was also the issue with Couple's Retreat, the last blockbuster romantic comedy of 09. Valentine's Day has its moments indeed (Anne Hathaway is hilarious), but don't expect it to be anything better than mediocre. Simply there were too many stories and most of them with less depth than a puddle.And none of this criticism has to do with the fact that I saw the movie by myself.Honestly."
tt0817230,5.0,"Cluttered, sloppy romantic comedy would have benefited from the elimination of a few of its many stories. Mixed bag of performances, both Julia and Emma Roberts, Cooper, Dane are charismatic and do what they can to flesh out thin characters. Anne Hathaway and Topher Grace have a great chemistry and really could have supported their own independent romantic comedy. MacLaine and Elizondo are wasted in a throwaway story that does contain a nice twist. Several of the quality performers, like Queen Latifah and Kathy Bates are shoved in small parts strictly for marquee value. Most of the others range from adequate to vapid. Taylor Swift stands out for giving the most annoying performance. Let's hope that this is the beginning and the end of her acting career. One last thought, with all the talent available they chose to focus the largest portion of the film's story on someone as bland as Kutcher? Bad idea."

And up in the air, an off-duty soldier (Julia Roberts) travels from afar just to spend one day with someone she loves...Watching this film is like spending Valentine's Day with the 'Who's Who' of Hollywood. There are so many big-name performers here that you will be struggling to name them - unless you are a star-gazer yourself. However, instead of being distracting, it is kinda fun - especially if you are fans of say, Grey's Anatomy, and get thrilled by seeing its famous doctors on screen.And while the script may be predictable, it is only fair to say that writer Katherine Fugate has a few nice surprises up her sleeves too. Overall, Valentine's Day is about flowers, candy and fluff. And this see-and-forget movie is a guilty pleasure. - by LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)"
tt0817230,5.0,"Director Garry Marshall brings us an intertwining series of love stories in Los Angeles on Valentine's Day. They're mostly inoffensive sugar coated superficial stories. And then there are the Taylors, Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner. They're trying to be the comic relief. I'm not sure why Garry Marshall thought they would be good at comedy. At least they stand out in this A-list lovefest. One of these are not like the others. Their complete ignorance and their oddity has its own charm. They're somewhat funny in one scene being interview by a news reporter.It's a mess of too many characters in too many stories. After the first two or three plot lines, the rest starts becoming one big confused mishmash. I couldn't tell you what half of their stories are. And they just keep adding more characters. It's an avalanche of hot acting talents."
tt0817230,6.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, but I watched it anyway, because I like a lot of the people in the cast. My overall thoughts on Valentine's Day was that it wasn't terrible but it was very uneven and I do have to agree with anyone who says Love Actually did it better, it did.Starting off with Valentine's Day, it does have a great cast. Jennifer Garner and Anne Hathaway especially are very charming, and I liked the little boy who had a crush on Garner. It was also really nice to see Hector Elizondo and Shirley McLaine again, same with Patrick Dempsey and I also thought Taylor Swift was delightfully ditzy in her debut. I didn't mind Julia Roberts either, however the only ones I didn't like so much were Jessica Alba, who doesn't have that much to do and Taylor Lautner who was rather bland, and it seemed ironic that his character didn't want to take his shirt off, when in New Moon(horrible film by the way) Lautner spends most of the time with it off. Asides from the cast, Valentine's Day was nicely filmed and had a lovely soundtrack. And I thought several of the stories worked, especially Garner's.However, I wasn't completely sure about the phone sex idea and Eric Dane's story is painfully underdeveloped. The script also has its weak spots with nothing really sticking out in the mind, in fact there were only a few amusing moments as the film is more bittersweet than funny, particularly the one in the restaurant with the conversation about the pig's meal. The film also drags badly, while the direction isn't quite as focused as it would have liked.Overall, it isn't terrible, but it is very uneven. Worth seeing once or twice, but it isn't a movie for me that is to watch every day of the week. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
tt7985704,5.0,"Facing lengthy delays in release following the current war in the Ukraine, with key parts of the films plotline involving Ukrainian antagonists, Guy Ritchie's seemingly forgotten about Operation Fortune: Ruse de guerre finds the colourful director back on familiar ground with an equally familiar partner in crime in the form of Jason Statham but while on paper everything here points to another The Gentleman/The Man from U. N. C. L. E like Ritchie venture, sadly Operation feels like nothing more than a pale imitation of the British filmmakers best work.Delivering mild distractions and occasionally featuring the directional flair that made Ritchie one of the most interesting directors to establish himself in the late 90's and early 2000's, Operation is an odd effort from Ritchie who has all the tools at his disposal here to make sure this venture has the same pizazz and smarts as his newly minted cult favourite The Gentleman or his classics Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrell's but is unable to elevate Operation to anything more than a fast-moving escapade that fails to maximize its premise, locations, cast or budget allocation.Following the escapades of Jason Statham's suavely named wine loving holiday taking Orson Fortune and his crack team of special agent operatives that includes Audrey Plaza's scene-stealing Sarah, Bugzy Malone's impeccably dressed JJ and Cary Elwes minder Nathan as the crew try and uncover what Hugh Grant's arms-dealing Greg Simmonds is up to on the black market with the team enlisting the help of Josh Hartnett's Hollywood heartthrob Danny Francesco to help out their cause, Operation is an over the top and globe-spanning action comedy that Ritchie on peak form could've turned into a crowd-pleasing and critically appreciated sleeper hit but here on finished product is likely to find his Wrath of Man follow up failing to inspire much interest in any market.One glaring aspect of Operation's middling nature can be traced back to Operation's script that Ritchie worked on alongside Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, with the director's often whip-smart and often genuinely quotable snips and quips only rarely shining here in an otherwise undercooked piece of screenwriting that leaves little room for its talented actors to do much of note with their characters or their wisecracking and while Statham is typically Stathamly, outside of Plaza's off-kilter Sarah and Grant's scene chewing Simmonds, Operation fails to give us the type of memorable players we have previously found in Ritchie's best crime/action comedies.In an age where it feels as though the big screen comedy is a dying breed, it would have been fantastic to see Operation find it's mojo in a much more notable way and while the film appears to come alive in a bigger way in its late act stages, for much of Operation's runtime you'll be hard pressed to find much worth getting excited about, a shame when you know the man behind the whole affair can often provide the type of fun and showmanship the film is too frequently lacking.Final Say -A watchable and mildly entertaining distraction, Operation Fortune feels like Ritchie on sleepwalking mode as the director fails to utilize all the tools at his disposal that could have easily lead to a much more memorable outing than what we get here.2 1/2 expensive bottles of wine out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
tt7985704,6.0,"The good: Hugh Grant is brilliant in his role as a powerful mastermind criminal. But that's not enough...The bad: this spy flick is lacking in real thrill. And it definitely intended to be a real thrilling spy flick. One down.More bad: the jokes arent really funny. Missing the mark almost every time. That's two down.Even more bad: the supporting actors are bland. All of them. That's three down.Beware all you Jason Statham fans, this movie surely aint a terrible spy action flick, but it is definitely not Jason Statham's best either, because I have seen all his moves before, done better. And although the quirky and wonderful actress Aubrey Plaza is co starring I must admit that even her role is not her best either.So what we have here is a below average spy flick, that just wont get really exciting.Still worth a watch, but dont expect any originality or real thrill. It'll do as a mindless throwaway spy flick."
tt7985704,6.0,"This time, Mr. Ritchie brought us a more conventional action comedy, of the genre of ' team of unconventional agents/thieves, endowed with unique and valuable skills, in a tough operation"", in the line of F&F: comedy, action, expensive car chases, guns, fights, sunny days, luxurious settings and stuff, and nice looking people.Obviously, with some sarcasm (the obsession of the J. Statham character for luxury and very expensive stuff is one of many examples that show us the story does not take itself seriously).The result is an enjoyable film, fun, fast and easy to follow, for a more general public than his, for example, extraordinary ""The Gentlemen"".All the actors involved are doing great and participating of the fun. However, a special mention should be made to Aubrey Plaza and Hugh Grant. They are carrying the weight of the movie and did a very nice job.One thing that broke my suspension of disbelief was the outrageously poor and unprofessional setting of the Madrid (Spain) episode. The fictional ""aeropuerto de Madrid"", ridiculous uniforms, car plates, and so on took me out of the movie. Thankfully, Hugh Grant brought me back to it.Overall: not a great movie, but one to have a good time."
tt7985704,6.0,"Somebody stole something to sell to someone. A team is put together to find out all of the above and retrieve whatever this is. This was exactly what you'd expect from a Jason Statham film with humor in it.Looks like Guy Ritchie wants to take this in a franchise direction and based on this first film, I don't know if it's worth the effort. Action - decent. Statham does what he usually does in a film like this. Humor - there's a decent amount of it, exactly what you'd expect from Aubrey Plaza and from Guy Ritchie dialogues. Hugh Grant was good!If you're a Statham fan, and go into into this film expecting the Transporter, you'll be let down. If you enjoyed watching stuff like The Red Notice or The Gray Man but wished things weren't as over-the-top as they were in these two films, you'll enjoy this one. There's nothing GREAT about this film but it's a decent one-time watch if you have nothing else to watch."
tt7985704,5.0,"As a generic action flick I guess this is sort of ok. For the new Guy Ritchie film its super disappointing. The only stand out aspect is Hugh Grant who is excellent. The rest, from storyline, acting, action sequences, comedy are all incredibly mediocre. Statham does his most basic Statham when he can do much more given the script and direction. Aubrey is ok, i think she was supposed to be funny though and she isnt at all, that isnt her problem because she is generally awesome. The other guy, was just filler, im not sure what he was even there for. The main thing though is the story, its just nothing, it could be a Steven Seagal movie it has no twists turns or surprises."
tt7985704,5.0,"Highly disappointed with this movie. I don't know if I had too high of an expectation but the movie was a huge let down.Acting was mediocre(except for Mr Grant), action was meaningless and dumb most of the time, comedic relief was slow and far between.The story itself is really what drags this movie down tho, the premise is bad, unimaginative and full of plotholes. The scenario seems rushed, the dialog is abysmal and one liners are abundant and unfunny.Filmography is ok-ish, there are a couple of good scenes, but most is outlandish but not in a good way.All in all, this movie(franchise if they get away with it) is sadly just a huge cash grab with no real essence.If it wasn't a Guy Ritchie nobody would even know it exists."
tt7985704,6.0,"Operation Fortune: Ruse de guerre is a new spy thriller directed, part written and produced by Guy Ritchie, director of Snatch and the live-action Aladdin movie.In the film, MI6 agent Orson Fortune (Jason Statham) is recruited by international intelligence's Five Eyes. Together with CIA agent Sarah Fidel (Aubrey Plaza), they must persuade Hollywood star Danny Francesco (Josh Hartnett) to help them infiltrate the network of arms dealer Greg Simmonds (Hugh Grant). Greg is in the business of selling new, deadly weapon technologies, with which the buyer can disrupt the world order.Guy Ritchie knows how to make this film another entertaining espionage thriller, which he further fills with light comedy moments. Different espionage groups try to achieve the same final mission in the film and playfully ridicule each other during this mission. For example, the film contains entertaining espionage self-deprecating comedy. Guy Ritchie and the co-writers of the film also try to keep the story interesting with twists. In the end, the story has too many characters and twists to be able to clearly follow the story to the end. If the movie had been a bit shorter, it could have had a more understandable ending. Problems for the characters to continue with their missions are sometimes solved too simply. Some of these problems are also solved in a similar way, which can sometimes make it seem a bit too bland and simple. Guy Ritchie knows how to portray the film beautifully and realistically and shows well some of the different places where the film takes place.Most of the film cast also know how to provide good and appropriate acting. This is Guy Ritchie's fifth film with Jason Statham. Together they provide entertaining action scenes, in which Jason Statham emerges well as the leading role of the film. Together with Aubrey Plaza as his technical right hand, the two also manage to provide entertaining moments where the two try to work together in contradictory ways. Aubrey Plaza also knows how to appropriately use her own awkward and sarcastic form of comedy in the film. Hugh Grant also comes across as a nice corrupt arms dealer, who also has his own ways of humor.This film was first supposed to be released in cinemas in 2022, but due to current events, they have postponed the film. Some villains in the story are Ukrainian and because of the war between Ukraine and Russia, the film has been postponed. In this way, Ukraine will be less in a bad light during this dark and heavy period."
tt7985704,6.0,"With regular co-writers Ivan Atkinson & Marn Davies, Guy Ritchie dumbs actioner ""Operation Fortune: Ruse De Guerre"" down so much that it woulda stunk but for some stand-out support performances - notably from Hugh Grant & Aubrey Plaza. For UK govt bod Eddie Marsan, Cary Elwes runs the private special agent trio of Jason Statham, Plaza & Bugzy Malone. Using movie star Josh Hartnett as an in, they must find out who arms dealer mogul Grant is selling a stolen uber-powerful weapon to, and foil him before a rival troupe does. Silly & forgettable it's Ritchie's weakest (bar ""Swept Away"") but with its global settings and the fine Grant & Plaza, it's still passable - just."
tt0099938,6.0,"I'm not really a fan of Schwarzenegger's comedy films, given that I adore his action movies and would much rather be watching them instead. Stuff like TWINS tends to leave me cold, but I think it's fair to say that KINDERGARTEN COP is probably the best of his family-oriented flicks. The story, which sees Arnie's cop undercover in a school and saddled with a class of boisterous kids, almost writes itself.The reason that this is a workable film comes down to the script, which is laden with all of the classic one liners we know and love from the star. Schwarzenegger's interactions with his child co-stars are hilarious, and by throwing a ferret into the mix the producers round it out really. I also appreciated the film's efforts to explore the effect of broken homes upon kids, domestic violence and parental abuse.Elsewhere, it can be rather twee and overly sentimental at times, but nowhere near the level that Spielberg overdoes it. The action is very limited and infrequent, so much so as to be barely worth mentioning. Instead this is a film that rests on the (very) broad shoulders of its star, who acquits himself well as the likable hero who ends up completely out of his depth."

The acting was all right but the cast wasn't looking punjbi at all. Srk - Tapsi big Zero in chemistry and coming on screen together as 2 Punjabis, better would be Shahid Kapoor or Daljit.Background score and music aren't that good either.

tt4123432,5.0,"The Harry Potter books achieved so much success because a dedicated writer thought about the story for years and the result, imperfect as it was, became beloved by millions of people as the effort showed. This film is perfect, though, a total and complete mess, written by people who can never come up with more than an elevator pitch and the crave for a big payout. The movie uses a plot that purposefully makes no sense, built on a previous film that no one remembers and manages to cement Dumbledore as a manipulative asshole whose value for humanity is that he looks nice compared to the genocidal maniacs he fights against. But he's gay, so that's fine.It gets worse, though. So many things in the film not only not make sense, but contradict lore from the books. The film is called Fantastic Beasts, but really it's just one and it doesn't do much except for the ending. The magical world of wizards is now angry, political, divided and warlike, because that's what Americans are like, obliterating the elegant traditionalist Britishness of the books. Magic is only used to show off, fight or destroy now.The more I think about it, the angrier I become, which is not really what I want or need. My advice is to skip this film completely. Too bad, too, because Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Dan Fogler and Mads Mikkelsen did a great job as actors. Alas, the material they had to work with was utter garbage."
tt4123432,6.0,"The Secrets of Dumbledore is convoluted by inconsequential plotlines and redundant characters. It's so unfocused, it doesn't have a consistent tone or protagonist. The film centers around wizarding politics, but doesn't elaborate on them. This shrinks the Potterverse and satisfies nobody. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Law's protagonist duet is equally unsatisfying. Oddly, no character feels essential (besides Grindelwald) and action sequences don't progress the story. Ultimately, the movie is overstuffed and develops nothing. Mikkelsen and Fogler excel in their limited roles, but they're sparse in this jumble. Without streamlining, The Secrets of Dumbledore is emotionally uninspired.Technically, The Secrets of Dumbledore is disappointing. First, the effects are overdone. Earlier action is compelling, but the finale is undercut by excessive CGI. Plus, the production design in that final act feels empty. Squandering the union of fantasy and period dressings, the climax is woefully shallow. Furthermore, the editing is bloated and arbitrary because scenes don't influence one another. Lastly, the imagery is drab due to needlessly muted colors and plain framing. The solid music, impressive cast, and meaningful sound can only go so far. Overall, The Secrets of Dumbledore might please some, but is unlikely to leave an impression.Writing: 5/10

tt4123432,5.0,"The first 'Fantastic Beasts' film was very enjoyable. While having its fair share of problems, namely over-stuffing which affected the coherence, there was also a lot to like about the second, with Johnny Depp having much more of a chance to shine and shine he did. So seeing the third was definitely on the cards, despite its troubled behind the scenes with Depp's firing and the JK Rowling controversy which has affected the franchise's popularity this reviewer thinks.Was also really interested in seeing how Depp's replacement Mads Mikkelsen would fare as Grindelwald. Am someone who has a very high opinion of Mikkelsen and there are not many actors who can play villains as well as he. When seeing it in the cinema some months ago, my thoughts were mixed to midlly positive at first. When thinking over it more recently when finally getting round to reviewing, this reviewer actually found herself liking it less and feeling more strongly about the problems. Of the three, it's for me the weakest (and no, that it doesn't have Depp in it has nothing to do with it) as the first two at least felt like 'Fantastic Beasts' whereas this felt like a distant relative.'Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore' does have good things. It looks absolutely fantastic, with stunning set/production design, very atmospheric photography and effects that really do give off a sense of wonder. The music is rousing in spots, eerily haunting in others, jaunty in others and melancholic in others. Really liked that Newt had more to do and was more incidental to the story. When the beasts do feature, they are fun. Niffler steals every scene he appears in. Liked the Quilan too.Of all the scenes in the film, it does start off very well and intriguingly, everything with Dumbledore intrigues and evokes some nice unforced nostalgia and the climax did excite initially. But the highlight is the riotously bizarre dance as part of a particularly perilous escape, a scene that also had a lot of nail biting tension. It is well performed, Eddie Redmayne continues to be well cast as Newt and Dan Vogler has a lot of fun moments. Ezra Miller is quietly intense and Jude Law is nobly charismatic. Mikkelsen is always going to be compared to Depp, and while it is a very different interpretation and more James Bond villain-like Mikkelsen is still very menacing in a subtle way.Against all of that, there is a lot wrong. It was good that the plotting is more streamlined/straightforward and more coherent than the second, but it does suffer still from not doing enough with too many plot strands. Coming off worst is the Yusuf Kama subplot and role, which are completely incongruous to the story and could have been left out entirely because absolutely nothing is done with it. Credence's story, after so much promising build up and some nice suspense still, felt rather rushed.Moreover, 'Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore' is too long by about twenty minutes, tightening the pace, exciting Kama's role and storyline and trimming down a little some of the last act would have solved this. Didn't like too the script's annoying tendency to over-explain, too much telling and not enough show and too much of a reliance on background exposition. Really wish that there was more of the beasts, when they do appear they are fun (though only Niffler is properly memorable) but they are very under-utilised and have very little role in the story. Excepting a nice build up, the ending felt very anti-climactic and incomplete and is a type of ending that this reviewer doesn't care about usually in case another instalment or two is not done.In conclusion, very conflicted here and couldn't have feeling disappointed. 5/10."
tt4123432,6.0,"I am from the Harry Potter generation, I grew up with the books and the movies so there's no denying that I am a massive fan of the saga, so when the first news of prequels came out I was as you might imagine expectant!I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie, sure it lacks the originality and the magic of the original Potter films but it had one thing I really liked: it didn't force itself to be a part of the former stories while still being engaging and clearly happening in the same ""Universe"".This changed a bit when the second movie came around, Crimes of Grindelwald made a clear shift on the story and started to force itself in the ""Harry Potter"" timeline by navigating through the past of some of the beloved characters present in the original movies.And now the third.. where things just simply go sideways, not only it tries to explore even further Dumbledore's past, but fails miserably on doing so. There are a lot of points in the story that simply make no sense at all, the most annoying being the fact that most characters on screen have absolutely no influence on the plot, they are extras in their own film. Grindelwald ""rise to power"" is so forced, senseless and so generic to the point of being cringe..
It almost doesn't feel like a Wizarding World movie, the only reason I won't rate it lower is the creatures are indeed a great addition and being able to see Hogwarts always brings good memories, but that's about it in terms of positive aspects.The Credence plot is pointless after two movies developing it, the climax of the story feels empty after 140 minutes of waiting, the magic these days is used as generic fantasy movie would depict it with complete disregard of the ""Potter rules"", people throwing spells here and there without pronouncing them and us (the audience) not understanding what actually is going on.. They took the magic out and inserted the desire for money, it's sad for Potter fans around the world."
tt4123432,6.0,"In pleasing a result, the third entry into the Fantastic Beasts franchise (a franchise that seemingly exists with support but no dedicated fanbase or huge fanfare) is a marked improvement on the dire misstep that was 2018's The Crimes of Grindelwald, even if Harry Potter veteran director David Yates still can't find the real magic to enliven this wizarding world property to a level that would have it competing in the same space as the beloved films that came before this J. K Rowling property.Becoming less and less about the titular beasts that started this Eddie Redmayne lead adventure all the way back in 2016 and more about trying to draw in extra audience engagement and enthusiasm by bringing back known staples such as Hogwarts and a much more prevalent Albus Dumbledore into this latest outing, you can see the battle raging between Fantastic Beasts trying to figure out exactly what it is and who its for and its a battle that isn't won clearly by the conclusion of this third outing, making it a sometimes frustratingly cold experience that still manages to entertain to decent degree.Without a clear identity or even a character we can truly call our own, with Redmayne's Newt Scamander getting to do his awkward shtick here once more but feeling more like a bystander to whats going on around him, with new addition Mads Mikkelsen's Grindelwald growing in power and his old acquaintance Dumbledore trying to assemble a crack team to help thwart his plans, Fantastic Beasts is hamstrung by its inability to focus its attention into a specific story arc or character journey, with its drab grey and gloomy sets, dark themes and heavy topics feeling rather unmagical for a film that potentially could've finally shed the shackles of past expectations to really let fly with some inventiveness and spark.There are snippets of such things here, a prison escape and some brief moments spent back in the halls of Hogwarts but for a majority of the films two hour plus runtime there's not a whole lot of memorable moments delivered in Yates film, which is by no means offensively bad or incoherent like much of Crimes of Grindelwald was but it still makes you wish someone could take hold of this property and turn it into the possibly great series it could be, something that is unlikely now with two films left to come.While not inspiring much jaw-dropping or magical chills, there's still an undeniable cinematic goodness to Rowling's magic filled universe and there is a feeling here that with Dumbledore building his ragtag group of foot soldiers and with Mikkelsen giving Grindelwald a significant amount of menace and unnerving energy, there's hope yet still that the final chapters of Rowling's mid-tier and seemingly unloved property can still work to a level that will ensure we walk away from the Fantastic Beasts series indifferent in ways but not upset at what's been done to our beloved world of wizards, witches and muggles (and the odd beast or two).Final Say -Still far removed from even the lesser of the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is a small step back in the right direction following the crimes of the last entry and while its still not awe-inspiring by any stretch of the imagination, its a passable diversion of anyone with a passing interest in the Harry Potter cannon.3 crab walks out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
tt4123432,6.0,"The Fantastic Beast Movies should have been about Newt Scamander and friends going on wild and crazy adventures where they run into or face numerous mythical beasts. Imagine Newt interacting with an infant Fluffy (from HP Sorcerers Stone) or taming a Hungarian Horntail. Unfortunately, the fantastic beasts are overshadowed by the Dumbledore VS Grindelwald conflict. However, the film contained stunning visuals and great character performances; but lacked the tension and pizzaz required for a final battle. Worth a watch but falls short with the fantastic beasts being cast aside for a plot that does not entirely deliver."
tt4123432,6.0,"Was the third installment in the Fantastic Beast ""universe"" a succes?Well, the main storyline was okey but the rest of it was kinda unimportant and not that interesting..
Also like i had with the previous two installments was the lack of intensity and emotions in the action scenes.And after 3 completed movie i still can't find my connection with most of the characters especially the main one's.The ""recasting"" of Johnny Depp was a huge mistake for the development of Grindelwald's character!One of the outstanding parts were the CGi and special effects so enjoyable and well created.Also the Harry Potter references were nice, lovely and not overdone
It's a overall good movie but not one to rewatch weekly like the other two, it's pretty predictable with more forgettable moments than remembered once's.I really wanted to like it more but it just didn't really worked out for me..."
tt4123432,5.0,"A movie with some solid ideas for character development and a promising overall plotline that constantly loses itself in meaningless subplots and ridicoulus moments of mere fan service. Overall the movie ended up being a visually impressive gathering of missed opportunities.Instead of focusing on Newt, Dumbledore or Grindelwald the writers included screentime filling action for a number of side characters that does not influence the outcome at all. This only prevents the main story from progressing and (apart from the admittedly hilarious sidekick Kowalski) creates passages that you just have to endure.Plus the faceless army of Grindelwald's followers is so utterly incompetent that there never is any real danger to the heroes. They get shot down like puppets in a 15:1 strength ratio, are knocked out by Quidditch balls that wouldn't even cause a twelve-year-old any problems (see Harry Potter Part 2) and get beaten up by a Muggle with a suitcase.The whole ""we meet at Hogwarts to make a plan to save the world""-scene could have been replaced by a simple letter and wasn't any more than an excuse to include the castle in the trailer."
tt8041270,5.0,"Before I went to this film (because my Grandson is nuts about this series of films) I read one newspaper review. It wasn't glowing, but it was positive. Unfortunately, this is a mess. Others have already talked about the issues I have. Granted, this is an empty headed summer movie, it could still have been done with some serious thought. I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes, and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired. Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue. I also didn't see a scratch on any of them. But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine. Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places. I still don't understand how they got into that facility so easily. The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblum's sarcasm. Anyway, it's all been said. This is a poor movie."
tt8041270,6.0,"When I go to a Jurassic Park movie, I want something above all else-hyper realistic dinosaurs in cool environments, seeing them frolic in natural habitat, defend territory, battle other dinos for dominance, hunt humans, and the like. From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.So that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.I have given it six stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place."
tt8041270,5.0,"Colin Trevorrow was so preoccupied with weather he could squeeze all his ideas into a film, he didn't stop to think if he should try and squeeze them all into his film. The narrative is so overstuffed it would fill a Mosasaurus, the action frustratingly lacks any kind of tension, horror or real threat to the main characters and the occasional call backs seen in JW and JW:FK are now as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. That's not to say its a bad film, there's some excellent character moments with the original cast and Jeff Goldblum is brilliant, injecting some much needed humour into this otherwise pretty dry sequel. Being a huge JP fan, this could simply be a case of high expectations getting the better of me but the lack of exhilaration and awe upon leaving the cinema is painful."
tt8041270,6.0,"It's just amazing that no dinosaur hasn't bitten it off yet. In what promises to be the conclusion to the series, all the main cast members of the previous shows are here. ""Alan Grant....... Ellie Sattler"", I actually liked the new characters. DaWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie better than the old ones - they are the only ones that come out of this unscathed. The special effects are, as expected, first class although really? A Gigilomopoloposaurus??? - they just keep getting bigger (the dinosaurs AND the names). Not sure that it's worth the Hollywood Blvd/Times Sq ticket prices ($20+) , but it's an okay way to spend a summer afternoon. I think tho, I'd wait til next weekend when the crowds will be 65% less."
tt8041270,6.0,"I will say this for Colin Trevorrow: unlike other Hollywood writers/directors, who seem to be actively spiteful towards the classic sagas they are writing sequels to, when Trevorrow says he is a fan of Jurassic Park, I believe him.That's why Jurassic World Dominion feels, for good and for ill, like the world's most expensive fan film, cramming in nearly every dinosaur known to man and every character, meme and in-joke from the previous five movies (button up your shirt, Malcom! Get your hat, Grant! Oh look, Nedry's old Barbasol can!).I'm betting that if the great Pete Postlethwaite had not passed away we would have gotten Roland Tembo rappelling from a helicopter to shoot an Oviraptor in the face.The movie is at least twenty minutes too long - Hollywood seems incapable to make a non-bloated blockbuster today, even Bond movies have the running time of The Thin Red Line - and it doesn't have a shred of the wit and intelligence of my beloved first Jurassic Park, but I did like a few set-pieces (the Therizinosaurus, the frozen lake...) and it's always nice to see the awesome Sam Neill back, so I guess the fan bait worked to an extent.6/10."
tt8041270,5.0,"The original 'Jurassic Park' still holds up as a genre landmark (the quintessential dinosaur adventure) and is still a great film in its own way. It has been years since seeing the two 'Jurassic Park' sequels, but do remember not caring for them all that much at all (especially the third film). The first 'Jurassic World' was a lot of fun, though with flaws, and actually liked 'Fallen Kingdom' more than most while acknowledging that it had a lot of issues and that it wasn't great.'Jurassic World: Dominion' did sound interesting and was over the moon to see the original cast reuniting. Despite all of that, 'Jurassic World: Dominion' turned out to be a big disappointment and was something of an uncomfortable experience seeing it in the cinema. To me, it wasn't terrible and not as bad as has been said by some with some good things. But there are also a lot of faults that cannot be overlooked, even when taking the film for what it is and what it was aiming for.Beginning with the good, the scenery is absolutely beautiful and shot with a lot of slick style and atmosphere. There are some good action sequences here and some inventive stunt work, the whole Malta sequence is exhilarating and when the film finally shows some degree of energy. Also standing out in a good way is Claire's very tense horror film-like encounter with the dinosaur. The dinosaurs look absolutely great and show a lot of personality, the predatory ones being very creepy.Some of the performances are good, a wonderfully sarcastic Jeff Goldblum and DeWanda Wise stealing all their scenes. Also really enjoyed the chemistry between quietly charismatic Sam Neill and perky Laura Dern, that evoked a lot of nostalgia. The music score is suitably rousing.However, a lot is wrong here. The script is far too exposition heavy and tends to over-explain, shining only with Goldblum's sarcastic quips. Plus everything with ByoSen is incredibly heavy handed and says nothing illuminating or insightful about corruption. The film is much too long, half an hour could easily have been trimmed which would have been achieved if the story got going sooner and if the climax was shorter. It also drags quite badly, especially the very slight and dully paced first act and the climax does lack tension and felt dragged out, was actually feeling the minutes rather than being enthralled. The whole ByoSen subplot feels like a different film and a marginally more interesting but still heavy handed and convoluted one at that, a lot of the second half does not make sense and left more questions than answers. Wu's part could have been left out completely.Did feel overall that 'Jurassic World: Dominion' could have done with a lot more tension and suspense and quite frankly the later action sequences did leave me feel exhausted and felt too much visually and audibly. There is no heart, charm or soul here, neither are there any brains, which play completely second fiddle to the big and loud approach taken through. The other performances do not convince, Bryce Dallas Howard does her best but has too little to do while Chris Pratt's frequently out stretched do all the emoting. Isabella Ferman came over as annoying and BD Wong is too much in Dr George Huang mode which doesn't gel with the rest of the film. Worst of all is an incredibly bland and a long way from menacing Campbell Scott as the very underwritten and afterthought-like villain.In conclusion, could have been so much better. 5/10."
tt1273235,6.0,"I've written a book and some articles about film censorship, so given the controversy looming around this particular film, and its highly interesting release history in the UK (read wikipedia for more), I got my hands on a pre-release uncensored copy. What's very interesting is that apart from some suggestive shots hinting at pedophilia and the extension of the film's most gruesome, unforgettable scene, it's all there, only left to the imagination - leaving me with the question I've come up with whenever confronted with such a case: if censorship leaves certain aspects to the spectator's imagination, isn't the effect even more stimulating? Yes, 'A Serbian Film' undoubtedly runs for the title of the yuckiest film ever. Yes, it's definitely reveling in the very muck it pretends to criticize, i.e. the complete and total moral decay of our times. I would have very much favored an incorporation of the (presumably Western) consumers of the kind of pornography it deals with, for that remains the film's weakest aspect: the social commentary is quite accurate, but not sufficiently explored.And yet, 'A Serbian Film' is still unmistakably a piece of art. The technical specs are top-notch for such a limited budget. The acting, especially Sergej Trifunovic as psychiatrist-turned-porn producer Vukmir, is nothing short of (disturbingly) wonderful. And most important of all: the underlying anger appears to be real. I was in Serbia for a festival last year (prior to this film's release), and cannot help but remember how similar some opinions and stories I heard were to the views expressed in this film. That being said, I completely understand why Serbs were outraged at this film. Being born in Romania, which has an equal share of ethical bankruptcy, I must admit that if this had been made in Romania, and called 'A Romanian Film', I would be very very mad.This is one of those rare pieces of celluloid which will most likely not allow for any neutral point of view, like 'Mondo Can(nibal)e', or Pasolini's 'Salo', or the collected films of Catherine Breillat. The difference for me is that I usually dislike films of this nature because of their wantonly exploitative nature serving no narrative purpose; that purpose, however, exists in 'A Serbian Film', making it all the more disturbing and relevant."
tt0458352,5.0,"They're really mean! They play keep-away with Andy's phone just after she's given them presents worth five figures. Plus her boyfriend is completely judgy about her job, when she has one of the coolest jobs possible. The magazine (really Vogue) was at the center of our culture back then, and the movie looks down its nose at it. Plus now I can't stand watching Meryl Streep, knowing that she was best buds with Harvey Weinstein. Okay, that's everything I hate about it. The fashions are still gorgeous, and Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are fantastic. It's fun to step inside that glamorous world that doesn't exist anymore."
tt0458352,6.0,"No! Miranda Pristley can say it or merely breath it and the refusal comes as a devastating blow to her eager bunch of minions . Those moments were my favorites in a film that promises a hearty meal but delivers a frustrating bland soufflé. Meryl Streep however, makes it palatable and some times right down delicious. Anne Hathaway , so good in ""Brokeback Mountain"", is so uninteresting here that she manages to survive only when she's sharing the frame with Meryl Streep and that's because we're not looking at her. How can the fairy tale be so uneven, how can we possibly root for the evil stepmother rather than Cinderella. That seems a miscalculation of enormous proportions. All in all I could actually seat through the whole thing again just to see Meryl/Miranda purse her lips."
tt6048922,6.0,"The US has a habit of bending the truth to suit its ends but in this case, it breaks it.""Greyhound"" heavy handidly plays the underdog, with its premise of a destroyer on its first outing taking on an absurdly brazen wolfpack of German U-boats. Its captain is an honest, hardworking, god bothering, sterotype. He'll give no quarter and fight till the end, against overwhelming odds.Now for the reality. The US suffered massive losses in the early days of merchant shipping. The U-boats had a free hand. Indeed, even when the US military started deploying destroyers and the like, to escort shipping, they had no idea how to counter their experienced German adversaries. To make matters worse, their proud admiralty were reluctant to take advice from the British, who had considerable experience dealing with the threat.The notion too, that German U-boats would sit openly on the surface, in defiance of a destroyer or send goading messages, is complete and utter nonsense. Its unfair too, to assume the Germans ""liked"" what they did. Most historical accounts showed they had considerable sympathy for the plight of the men whose ships they sunk. A fate they often shared.On the upside this film is entertaining for those who are oblivious to historical reality. Its paced well, has loads of action and as per usual Tom Hanks fits hand in glove, into his role. Their is no denying the mans acting credentials. To round things off, cinamatography is top notch and the special effects are convincing.6/10."
tt6048922,6.0,"It was just OK which is reflected in my 6 star rating, which I think is generous. They made little effort at any sort of character development. Hanks has some sort of love interest that is hinted at, but that's it. I thought they were going to build some sort of bond between the captain and his Black cook, but that never got off the ground. We know almost nothing more about the man at the end than in the beginning.It's a difficult challenge to portray on film the battle between a destroyer and a submarine. This movie never really pulls that off, it's like listening to one side of a telephone conversation. The German U-boats never seem to be part of the narrative. They try to bring the U-boats in with their radio broadcasts which come across more as obscene phone calls than viable dialogue.Almost exactly half of the dialogue is sailors repeating orders. It got very tedious, very quickly. I thought they went too far in the whole ""navy talk"" department.I found the U-boat attack theme music to be mostly bothersome and heavy-handed, like death wail of a fat man, or a runner-up in Dumb and Dumber's most annoying sound in the world.The sea burial onboard was a moving tribute to our military dead. I couldn't imagine a better resting place than the open sea. I was air force and not really sure what we did. Threw bodies out the back of a C130? That'd be cool with me."
tt6048922,5.0,"Good production, quite intense, very interesting reenactment of a battle at sea, although I am not sure how realistic and accurate it is (those submarines liked to fight a lot in plain sight over the water, right?).My main issue? It was like a documentary, lots of battle time but no much human drama. No time given to develop any characters or even make us feel something about these people.
Ships were sinking in the middle of the Atlantic and we never had a look in the horror of trying to survive this. Even Hank's character felt flat. The few scenes with his love interest were rather awkward and didn't contribute much. At one point we were wondering if the captain was in the spectrum or something..Still, if you are a fan of WWII movies I suggest to watch it for the unique perspective of a battle at sea."
tt11291274,6.0,"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a standard action comedy elevated by meta aspects. Particularly, Nicolas Cage as himself is a great gimmick since he's embraced his meme status. Still, Massive Talent is a missed opportunity because it's otherwise generic. The self-awareness is fun, the self-deprecation works, the Cage/Pascal chemistry is endearing, and the ending is heartfelt. However, the plot is lacking. Massive Talent admits that talky comedy and shoehorned action are lowbrow, yet plays into those tropes. The climax especially devolves into forgettable modern formulas. Therefore, Massive Talent combines wit with mediocrity, making it a mixed bag.Meanwhile, Massive Talent's technicals are minor. There's fitting music, believable production, and blending sound transitions. The editing is noticeable because it serves punchlines and maintains a tight runtime. However, the cinematography isn't proactive, the effects are sparse (besides a young Nick alter ego), and the direction is basic. The tone takes itself just seriously enough, but the presentation of this material is bland. Ultimately, Nicolas Cage's commitment, Pascal's innocence, and the vulnerable family drama drive Massive Talent, but only so far. It's a fun movie that Cage fans should enjoy, but don't expect much else.Writing: 6/10

tt11291274,6.0,"Nicolas Cage plays Nicolas Cage in an action-comedy-thriller about an actor who's paid $1 million to hang out with a suspected drug lord/huge Nic Cage fan (played by Pedro Pascal), and the complications that arise when the CIA simultaneously recruit Cage to spy on him.Does it sound too good to be true? Sort of. I was very excited to see this and hate to admit it, but found it to be a slight letdown.There were definitely positives though. Cage and Pascal are great, and without their committed performances, I don't know if the movie would have much else by way of entertainment value. Things shine when they're on screen together, and I loved their chemistry. Their dynamic made for many of the film's funniest moments, mainly in the first hour. It's in that first half to first two-thirds where the creative premise is a fair bit of fun, and decently executed.Problems come up in the final act. Without too many spoilers, they try to acknowledge the direction it takes with some meta humour, but the meta humour is pretty lazy (meta comedy has advanced to the point where merely being meta isn't enough). Also, the focus on action in that last act wouldn't be a problem if the action was good, but it's weirdly flat and toothless. It doesn't have much bite or excitement or fun to it at all.Still, at least there's some good comedic moments at a few points, and Cage + Pascal make it watchable. I wish it had been a little more consistent and been more engaging when it came to the action/thriller elements though.Even if it's not as wild or fun as it could've been, it's still likely to be a pretty decent time for fans of Nic Cage."
tt11291274,6.0,"This is one of those self aware comedies and its actually ok in terms of entertainment but thats kind of it. Dont get me wrong, it got a smile here and there and the interaction between the two main characters was fun at times but it had long stretches of boring nothingness. The entire kidnapping arc was a drag and the fact that the movie is aware that its a drag really isnt all that impressive... this has all been done before and I am no longer in high school. So that leaves us with the comedic aspect and thats where if fell short. Again, Cage and more so, Pascal were decent but Laurel and Hardy they are not... not even close."

tt0094612,6.0,"Aaaah the late 80s when:  The fact that a character's name is 'Action' Jackson didn't need to be justified. It just was.  We take for granted that Action Jackson is scary and awe-inspiring as peripheral characters tell us so.  Ditto the fact that his passion for his job and creative methods have resulted in him being demoted and his wife leaving him  The bad guy is identified early.  Better still he is already Action Jackson's nemesis.  Better still, still. The guy responsible for his demotion and wife leaving him.  Unexpected and unnecessary nudity was both expected and necessary.  The bad guy has a hot trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and a hot mistress (Vanity).  Both of whom are more than willing to take their clothes off for little reason.Furthermore  Women get out of the shower nude. Guys are wearing jeans.  Performing in a club with a totally see through top isn't noticed by anyone in the club – but those of us watching at home  It doesn't matter if the hero doesn't actually say something funny or clever, as long as he and the other characters seem to think what he is saying is funny and/or clever.  Post-kill quips still need work though, no ""Hasta la vista Baby"" or ""Stick around here"" (though ""How do you like your ribs"" was OK. The answer is apparently 'exploded'.)  Dangerous minions can time their hit and run assassination attempts to coincide with the came split second that their target walks through a door, despite traffic and the fact that they are hundreds of yards away with no possible way of knowing that this was the point he was to emerge  ""I have to catch a cab' means a chase scene, with Jackson not only catching up but giving him a mouthful through the window of his speeding car while still on foot!  Leading to big explosions and certain civilian deaths, none of which are mentioned again.  People get hit in the face and actually bleed. (Happens less on film nowadays than you think.)  Cheesy pop music on the soundtrack is justifiable for the fact that it was the 80s, the spiritual home of cheesy pop music.  Every character actor in the film is recognisable from another classic film of the era. In the first 10 minutes I saw minor roles filled with actors from Predator, Beverly Hills Cop, Red Heat, Back to the Future and seemingly half of the cast of Die Hard.  We know the big showdown will be a fist fight when we see the Bad Guy training in hand to hand combat.  A good body double can make you think that a 60 year old is a karate machine why don't we ever manage to see his face while he pulling off these athletic moves?  Stunt men are plentiful and disposable, and unnecessary CGI is not needed.  Movies were 80 minutes long and had a beginning, middle and end.Final Rating – 6 / 10. None of the above things are bad. Action Jackson is not in the same league as Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and their peers, but it is a solid formula action comedy, which proves that Carl Weathers had genuine on screen likability."

Im just gonna leave it there because his name is just too damn awesome! This is full of explosions, fulls of fist fights, full of awful acting and one-liners and amazingly, has a half decent cast of big name 80's action stars like Bill Duke and Sonny Landham (both of whom appeared in Predator with Weathers and Arnold Schwarzenegger), and Robert Davy (Die Hard, Raw Deal, Predator 2). But the story is basically about Jackson, who has been demoted to a desk cop and hates it, and has to keep his old 'Action Jackson' rebellious days behind him if he want's to be promoted again. When he is trailing a sadistic businessman who is murdering all his union competition so he can take the head job, then you know his 'Action Jackson' gun-ho days are going to return to save the day!

Nelson. Weathers is great, with lots of cool one-liners and macho swagger to spare. For his part, villainous Nelson is appropriately evil and gets to bed young Sharon Stone and Vanity, officially making him the king of all studs. Speaking of Sharon and Vanity, they both appear naked in this, which is reason enough to recommend it. Also features support from Bill Duke, Robert Davi, and Biff from the Back to the Future movies. If you're a fan of '80s action movies, cheese and all, you'll surely like this one."
tt0094612,6.0,"Forget about Apollo Creed from ""Rocky"" and Dillon from ""Predator"", the ultimate Carl Weathers feature is ""Action Jackson"" why because he is the ""star"". He plays a cop not an ordinary cop, but one that has a reputation of doing things his way. Is that out of the ordinary? Ah who cares? Weathers in good fun in the tough as nails role. This time the action is set in Detroit and Weathers finds himself up against a wide-eyed Craig T Nelson. I don't know, but it felt like Nelson was always in some staring competition. It was those unblinking eyes. Truly a fitting bad-ass villainous turn; Hateful, smarmy and he knew how to work his charm. Who does he have working for him; quick moving assassins who look like they are out of some 80s rock band. Bad hair, reflective sunnies and little to say. Maybe it's their second job in between gigs, as they do seem to go missing midway through the film. There are some familiar faces in the cast too; ex-model / singer Vanity gives a sultry performance as a nightclub singer (with a steamy soundtrack to boot), Bill Duke as the hardened police captain that's always on Jackson's back, a unhinged Robert Davi as an old friend and a minor turn by Sharon Stone.The ludicrously pulpy story doesn't break any new ground (sometimes a little too makeshift and contrived), but it's gloriously violent, equipped with smart-lipped one-liners and works in some exciting action set-pieces (Ferrari driving in a mansion) within its urban backdrop thanks to Craig R Baxley's rigidly confident direction."
tt0099939,6.0,"A film whose reputation has only grown in the years since its release, where it was initially a well-reviewed if under the radar event, King of New York is an atmospheric and unique crime thriller that is one of controversial director Abel Ferrara's more accessible pieces of work.Filmed in an almost exclusively night-time/early morning hue, King tells the layered but not overly in-depth story of Christopher Walken's crime boss Frank White, who upon release from a prison stint decides to take back control of his city in anyway he finds possible as he looks to rid the streets of other criminals and corrupt cops as he in turn sets about fixing a city that has let itself get into a state of disrepair and potential ruin.White is the perfect character for Walken's wide-eyed and manic persona, a role that see's the well-liked actor deliver one of his most memorable lead turns, chewing on quotable dialogue and even dancing his way through the screen time King affords him but White remains a relatively aloof figure throughout Ferrara's film as we are kept at arm's length from the inner workings of a figure we would've loved to know more about.What makes White tick? Where did he get his start? What lead him to get caught up in prison? There all questions worth asking but questions we only ever get slight answers to or not at all as Ferrara seems far more pre-occupied with King's stylistic flourishes or the confronting violence that has peppered his long-standing career in the movie industry.In these components, King finds its elements that have led to its increasing standing amongst the 90's pool of cinematic offerings, as Ferrara's unique world view, eye for detail and ability to showcase the vibrancy but also the underbelly of Earth's most famous and renowned cities is front and centre throughout a criminal tale with a difference from many of its counterparts.Alongside this is the noteworthy supporting turns from the likes of a gloriously hammy Laurence Fishburne as White's right-hand man Jimmy Jump, a very early Wesley Snipe's performance as upstart NYC cop Thomas Flanigan with the addition of TV stalwarts David Caruso and Giancarlo Esposito, making King a time-capsule of its period that makes for intriguing watching these 30 or so years on.It's unlikely that today we'd ever see a film like this made, King is a film unto its own and while it leaves a lot to be desired narratively and also fails to emotionally connect, it's an intriguing watch regardless as Ferrara crafts a product unlikely to ever be copied moving forward.Final Say -Not a perfectly rounded whole, King of New York features a quality Christopher Walken performance and a unique few of its titular city making it worthy of tracking down for all those that may've missed it those many moons ago.3 fire hydrants out of 5"
tt0099939,6.0,"Drug dealing gangster Frank White (Christopher Walken) gets released from Sing Sing. Lance (Giancarlo Esposito) and Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) are two of his loyal lieutenants. They kill the Columbians and steal their drugs. Frank kills an Italian mob boss on his way to take over the drug trade. Frustrated narcotics detectives Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), Dennis Gilley (David Caruso), and Thomas Flanigan (Wesley Snipes) are desperate to stop him.Indie filmmaker Abel Ferrara injects this crime drama with over-the-top performances and characters. The most ridiculous is Fishburne. Walken is doing a nice quietly crazy gangster although his character's motivation is a bit confused. He seems to see himself as Robin Hood but he doesn't actually do much Robin Hood work. The characters and the story are all hard-boiled pulpy neo-noir. The directing lacks the polished style. The writing is simplistic. The story telling is rather jagged. Overall, I like Walken's performance and the movie tries very hard."
tt0099939,6.0,"King of New York(1990) is an excellent movie that is Abel Ferrara's most stylish film.  As years go by, King of New York is a film that will be more respected and seen as an example of Ferrara's best work.  It was the second best gangster film in 1990 next to Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas.  The direction is surpurb and the characters are filled with colorful traits.
King of New York(1990) is a modern reworking of the Robin Hood legend.  Its basically about a former drug lord who wants to use drug money to help poor and unfortunate people.  Christopher Walken gives one of his five top best performances in the role of Frank.  The feature is a neo noir because there are no people except for a couple that are likable.
The violence in this film is very brutal and done with plenty of flair. Frank's plans do not work out as everyone is out to get him(espically the police).  Frank is a person who's alive on the outside but dead on the inside.  King of New York has been compared to Scarface(1983) but I believe that this movie is closer in spirit to Ringo Lam's City on Fire(1987) and the two Chow Yun Fat/Andy Lau films of Rich & Famous(1986) and Tragic Hero(1987).
Laurence Fishburne gives a very good performance as Frank's loyal right hand man.  In fact, all of the action sequences involving him makes the actor the Hollywood B-movie eqevulent of Chow Yun Fat with his two gun act.  Steve Buscemi has a bit part as a rival drug dealer.  I only wished that the idea of putting a contract on the police was expanded on with a few scenes of many police officers being assassinated by Frank's men.
One scene that is terrific is the scene where the police dressed up as drug dealers who raid and try to terminate Frank and his gang.  Another excellent scene is the funeral sequence.  The ending is unusually low key for a mafia flick.  I would like to see a director's cut of this film released on video because I feel that something's missing from the R-rated version."
tt0099939,6.0,"The ruthless underbelly of the New York criminal world is examined somewhat graphically in `King of New York,' directed by Abel Ferrara, and starring Christopher Walken.  Upon release from prison, New York crime boss Frank White (Walken), determines to become a major player in the city's underworld and wastes no time in putting the wheels of his plan in motion.  Among the major obstacles he encounters are King Tito (Ernest Abuba) and Larry Wong (Joey Chin), both kingpins of their respective organizations, veteran detective Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), and Dennis Gilley (David Caruso), a young, hot-headed Irish cop who seemingly single-handedly wants to take back the city from the riffraff who control it and seem somehow impervious to prosecution.  None of which matters to White, who is adamant in his quest to become the King of New York. 	Though hard-hitting and excessively violent, Ferrara's film lacks the grittiness of say, Scorsese's `Mean Streets,' or `Taxi Driver,' but nevertheless makes an impact, due mainly to the unfettered violence, as well as the subtle, understated menace Walken brings to the role of Frank White. There's an edginess that permeates the film and the characters who bring it all to life, with the exception of White, who-- as played by Walken-- is the picture of restraint, the eye in the center of the storm.  And it's that cold, soulless, almost haunted look of his that makes him so disconcerting. It's the contrast between his calm demeanor (which threatens to explode at any moment) and the overt violence with which he is surrounded, that gives him that sense of power, and it's also one of the strengths of the film. There is definitely something unsettling about Walken's presence in a role like this (and indeed with many of the characters he's portrayed in his many films); he has a natural ability and the looks-- which he uses so well to his advantage-- to convey the very essence of evil in all it's myriad forms. If they is any doubt, check him out in `Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,' and `Sleepy Hollow,' just to mention a couple.  He has the tools to make you believe his characters, and with adroit skill he uses them all, as he does here with his creation of White; and his performance is one of the highlights of the movie. 	Walken doesn't have the floor to himself in that regard, however, as Laurence Fishburne (billed here as `Larry') gives a memorable, high-powered performance as well, as Jump, White's main man who provides the muscle for his organization.  Fishburne pulls out all the stops and laces Jump with high voltage energy that never runs out, while taking a page from the John Woo Book by brandishing pistols in both hands at once, which serves to enhance his lethal potential.  And his over-the-top, in-your-face attitude is the perfect antithesis to Walken's calm, and is in it's own way just as disturbing in the aloof disregard of-- and lack of respect for-- life.  I guarantee this is one pair of hoodlums you will not soon forget. 	The supporting cast includes Wesley Snipes (Thomas), Janet Julian (Jennifer), Giancarlo Esposito (Lance), Paul Calderon (Joey) and Steve Buscemi (Test Tube).  Ferrara's film is fast paced and relentless, and he adds a nice touch to the ending that contrasts well with all that precedes it, and yet `King of New York,' even with the outstanding performances of Walken and Fishburne, never quite captures that elusive something that would've taken it above and beyond the average crime action/drama.  It does have it's moments, however, and the aforementioned performances alone are worth the price of admission.  Just don't come to this one expecting anything extraordinary; it's a good movie, but the Oscars will have to wait for another day.  I rate this one 6/10."
tt0099939,5.0,"No likeable characters, pretty awful direction and cinematography and i don't even know if there is a screenplay to be honest. Some of the acting was good in parts but for the most part full of overacting and cliché performances.When you compare this to Goodfellas which came out the same year its no wonder it was a box office bomb."
tt0099939,5.0,"I disliked this film immensly because of its low credibility. There is no way anyone can get away with what Frank White does (there are witnesses, tens of them, there is evidence that would make FBI go bananas and catch White within the week) and even if he gets away with it there is no way the police would get away with what they did. Everyone should have simply been caught by the feds and put away.The massacres in the movie would also have been CNN stuff for weeks - overshadowing the Gulf War (if the movie is indeed set in 1990).I also find White´s death disturbing. If indeed he gets away with everything so easily and can outsmart other criminal masterminds so easily, why would a fat stupid cop be able to kill him? It seemed that Frank just had to die and the writer couldn´t find another way to get rid of him for his climactic ending.The movie is somewhat saved by Walken and Fishbourne. I liked Fishbourne's character immensly. He was extremely savage and evil, but he was undyingly loyal to his boss, something which is rare in these movies. Loyalty is a force which is not often used in this kind of movies.I rated this movie 5 out of 10 for the good actors and the very good shootout scenes."
tt0099939,5.0,"Abel Ferrara tries but unfortunately fails to create competition to a genre which is dominated by 'Scarface'. King of New York had the potential to be something great but in the end it only manages to frustrate you.The whole plot in itself is amazingly simple. I mean, where's the originality? A guy called Frank White (Cristopher Walken) gets out of prison, kills everybody just like that (I guess it's that easy, huh) and then he rules New York. Then some cops get angry with Frank because he's a criminal (that's the most deepest part in this movie, cops are supposed to be ""complex"" individuals...) and they decide to kill him. Then there's some shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead.A plot could actually be that simple if there was something extra in it - something interesting to spice things up - a great character, interesting details or ultimately anything to separate this film from the masses. Unfortunately King of New York doesn't have anything to offer in that area. They have obviously tried to deepen Walken's character but they fail miserably. In fact that's the case with all the other characters too. Walken's supposed to be this guy who cares about the poor but this is shown in what, two scenes? Same thing with the police, when they all get killed I don't feel anything because I haven't related to them. Furthermore the dialog is mediocre at best and you can't really call it original.The biggest problem of this movie is that it's not coherent at all. The scenes are in many occasions completely unattached to each other and the whole movie ends up being like a mess. The atmosphere in the film is good - Ferrara is able to depict the brutality and the overall mood well but otherwise the directing is just average. For example the opening scene is way too long. I'd understand it if the movie was an epic or a masterpiece but now it just seems completely irrelevant and tiring to spend at least five minutes following a guy who gets out of prison without dialog. Same thing with the final scene - it drags too long. I guess if you enjoyed the movie the final scene could work but for me after a messy 1,5 hours it just works as an icing in the cake what comes to frustration.I guess the main point I'm trying to say is that this movie had potential but it never delivered. The characters are paper thin thanks to awful cutting and the plot is just oversimplified. In the end this movie offers you nothing but frustration and gore."
tt0099939,5.0,"This Italian-funded production (courtesy of Italian media tycoon and future Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi!) is yet another vicious gangland melodrama from Abel Ferrara: this is actually a slight step up from FEAR CITY (1984; see above) but, for all the film's patent slickness, it is gradually done in by annoying characters, mannered performances and ponderous direction. Christopher Walken has a (self-indulgent) field day as Frank White, a gangster-cum-humanitarian who, when he is not hanging out with his black cohorts and partying up a storm with his molls, is killing off his adversaries in nasty streetfights or rubbing shoulders with elite society at gala dinners. Nothing exactly new then but, to the usual ingredients, Ferrara adds a deafening soundtrack, sleaze, vigilante police officers, sleaze, Asian film-buff/dope-dealers and more sleaze. Having said that, the occasional effectively handled sequence (David Caruso's brutal killing during a fellow police officer's funeral service, the train confrontation between White and his ageing cop nemesis, White's own slightly ambiguous come-uppance, etc.) - shines through regardless. For what it's worth, the film features three early appearances by future stars/notable character actors-to-be: Laurence Fishburne (playing Frank White's right-hand man, an especially irritating characterization as a swaggering thug with a maniacal laugh who just begs to be shot but who, unfortunately for this viewer, does not get his just desserts until fairly late in the game!), Wesley Snipes (as one of the afore-mentioned vigilante cops) and a blink-and-you'll-miss-him Steve Buscemi as a dope ""tester""."
tt0099939,5.0,"Just because you're from New York doesn't mean you have a grasp of how the mob there really works. The proof of that is Abel Ferrara and his fantasy crime drama.The movie is generally entertaining, but too full of typical movie silliness i.e. lack of realism. Walken comes out of jail and he bumps off a major Italian mob boss - just like that. Apparently, Abel hasn't considered the possibility that maybe - just maybe - a top mafia dog might have some sort of bodyguards around him, making it quite difficult to whack him. Cops like Caruso get VERY emotionally touched by the plight of dead criminals that Walken helped exterminate. Why does Caruso have such a soft spot for dead psychopaths? Where were this Caruso and his buddy Snipes BEFORE Walken was released from jail? Was everything hunky-dory back then in NY? Absurd.Then we have the extremely unrealistic scene in which Walken bumps off a cop at a cop funeral! Even better, Walken does this himself (and he escapes without difficulties, in spite of there being 100 cop cars around). It seems Ferrara thinks that mob bosses do all the dirty work themselves, while their highly paid thugs sniff in cocaine and sleep with whores 24/7. The movie also provides us with TWO examples of cops chasing dangerous criminals and appealing to their sense of chivalry to have mano-a-mano duels: Snipes with Fishburne, and then later the old cop with Walken. The old cop previously even has a discussion with Walken about crime in society, in which the latter makes his case for why he is not such a bad guy after all! Not credible at all.This brings me to the movie's fundamental flaw: Walken's mob-boss-with-the-heart-of-gold. Quite clearly, Walken's character has the profile of a typical psychopath - and yet he cares about funding a hospital. There is no explanation given for this, except the implication that he wants to do something for the city of New York. That is just plain silly. And I suppose Walken using the subway regularly shows that he is a ""man of the people"" or something. Malarkey.More problems. Snipes is good as a cop, but I'd rather have seen Fishburne in that role and Snipes as Walken's right-hand man. Fish-born comes off as a snickering clown, almost a parody. I'm sure that Snipes would have come off laughable as well due to the script, but at least he'd be more credible as a gangster than Fishy.The reason I nitpick is that this isn't some standard action film with no pretensions, but is a crime drama, and I expect a certain dose of realism in any drama, whether it be about the mafia or African elephants.I also didn't understand why so much time was wasted on dull MTV-like scenes of gangsters dancing to a lousy rap soundtrack. How is this relevant to the story and how does it build up suspense?"
tt0439572,5.0,"The Flash is a goofy movie. Not only is it much lighter in tone than most of the DC Extended Universe, but it's also wildly uneven, unsuccessfully trying to balance dramatic moments with constant attempts at lowbrow humor. The computer graphics are shockingly bad and are, at times, reminiscent of 2004's The Polar Express. There are some genuinely dramatic parts, when Ezra Miller isn't mugging for the camera, and I'd be lying if I said my childhood heart didn't surge with joy almost every time a Tim Burton's Batman reference was made, but The Flash was, for the most part, a disappointing fizzle."
tt0439572,5.0,"No matter how many times you read about how awful this thing looks, trust me when I say it's worse than you're imagining. Some of these visual effects are absolutely abysmal, potentially the worst I've seen in a movie of this scale. It's honestly on the level of 'Son Of The Mask (2005)' or 'The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl 3-D (2005)' at times. Truly, truly terrible stuff. There are some sequences that are more convincing than others, but too many of them are legitimate eye sores. That's not a dig at the visual effects artists, by the way, who were all very likely doing their best with the time they were given and were also very likely underpaid for their work. It's more of a dig at the studio and its odd decision not to grant the VFX houses more time despite the fact that production on this film spanned the entire nine seasons of CW's 'The Flash (2014 - 2023)'.After a bafflingly bad opening movement, the movie does admittedly settle into its own somewhat entertaining rhythm. The second act of 'The Flash (2023)' is surprisingly successful. It isn't great, of course, but it's relatively pacy and features a handful of enjoyable action scenes. The two cameos that are spoilt in the marketing work fairly well, with a certain someone proving he's still got it even after all these years (though the actor in question has been doing good work for his entire career). Ezra Miller turns in far better work then when they played that wizard with the rubbish hair cut, somehow making Barry more irritating than before but also imbuing him with a new semblance of responsibility that ties in nicely to the story's fairy potent emotional underpinning. However, their efforts aren't quite enough to make you forget all the awful things they've done in real life (nothing would be), so there is a strange sort of second-hand guilt that arises from watching them on screen.Where the picture starts to falter once again is in its final third, which starts out modestly enough but eventually escalates into all-out insanity and begins to awkwardly explore the morally iffy side of its multiversal premise. Again, the ugly visuals rear their even uglier heads here and the very fabric of the film itself starts to (admittedly somewhat appropriately) unravel. The frustrating finale reminds you that the movie has been about IP all along, not genuine storytelling, and that any success its second act may have is either accidental or a result of it being the segment that the DC suits meddled with the least during production. Ultimately, the affair's potential is all but entirely stifled by studio-mandated audience pandering and a callously dismissive approach to the importance of a well-considered narrative.Again, some of the picture really isn't all that bad. In fact, it's actually pretty good; I honestly can't say that I didn't enjoy parts of the middle portion. However, it's bookended by some really poor storytelling and contains more than one laughably bad set-piece. The visual effects are sometimes so poor they look like they've been rendered for a cheap PlayStation 3 game. The movie just feels fairly soulless, too.If you want to see a far, far better adaptation of the Flashpoint storyline, just watch 'Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013)' instead."
tt0439572,6.0,"Finally, The Flash. After all the silenced controversy of its protagonist, one of the most promising films of the last stage of DC comes to light. The film was quite promising, and on balance... it falls short. Join me to find out why without stripping a single spoiler.Let's start from the essential: the script. The story is basic to be a contemporary superhero movie. It contains humor, which feels excessive in the middle of the film. It has a lot of action, from the very beginning of the footage, which is appreciated. But eventually we get to the topic of fashion. On a personal and subjective note, I'm already sick of the multiverse. At least be original and rename the concept! The next movie that dares to close down and make fun of this concept will have my wholehearted support. Anyway, this applies to using time travel of course, and showing a couple of rather impressive cameos.The direction is quite interesting. It has very daring use of angles and lenses that work very well with the story. The photography is effective and the edition is quite precise. The soundtrack is one of the great elements of the film that knows how to deal with nostalgia, but at times it feels too patchy. The acting is decent, as is the costume design.The controversial element of this film is undoubtedly the visual effects. Surely the effects are present in almost the whole movie and almost half of them are pretty bad. The human figure has no real references neither in movements nor in logical details. I have seen video games from outdated consoles with a better visuals than The Flash.Anyway. The Flash is a basic, action-packed movie that tries to be fun and emotional but fails too much in VFX, an element that its target audience is unforgiving in the year 2023.I end by saying that if Muschietti had come even a little closer to The Flashpoint Paradox, this movie would have been a masterpiece."
tt0439572,5.0,"While this movie is entertaining it doesn't introduce any new ideas. It basically rides the trend of every superhero movie that has come out in the past year. They all have a story that deals with time and multiple timelines. This movie unfortunately was released after ""Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse"" and it basically does a lot of what that film did but it did not do it better.There are many scenes where the faces of the characters (mostly the flash) are obviously CGI. There are also scenes where The Flash stops time and it just looks very animated. Namely the scene that involves multiple babies. This didn't take away from my experience but it was noticeable on numerous occasions. There was also a Spanish song used during an emotional scene that didn't fit. It was very random and confusing.Ezra Miller was enjoyable playing different versions of himself and showing his range as actor. He delivered some serious emotional moments as well as some silly comedic moments.Sasha Calle as supergirl felt like a weak attempt at including ""Superman"" into the story and this film would have worked better without it. I didn't hate her character, she was just okay.General Zod was another character that didn't work in this film. I understand why he was included and how he was used to tie together this multiverse idea but he wasn't exciting.The character I had the most fun watching on screen was Batman. Every version of him was just amazing and exciting to see. Every scene that involved Batman felt crisp and well done while The Flash had many clunky scenes. On a side note, Michael Keaton's involvement in this film should have been kept a secret. The trailers continue to show too much ruining movie experiences.There were some cool cameos in this film but as I stated before it has been done before. I expected more from this film considering the amount of times it was delayed. There were some cool scenes and action sequences but this movie needed a better story. The characters just weren't strong enough for the audience to care about them. Sometimes less is more but sometimes a character has such a small role that it's much better not to include them (Iris West).In the end I just felt like I've seen this movie already with different characters. I still look forward to the next film I just hope it goes in a different direction and leaves the timelines alone."
tt0439572,6.0,"The Flash has a bad script. The jokes are self-indulgent. The plot makes no sense. If The Flash can go back in time to save his mom from being killed by a mysterious killer, wouldn't he want to find out who the killer was and capture them? Instead, he just wants to swap out a can of tomato soup so her father would never leave home and she would be alone. Whatever. I'd want to know who the real killer was and capture them and a superhero would too.Suddenly, there are two Barry Allen's and most of the film is cringe annoying dialogue between the two of them that mostly isn't funny.Thankfully, the film picks up when they have to stop General Zod from the Man of Steel, and to do that they have go find more superheroes and the only who who exists in this new reality is Michael Keaton's Batman. And...it's awesome to see Keaton back as Batman.Instead of having two dumb heroes, the film now has at least one hero who uses their intelligence, strength, deduction, and stealth to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Truly a cool thing to see, and easily the highlight of the film and if this is what it took to get Keaton back...at least someone got the job done.Supergirl also shows up and it's actually pretty cool to see two Flashes, Supergirl, and Keaton Batman team up to battle Zod.The final act of The Flash is ambitious and there is enough cool attempts to do something unique that it's hard to dock the film entirely. The real problem with The Flash is The Flash himself, and the writing. This isn't a well written film it has tons of bizarre logic and potholes and stupid unlikable characters...but somehow it all sort of makes something that passed the time and - if for just a moment - made me smile.But, they should have just made a third Keaton Batman movie."
tt0439572,6.0,"It's bad enough I had to put up with one Ezra Miller, but two of them was just two characters and double the cringefest, as the banter between the two characters was more annoying than fun. This film seems like it was targeting a teenybopper demographic that enjoys this type of nonsense.It was all middle-school humor, tacky special effects, silly plot twists that spent all its time racing from one poorly-thought out story element to another, from one only modestly satisfying nostalgia shout-out to another, yet ends up as rewinds of movies you've already seen, but with appalling VFX and a messy story that even the amazing Michael Keaton couldn't save. It was repetitive and underwhelming, and full of narrative inconsistencies and unjustifiable leaps of characters' logic.The multiverse's bottomless stockpile of do-overs and variant replacement characters was already getting on my nerves in the Marvel films, and this DC film suffers from the same bad case of multiverse overkill, instead of telling an original or thrilling story. The stormy seas of production hell are clearly evident as this blur of nonsense runs out of steam as it drags to the nearly two-and-a-half hour mark, that the end result barely feels like a final draft. It's easily the weakest of the recent movies about multiple universes. It's a generous 6/10 all for Michael Keaton and Sasha Calle's screen time and outstanding performances."
tt0439572,6.0,"I really didn't know what to make of this.. I was surprised by the tone, it is much less darker than the other DCEU movies and is tonally similar to Wonder Woman 1984.The opening scene for me rang alarm bells.. the CGI is absolutely laughable with utterly ridiculous scenes bordering of complete silliness. Superman 3 comes to mind. It literally features the worst CGI I have seen in a long time, it felt like I was watching an animated cartoon.The tone then shifts to darker territory briefly when the plot moves along, before suddenly jolting you back to the lighter silliness.Ezra Miller does an ok job in the titular role. He seems to be having fun with the character as does Michael Keaton, who steals the scenes when he finally appears on screen.There are many clever cameos throughout, however brief some may be and it feels like a nice homage to the DC movies of yesteryear.Overall, yeah the CGI was terrible and it tries hard and fails to deliver what Spiderman NWH did much better, but it's a fun ride nevertheless and I did enjoy it."
tt0439572,6.0,"So here it is, the end to the high concept, but ultimately failed DCEU cinematic universe, resetting the timeline for a new cinematic universe, which will undoubtedly be much worse.The Flash starts horribly. We get a random and very silly opening action scene with Ben Afflecks Batman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman appearing for one final phoned in appearance and a lot of extremely bad CGI hijinks. Admittedly, I did chuckle at the baby in the microwave, but the tone is just all over the place.Once Flash moves back in time and meets his younger self, the film goes completely off the rails, with the younger Flash being unbearably annoying. While there is a purpose and a character arc to this, it still grates ones nerves. Ezra Miller overactings, trying his best to do the wide eyed clumsy-fasttalking-annoyingly-likeable thing that Tom Holland does. In some scenes he succeeds, in others he misses the beat. However, he does show some range, with the older Flash generally being a pretty good audience avatar and the one voice of reason.The film miraculously gets back on track once Keaton's Batman shows up. He steals the show in his scenes, but the inclusion of Danny Elfman's musical themes doesn't fit the mood of the film at all and just serves as a reminder of what a beautiful gothic opera the 1989 original was, whereas the Flash is a tonal mess from start to finish.As if the two styles of score weren't bad enough, they place some rock / pop song over a major action scene in a cheap attempt to imitate James Gunn's overuse of pop music in Guardians of the Galaxy.The story of the Flash actually turns pretty good as it moves towards the finale. The character arcs are brilliant, the teambuilding with Supergirl is good, and in her brief screentime she is excellent.During the finale, there are moments of real tragedy, and especially when Barry meets his mother again, the film is legitimately moving and quite sad. If it had taken itself more seriously, this would have been an incredibly powerful finale.One more note on Michael Keaton:
Seeing his performance made me realize what a damn tragedy it was that Warner messed up the Batman IP this badly over the years. We could have had decades of Keaton as Batman, taking on a rogue gallery of interesting villains in Burton's wonderful gothic nightmare city. While Nolan's Dark Knight films were fantastic, Keaton just embodied Batman like no one else.Instead, they wasted time and money on the awful Schumacher films with Kilmer and Clooney (who's cameo here is actually fun), Snyder's failed take on Batman and the watchable but sterile and unnecessary recent series with Robert Pattinson. Warner were sitting on pure cinematic, iconographic gold and didn't realize it.The Flash flopped horribly at the box office. Was it deserved? Yes and no. The film is a tonal mess graverobbing past DC movies while unceremoniously killing off Zack Snyder's high concept cinematic universe. On the other hand, it has a good plot, strong performances and is still leagues above any of the junk Marvel belches out every few months.What does the future hold now? As the superhero genre goes the way of the Western (meaning it's dead in the water), DC will reboot and give us misanthropic garbage from James Gunn, which will undoubtedly be far worse than the past DC films, as it undermines every remotely emotional moment with a joke, be filled with popsongs, random family guy style humor, and probably fail within 5 years. Good job Warner.After the Flash bombed so badly, and with superhero movies on the way out, I doubt DC will ever get back on its feet in the near term. Batman will still be a success if they don't ruin the brand.Who knows, maybe they could do one more Keaton / Burton Batman or bring Nolan and Bale back. Anything other than Batman, and they will lose a lot of money."
tt0439572,5.0,"There are so many things I could say about the film that I don't know where to begin. Most of what I'm going to say will contain heavy spoilers and will often be criticism because the film disappointed me.First, let me talk about the few good parts of the film that I actually liked. Michael Keaton was by far the best in the film. I believe his excellent performance elevated the otherwise bad film. I actually liked Ben Affleck's Batman action scene, albeit very briefly. It gave me some hope at the beginning of the film, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to that. I quite liked Sasha Calle's Supergirl. She was the best in terms of action, and I hope she doesn't get recast unnecessarily because I really liked her. Overall, I think the issues with the DCEU lie more in the scripts rather than the cast. Ezra Miller was just okay, nothing special, in terms of his acting.From here on, what I'm going to say will be purely critical. First and foremost, the film had some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. Despite all the delays, corrections, and previews, the CGI was simply unacceptable. I didn't like the color palette and the choice of locations for the action scenes either. Especially in the Zod fight, the selection of the location (green screen) was incredibly poor. I didn't like the editing of the time travel scenes. The way they handled the parallel universes, as well as visualizing the flow of time, was terrible. There were too many jokes, making it difficult to establish an emotional connection. However, none of these were my biggest issue. Despite overlooking the CGI, editing, and directing errors, I couldn't get past the absurdity and the badness of the final scene. Let me explain: there are three versions of Flash in the end, and the film has reached its climax, with Zod being in an unbeatable situation and already giving some cameos, yet when you expect an impressive last fight with meaningful and scientifically plausible dialogue, they present a childish dialogue like ""It's your fault, Nexus"" with empty dialogue. The idea of resetting the universe in such a simplistic and bland way is just terrible. I felt embarrassed, truly embarrassed, while watching that final scene. With already terrible CGI and cameo designs, the overly simple and uninspiring ending made me incredibly sad. Additionally, after somehow dealing with the Nexus, seeing George Clooney in an unrelated manner felt out of place. If they were going for a semi-reset, should it have been handled like this? I don't know.In short, the presence of a few good actors and actresses couldn't save the film from being a disaster due to extremely poor writing, directing, and editing. Whether it's Flash creating the Nexus, the fight scene colors, CGI, or the resolution of the events, including the attempted universe reset, everything was poorly executed, and I didn't see any directorial vision. It was a straightforward film.I believe people get carried away by small surprises and nostalgic intoxication. Yes, nostalgia feels sweet, and the cameos may make you go ""Wow,"" but the overall coherence of the film has changed so much that it cannot maintain consistency in either time travel or other aspects. I wish they had turned the film into a darker tone from the beginning rather than turning it into a jigsaw puzzle. Maybe then, the trio of Sasha Calle, Michael Keaton, and Michael Shannon would have shined even more. While the idea may be Flashpoint, this isn't a Flashpoint film; they just whispered ""Flashpoint"" in the film's ear. The DCEU has significantly lowered my expectations and disappointed me. Hopefully, James Gunn can bring a solution to this chaos and the incomplete reset. I can't deny that I miss Zack Snyder's colors and style.Update: I want to make an addition, I saw an explanation after the movie. So, apparently, they intentionally made the CGI bad in the scenes with time travel because that's how it looks from Flash's perspective or something like that. I've heard very few things as absurd as deliberately making CGI bad. The film's budget seems to be 200 million dollars, which is quite a significant amount. It's strange to me that people believe everything the studio and director say. I mean, the explanation for the scene where Flash extends his head through the portal shouldn't be that they intentionally made the CGI bad."

Although there are bumps between the characters along the way, eventually, we'll solve the problem""The interesting twist is *supposed* to be that instead of classic superheroes, we have bad guys.

tt1386697,6.0,"Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on the hype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great concept that we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For some reason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release. This movie suffered from all fronts, poor writing which is the number one problem for me. The story was just all over the place with such in coherency, it's visible at every point. Not enough time was spent in developing these characters for their introduction to the big stage. Poor dialogue was another major problem which is just so stupid at some points. But Suicide Squad still could have been saved with the main plot and a great villain. Sadly that too was a major problem. The main plot didn't make sense because the movie itself went in so many directions that none of it could have come together and gel.The villain was a total failure. Nothing about this person was intriguing and just falls so flat. Story and main purpose was so awful for a big summer blockbuster. This movie probably only had about two things going for it. Majority of the casting was great including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto, and Jai Courtney. Yes Jai Courtney, I'm shocked too. I really think his role should have been expanded. Notable miscast would be Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne. Joel Kinnaman portrayal of Rick Flag was out of touch of what that character should be and for Enchantress, someone, more older with more acting depth should have been chosen over Cara Delevingne. The other thing would be, through and through it's a much better movie than Batman V Superman. I know that's not really helping but still. A weak six stars and a onetime watch."
tt13521006,6.0,"If you think of this movie as a nightmare it makes more sense. When you dream, your brain processes deep emotions and fears. Things like guilt, shame, childhood fears (spiders, strangers, water, the woods, etc.) and a lot of times the narrative is confusing and all over the place. This basically sums of the movie.It's hard to review or summarize, but essentially it's a journey into Beau's subconscious. Fear of sex, mommy issues, shut down emotions, and unresolved trauma.I sometimes gauge a movie based on how many times I think about it after I've seen it. For this one, I've been thinking about it all day. There are some really creative, artistic scenes and shots also that keep the viewer interested. Overall it's disjointed and way too long, and definitely not for everyone. 6/10."
tt13521006,5.0,"Artistic styles come in two basic forms. You have your more lifelike art, which is meant to capture a moment in time through the imagination of the artist. The other is abstract art, wherein an artist has no intention of spoon-fooding you what to think, but is hoping to manipulate your feelings.And it's not binary. Most art falls into a spectrum somewhere in between those two extremes.If you've ever seen a David Lynch production like Eraserhead you'll recognize the abstract side of that spectrum, because you'll realize the futility of sorting out an actual plot. David Lynch, like sometimes directors David Cronenberg (Videodrome, eXistenZ, etc) and Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, etc) or writers like Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, etc), confuses reality on purpose and likes characters who roll with it, so that you have no choice but to roll with them. They have no intention of making sense. Their movies are often an attempt to throw off your sense of reality and ask you to simply except what you're seeing instead of try to understand it.Beau Is Afraid falls into that category, but nonetheless, I'm going to try to understand it anyway.This movie spends its entire time inside the mind of a man who clearly suffers from extreme anxiety, but it's hard to pin down what exactly it is that he's afraid of. And unlike movies like David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch, we're offered no obvious reason why Beau is seeing some of the weird things he sees. Is he schizophrenic? Maybe. Ari Aster does not want to answer that question, he wants you to ponder on multiple possibilities. And like most art that leans on the abstract side of the spectrum, each viewer is likely to reflect differently on it, and come up with their own answers (if any at all).From what I could tell, there were many clues in the movie that seem to imply that his anxiety disorder is caused by something sexual. A sexual trauma, perhaps. From graphic graffiti at in the earlier sequences, scenes where he is attracted to a girl his age but believes he will die if he has sex with her, and a creature his mother calls ""his father"" locked in an attic that is basically a monster made out of male genitalia, the movie is riddled with disturbing sexual references. (Not unlike something Cronenberg would do.)And his mother seems to be at the center of this problem. He behaves in a way that is constantly befuddled, and apparently victimized by every possible circumstance he stumbles into, but it all seems to have something to do with the way his mother treats him. Each sequence of the movie is another angle at the same problem, but in very different ways, and with perhaps red herrings to throw you off the scent.In one very key shot, apparently a flashback, there was a POV scene of him in a bathtub and the young girl he has a crush on is sitting at the side of the tub, she gets up and exits the frame, but the camera pans over to see his mother entering the frame from the same direction - and approaching his young self. (He is effectively outside of himself observing his relationship with his mother.) His mother tries to remove his clothes for bath time and he resists, asking for his father. (It's not clear why he wants his father. Certainly not to undress him. My feeling is it was for protection. Why would a boy his age need to be undressed by his mother?)The reason I think this is important is because I think the director is signaling to us that his mother might have sexually abused him through much of his childhood, and lied to him about his father and about his own sexual health in order to keep him tethered.But yet there was an earlier scene wherein he was imagining himself in a play where he actually found a wife and had kids with her, and occasionally this wife looked like a man. (This man, we learn later, is identified as Beau's father.) Beau spends an entire lifetime in this staged story looking for his lost wife and kids (who had disappeared after a terrible flood) and finally he meets up with his sons all grown up. That this was framed as a stage play is no accident. It was an imagined reality.Something about all that makes me think he had an intuition of being lied to all his life, and that his father represented the truth: that he could have a family all along. But we don't know what really happened to his father, and whether the man he met at the traveling theater was even real. Either way, his mother was very mean and impatient with him, and manipulative. She did not seem to approve of his natural interest in girls, and even seemed to enjoy watching him flirt with the idea of being with girls to see how it would play out.It was she who frightened him into a life-long resistance to find love in the arms of another woman. When he finally broke down and at least believed he had intercourse with that childhood crush, now grown up and played by Parker Posy, and did not die, we learn that his mother apparently observed (and probably set up) the entire thing. When the girl died (at least figuratively), his problem shifted from having fears of himself dying to a feeling of terrible guilt for ""killing"" the woman he loves - a role which I think his mother insists on filling.The final sequence was his trial, but unfortunately there was no redemption to be found here. Disappointingly, it appears he symbolically lost his battle with anxiety, false-guilt and low self esteem, and his mother won. No payoff to be found for the poor audience, who has sat through 3 full hours of this!All in all, I would have rated it higher if the film was about 1 hour shorter and his long, painful journey of self discovery and failure to stop the pattern of ""self incrimination"" and ""guilt"" due to probably sexual abuse was rewarded at the end with something happier, something psychologically triumphant. But it wasn't. It was like watching someone die of cancer and then die without fixing anything in his life. So why was I taken on this ride into hopelessness? It's not like Phoenix's Joker character which was a portrayal of a man who chose evil due as a response to his unfortunate medical condition and the cruelty of life. The character of Beau went absolutely nowhere and changed nothing. He just learned the truth about himself, and his mind judged him guilty despite all that.The movie is labeled a comedy and a horror, which is not quite accurate. It was satirical in many places, perhaps intending sarcasm about the violent world we live in. But it was neither that funny nor that scary. I'd have simply called it a psychological drama and satire.Phoenix is an absolutely amazing actor, but I would have advised him to take another look at the third act and insist on a stronger payoff."
tt13521006,5.0,"Couple things:1. I don't like being negative about movies.2. I love when filmmakers and creators take big risks and make original, creative movies that we haven't seen anything like before. Watching directors take huge swings, even when they miss, is infinitely more compelling than safe mediocrity.That being said... I thought Beau is Afraid was terrible. I might even say... unwatchable.And that really disappoints me. I love seeing big risks pay off and love to champion those films, and I really hate having to say I didn't like a movie. I'd usually give a wildly original film like this the benefit of the doubt for taking a big swing even if it doesn't fully pan out... but to me, Ari Aster missed the mark in every possible way with this film. The film felt like it was someone telling you all the unnecessary details of a nightmare they had as you slowly lose interest. The story had no rhyme or reason, and stuff just kept happening that never made sense to me. I really admire the originality and the skill behind the camera - it is still a technically well-made movie, and Joaquin Phoenix really commits to the role. The movie does do a good job of immersing you in the psyche of its protagonist. But overall, it just did not work.This is a perfect example of when art-house cinema becomes too much - the movie is inaccessible. If I as a cinephile struggles to get through the third hour of the movie, I can't imagine what it must be like for a member of the general moviegoing public. Like, the first 45 minutes were promising, but everything after was almost unbearable. Nothing worked for me, and I even questioned whether I could sit through the rest of it. The movie is far too long and is a slog to get through. It is also so obnoxiously self-indulgent. I do need time to digest it and think about it, but overall my gut feeling is that this movie really did not work for me. To me, it was terrible, which is such a surprise since I thought Aster's previous films, Hereditary and Midsommar, were quite excellent (albeit disturbing).I see why this film is so divisive, and I am very upset to say that I ended up on the negative side on this one. It's 100% an original and unique movie - I've never seen anything quite like it......but maybe that was a good thing."
tt13521006,5.0,"Beau is Afraid is going to be hit or miss for a lot of people. It's the type of movie that many will praise and criticize for the exact same reasons. Some will find Ari Aster's visceral, nonstop, in-your-face shock and awe absolutely brilliant. Some will find it grotesque, some hilarious, and some will probably just find it plain monotonous. Regardless of where you land personally, I think fans and haters alike will admit it's easy to understand all of those opinions (and more) on the fever-dream, bad-trip, crisis-coaster that is Beau is Afraid.There are some ideas in this movie that absolutely hit home. The central character, Beau's, downright Fredian psyche is thought provoking and forceful, if not overstated. The movie looks wonderful throughout and showcases phenomenal cinematography. There is also a fantastic black comedy element that I wasn't expecting - both the wry smile kind and laugh out loud type. Beau is Afraid is packed with amusing subtleties that make me want to rewatch the movie just to see what details I missed. On the surface level, this movie considerably richer than Aster's previous two; it feels as though there is so much more to explore here.What falls short for me isn't any one glaring detail, it's the sum of all the film's parts. It's a rambling, full speed ahead journey it that lasts an excruciatingly long three hours (two hours and fifty-nine minutes, to be exact). This ride doesn't feel like a edge of your seat thriller, it feels like a highlight reel of nightmares loosely strung together. Frustrating, inarticulate, and logic resistant. At points it feels like Aster is openly testing the audience's limits and patience, fully leaning into the fact that many won't hang on until the end.Kafka-esque is spot on. Beau is Afraid is largely without a plot; the viewer is forced to most of the legwork if they want to reconcile any sort of direction. This could have worked in a smaller dose, but after the two hour mark you start to wonder why there is still so much movie left. Aster's audience engagement leans heavily on visuals and surprises, and somewhere along the three hour journey you start to wonder if that's quite enough.You don't know what's coming in Beau is Afraid, but as the formula reveals itself you do know that entire movie is about to be turned on its head. Again. And again. And again. Watching the story bounce from one introspective non-sequitur to the next is a rather unrewarding experience. Even though a resounding lack of closure is surely supposed to be a deliberate point of the film, I had to question if I was enjoying it.There's a very good movie in buried somewhere in Beau is Afraid, but it's layered under a heavy, heavy dose of self indulgence. It doesn't need to be so long, or so frenzied, or so indirect. Aster's core message simply isn't as profound as he makes it out to be. But it's a new side of Ari that we've never seen before and, for many, that alone will make it worthwhile experience. And the movie isn't without a good deal of genuinely redeeming qualities that fans of the genre (if you can narrow it down to just one) will surely enjoy. It's a thought provoking, visually stimulating trip that you should really just experience for yourself. Though perhaps on-demand with the fast forward button within reach, just in case."
tt13521006,6.0,"This is Ari Aster's worst film. That's not to say it's bad, but it's his worst.The beginning of the movie starts off with this incredible burst of energy.Beau is this lonely guy talking his problems with a therapist and living in this dumpy apartment in some unnamed large city.But it's also a commentary on societal downfall and policymakers stupidity.It is absolute chaos in the streets. Broad daylight mayhem.It's like Idiocracy with extreme violence.And to be honest, it's entertaining as all get out.The first brilliant half hour to hour of this three hour monstrosity's runtime is when it's running at its full-tilt best.The apartment. The mayhem. The message on where society is heading and but fast.All of this is well received.Is this the Best Movie of 2023?Am I witnessing the Greatest Movie of the 2020's?In the first hour or so, you'll be out of your seat and thinking of spots to get this tattooed on your body.Then we enter the second hour or chapter as it may be.This is where Nathan Lane and Amy Ryan are introduced, and I love them.Absolutely love them. By themselves in other projects, and here together even.Love.But this is where the film slows considerably and gets weird, and not in your typical Aster good weird, but here just plain sad, depressing, nonsensical weird.And once Lane and Ryan have played their parts to the fullest in the middle of the film, audience members may start wishing there was a good editor making the hard choices in the house at A24.In the third and final hour, Parker Posey emerges, in what is no less her most stunningly amazing performance of this century.She is as gorgeous and incredible as she ever has been, though her scenes are short in this literal journey of a tale.Patti LuPone truly takes over from where Posey leaves off and devours the remaining scenery in what is definitely her finest performance ever on celluloid.But the story by now has devolved and is way too prolonged having lost its promise from the first hour so seemingly long ago.The ending in the most kindest of terms is a monumental disappointment.All the great filmmakers in history make a bad film sooner or later.Let's hope this will be Ari's one and only.Beau Is Afraid. But his movie is too often boring, overly long and unnecessarily grotesque."

If something strange or jarring can happen, it will happen. With that being said, there are certain aspects of this film that are undeniably great whether you like the overall narrative. This film has genuinely funny moments. The scene in the connivence store made me laugh out loud. This film also has many shots and sequences that are just downright beautiful. The animated sequence that goes through the different play sets and the imaginary life of Beau was mesmerizing. The sequence of Beau traveling on the motor boat in the pitch black was amazing. My main issue with this film aside from the 3 hour runtime was that I think it did too many things that were weird for the sake of being weird instead of for the sake of advancing the plot."
tt1637725,6.0,"Ted has gained popularity in India due to its light and charming nature, earning a place on my watchlist for nearly a decade. Since it was leaving the OTT platform, I finally decided to indulge myself anticipating a great movie.It began promisingly. Mark Wahlberg's remarkable acting skills were evident, although this might not be his finest work. Mila Kunis was also appreciated in her role.The movie unfolds with a series of conflicts, but it becomes evident that these conflicts will arise between the protagonist and his relationship with his girlfriend considering there was a ted / the best friend. The predictable nature revolves around these conflicts with Ted eventually making up for them.The film provides light-hearted comedy, and Ted's character, with his crazy antics, adds a sense of enjoyment. However, the movie failed to meet my expectations, feeling rather average.In essence, Ted offers a fun and enjoyable experience, predominantly relying on comedy to entertain the audience. If you appreciate comedy, the film is likely to amuse you, but those seeking more substance may find it less engaging."
tt1637725,6.0,"Whilst I did not dislike 'Ted' I cannot say I was overly impressed by it. The hype and popularity that built up towards the film's release had me expecting something fresh, something that would keep me laughing days after. To my disappointment, 'Ted', to me, turned out to just another Rom-Com, its only real unique twist being Ted himself. Having said that, 'Ted' did provide some good laughs, whilst they weren't exactly side-splitting the film was entertaining and I did watch the entire feature without getting bored or uninterested. The animations for Ted were of a good quality, doing a good job in making it seem like Ted was actually there with the actors, rather than just a computer-generated 3D image. What I felt let 'Ted' down was it's predictability and lack of memorable or unique laughs. Being rated as a 15, 'Ted's plot didn't seem to suit it's targeted audience, I have seen similar story lines in films rated PG or even U but the explicit content of 'Ted' was clearly intended for more mature audiences, therefore I felt it deserved a more mature plot. Overall, I'd recommend 'Ted' to those who are looking for a relatively light-hearted story with a few giggles added in and a cursing, yet somehow still lovable, teddy bear. It's good, but nothing overly special."
tt1637725,6.0,"¨No matter how big a splash you make in this world whether you're Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, Justin Bieber or a talking teddy bear, eventually, nobody cares.¨Since 1999 Seth MacFarlane has made a name for himself in television thanks to the success of Family Guy. He's also the man responsible for other successful animated series such as American Dad and The Cleveland Show. He's not only the creator of these shows, he also voices many of the characters as well. In his first venture into live action film he also voices the star of the movie: Ted, a teddy bear that magically comes to life after a lonely boy makes a wish. Ted is an R-rated comedy due to the fact that he happens to be very vulgar and getting stoned all the time. The film has had huge box office success in the United Stated and I was expecting Ted to be hilarious, but I guess my expectations were a little too high because I wasn't blown away by this movie. There were some funny scenes, but for the most part the film felt like an average comedy and it wasn't what I was hoping for. 2012 has failed to deliver a successful comedy, and for now 21 Jump Street reigns as the best one in my opinion. Ted is full of irreverent humor, but it's repetitive and you have the usual sexual, drug, and poop jokes. I couldn't find much originality to it, but I do have to say some of the scenes did work thanks to Ted and his best friend played by Mark Wahlberg, whom I've always said is great in comedies. This is a pretty formulaic buddy comedy where you have the typical two slacker best friends and a girl who gets in the way of their friendship and wants them to mature. The only difference is that this time around one of them is a talking teddy bear. The film begins with a narration (voiced by Patrick Stewart) about the story of lonely boy who gets his wish one Christmas morning when he asks for his teddy bear to become his best friend. When the teddy comes to life, John Bennett (played by Mark Wahlberg, and the younger version played by Bretton Manley) discovers that he has found his best friend who he names Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane). Ted becomes an instant celebrity as he is all over the news and is invited to all kind of talk shows. Ted changes young John's life for the better. The film then jumps to the present day where both have grown into adults. John is now 35 and has a healthy relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis). They've been dating for four years now. Ted is still living with John and has also grown up in the same way that his human buddy did. John and Ted like to spend time getting high together and talking about girls, drugs, and Flash Gordon. Everything seems to be going well for the trio until Lori gives John an ultimatum. It's Ted or her. Lori realizes that Ted is keeping John from realizing his full potential since they're always getting stoned and John is always late to work. John realizes that he has to make an important decision if he wants to save his relationship with Lori and the movie moves along from here. One of the things the film explores well is the transition from child to adulthood. We don't only see John grow up, but his teddy bear as well. Now being an adult doesn't mean you're mature and John and Ted are proof of that. They are irresponsible and practically only care about getting high all the time. They both are very nice people, but really immature. That's what drives Lori crazy, but the good thing about Ted is that these characters aren't stereotypical. Lori isn't a mean person who wants to separate the two best friends, but rather wants them to take responsibilities as adults. Ted also has character development and despite the fact that he's very inappropriate he also has a big heart and wished the best fro John and Lori. This isn't your typical face off between best friend and girlfriend. I was pleased with that aspect of the film. Another thing that worked really well for me in this movie was all the references to different films (especially Flash Gordon and Top Gun) and jokes about them. As a film lover you always enjoy those small references and gags. Some of the cameos were also pretty funny and highlights of the film. What I didn't like as much was the fact that some of the sexual and drug humor got a little bit repetitive and old. There were also several poop and fart jokes which are always a little repetitive in these buddy comedies. Ted is still a funny film, but just not the hilarious movie I was hoping for.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
tt1637725,6.0,"Have you ever wondered what Peter Griffin would sound like with a Boston accent? Well the talking teddy bear Ted is the answer in Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's directorial debut, Ted. MacFarlane provides the voice of Ted in this raunchy comedy about a young boy who makes a Christmas wish that brings his stuffed teddy bear to life. But, as the boy grows up, so does Ted. Jump forward twenty years to the story of a grown man balancing work, a girlfriend, and his best friend Ted the teddy bear.Ted is raunchy, vulgar, crass, and culturally relevant. It's a comedic styling much in the vein of Family Guy or any of MacFarlane's other shows, just pumped up with R-rated steroids. From the start with this film's wacky premise we know that it doesn't take itself too seriously and is really only here to deliver the laughs. It's a fairly predictable film and it's plot is very Hollywoodized at times, but it's also pretty damn hilarious. MacFarlane's off brand humor is where this film is successful, as one would expect. However, in about five or six years half the jokes in Ted will no longer be relevant as there are a lot of pop culture references littered throughout this film that will mean nothing in only a few short years.But for now practically all of Ted is absolutely hysterical. It's lots of foul language, plenty of potty humor, and a plethora of dirty sight gags that make Ted tick. Also, a fine helping of cameos keeps the humor fresh and increasingly hilarious, whether or not it makes any sense at all. Sometimes it's really just Seth MacFarlane showing off how far his Hollywood star power tentacles can reach, but none of it falls flat. In fact, very little of the humor in Ted falls flat. I really enjoyed this film. It's nothing more than another raunchy comedy, but it certainly entertained me, and what more need I ask for?"
tt31049718,5.0,"I am a Florida Trail hiker. I know the area he died. The only real mystery you'll find in Mostly Harmless' story is the struggle to identify him. I do not know why the media continues making his death some grand mystery.Here are the real facts. He would have known there was a road, a tourist-filled animal adventure park, and even a town with emergency services just a half-day's hike away; because that is the direction he came from! If he had an emergency (i.e. Caught giardia) and was able to hike out, he could have just turned around from where he came from and went for help. A fatal snake bite is a high possibility, but an autopsy report would have shown that.What likely happened is he starved himself on his journey southward to such a frail state that he ended up getting heat stroke that was fatal. He probably had not been drinking, felt delirious and cold, so he went inside his tent to lay down, lost consciousness, and that was it... The time of year and conditions are brutal, and there is some uncertainty about his water filtration/supply. It is possible he was also rationing water because he did not want to drink water from the swamp and canals.The only unanswered question about this case is: Was the starvation intentional (to end his own life) or was the starvation due to his hubris and penny-pinching? He was unprepared for basically the entirety of his journey. Was he just trying to just be cheap and buy/eat as little food as possible? He was known to work for free meals along the way, despite having more than enough cash to make it to Key West (his final destination where he wanted to get a job). He was likely saving that cash for rent money and refused to buy basic supplies, having previously had an eating disorder where he refused to eat, he would be accustomed to it.Either way, it is a sad story, even if he was (supposedly) outcasted for being violent toward other people in his past. I just personally don't believe there is anything very mysterious here other than a story that makes people gossip."
tt31049718,5.0,"This starts out like a yesteryear HBO production but quickly devolves into something you would see on a daytime true crime network. It's difficult to recommend this to really anyone at all, because it lacks so many of the components that used to make HBO stand out amongst its peers. What you end up with in this documentary has very little to do with what you are pitched in the trailer. This is 30 minutes of mystery regarding the identity of this nameless hiker followed by an hour of several embittered older women fighting with one another over moderator status on Facebook groups.What is actually alarming about the movie is not the content, but how far people will go to make sure there is no privacy in this world at all. Yes, the subjects of this movie find out who ""Mostly Harmless"" is at the end, but at a cost. I call these internet sleuths ""subjects"" because the director clearly deviated paths at some point during this production. What started as a documentary on a dead hiker turned into a lazy character study on several older women who had little to live for other than this story. Thus, the ""subjects"" of the movie were the women who helped find out who this gentlemen was, while engaging in a virtual slap fight in the process. I am loathe to discuss that part of this film because it gives these women more of an audience than they really deserve. But it's what the director ultimately settled on to stretch this from an hour to an hour and a half. Show or movie. That was the dilemma. He made a movie, which meant filling that thirty minutes. As a show, this could have worked. As a movie, it did not.Of note, we do learn who ""Mostly Harmless"" is and we also learn that he has a troubled past and apparently felt he had a troubled future. All signs point to him having starved himself to death as a means to end his own life. This was despite having several apparently meaningful interactions during a year+ hike on the Appalachian trail. Several of the people he interacted with ended up being interviewed for the documentary, but none proved helpful in ascertaining who he was. It was ultimately a DNA study and subsequent pamphleting of his Louisiana town that uncovered his identify.In the end, this movie begs an important and very sad question. The man in this movie did everything he could to go off the grid and to die, alone and unknown, on his own terms. What he got instead was the exact opposite. Thousands of people rallied together to identify him and then, after his death, several other people claimed he was a terrible person. Of course, those people only came out of the woodwork once the story was known and notoriety was to be had, but even taken as true, one has to wonder what purpose this story served. This gentlemen clearly wanted nothing more than to fade into the abyss. Instead, he got sleuthed by a bunch of people who were more worried about Facebook moderator status than anything else. And then, in death, his entire life was unearthed and made public. That unearthing showed a guy who struggled with mental health for 41 years and sought to end his own life, maybe as penance and maybe as something else. It's truly none of our business, and it pains me to have watched this documentary and realized that my viewership was part of what this man sought to avoid.This film is certainly ""documentary"" in nature in the sense that it tells a story. But the story is not what one expects, nor is it anything most people would care about. Had the focus been on ""Mostly Harmless"" and not on the women who could only be described as absolutely harmful, it could have been good. But, alas, this is the new HBO. And the new HBO is quantity over quality. There is plenty of quantity here, but the quality is not what it once was.Shame on you HBO for phoning this one in. Perhaps a show would have been better than a movie this time around."
tt31049718,5.0,"I knew about the Mostly Harmless investigation and loosely followed it so going into it I knew where the documentary was headed, or at least I thought so. Really it's a documentary about some of the people who met him on the Appalachian Trail and forum moderator drama. There is so much forum moderator drama in this documentary.When the 'twist' happens and you find out that Mostly Harmless was actually abusive towards women it gets glossed over. None of the details of his abuse are revealed and it quickly cuts to the people who met him on the trail saying that the Mostly Harmless they knew was a nice guy. Then cutting back to the forum moderators.If the documentary wanted to be adjacent to the actual story of Mostly Harmless the hiker they could have split it into two parts. The investigation into finding out his identity and then the aftermath when they realize they spent years finding out he wasn't actually a good person.For the actual story of Mostly Harmless read the 2021 Wired article by Nicholas Thompson, ""The Unsettling Truth About the 'Mostly Harmless' Hiker."""

This story strip away the myth of connectedness in modern world and introduce the lonely lives that exists in shadows. Retrospectively the sleuths of whom most are falling into the aforesaid shadow realm put up a wholesome collective effort that gives a John doe a name that he himself wanted the world to forget. It's sad yet a mysterious venture of social detective work. A story told well methodically and cleverly. Rather than making a regular true crime doc this sleuthing odyssey is a unique and an inspiring social commentary.
tt31049718,5.0,"This was an interesting story but the internet ""sleuths"" who were obsessed with the case are a bit much. Don't get me wrong, well meaning interest helps people get identified in police cases. People like Christie who only live vicariously through other's trauma are ridiculous. Here's a woman who spends half her life getting involved in cases she knows nothing about, to the point of harassing people. Christie tried to take full credit for getting this man identified, which isn't her credit to take. Her constant crying and acting the hero is extremely off putting.I can't imagine having so little of a real life yourself that you'd insert yourself in anything just to get attention. But then again, this is the story of the internet age. People can create their little FB groups and effectively harass people who have nothing to do with a case. That's probably the most disturbing takeaway I got from this.Very little was said about the actual victim himself. This appeared to be more of a showcase for the nut jobs like Christie.Others who were interested showed a more even keel. This is not the quality documentary that HBO usually creates. The story was interesting UNTIL it demonstrated that well meaning people like Natasha are overshadowed by the Christies of the world."
tt31049718,6.0,"I very much enjoyed this documentary, many interviewees who were dedicated to finding out who ""mostly harmless"" really shows that the hiking community is a hodgepodge of people. As per Max, the film had amazing scenes and shots of nature, and they don't show any graphic photos of Mostly Harmless's dead body. However, the main person who really started the whole internet fascination (Christie) seemed so hypocritical and holds a superiority complex that carries throughout the entire film. From being extremely controlling to flat out cyber bullying someone just because she saw them as a competitor in solving Vance's death, Christie almost ruined the entire documentary for me.Christie gets very emotional when she thought she found who Mostly Harmless was, and puts up a ""poor me"" act after she basically organized an entire group to harass the moderator of Christie's previous Facebook group. The rest of the documentary is basically her weeping about poor ol' Vance and her dedication to his case while completely ignoring her own abusiveness towards those who wouldn't let her have full control of them and/or Vance's case.Another thing to note that others have pointed out, several of the people interviewed were in such disbelief that this warm, soft spoken hiker was actually an abuser that they all but disregarded the evidence to mourn the death of someone they thought they knew from a few interactions. Christie herself states that Vance's death absolutely was not a suicide, nor did he abuse his previous girlfriends.Internet sleuths themselves are extremely invasive towards people who they think are somehow related to whatever it is they are investigating, and Max's documentary shows that very well. ""They Called Him Mostly Harmless"" is definitely worth a watch if you can get passed how cringe Christie is. I'd certainly recommend it to friends in the future."
tt31049718,6.0,"As a fan of various YouTube mystery and crime channels, I recall the tale of Mostly Harmless popping up from time to time. Eventually it was ""solved"" but the strange, sad and lonely tale retained its interest. If you'd like to hear more about that, I recommend checking out channels on YouTube like Scary Mysteries or Barely Sociable.What THIS particular documentary represents is the story around the mystery. It's about the toxic and fannish world of True Crime aficionados, the infighting, the clashes, the betrayals and the often sad lives of the people behind the reddit accounts. Yes, the story of Mostly. Harmless is explored, but it's on the periphery.If you go in knowing what you're getting, that this is as much or more about the amateur forum posters attempting to solve the mystery and give a name to the enigmatic hiker, then you're in for a very fascinating documentary.But if you're already familiar with the case and looking for a break down or, worse, just looking for a proper investigative mystery, then you will probably come away disappointed and feeling a bit cheated."
tt31049718,6.0,"The only thing that I'm really taking away from this documentary is what a loathsome narcissistic P. O. S. Christie is. She doesn't really seem to care at all about the case, she just wants to be the one to solve it. I know exactly what kind of person she is; she gets off on power, on being in charge. Basically, an entitled Karen. The one comment that defined her, made after she shot her mouth off about 'cracking the case', wasn't anything to do with any kind of regret about making a mistake in identifying the hiker, it was about how the mistake would make her look. What an awful human being. Christie, I hope you're reading this. Do better. Be better."
tt9054192,6.0,"This is a fun little movie about some women who sell stolen coupons on the internet.The premise is simple but solid. The film rests squarely on Kirsten and Kirby who are more than up for the task and they were great to watch.This could have been an absolute low-end classic like ""Office Space"" or ""Mad Money"" but it tries a little too hard to make this truly worth your time.The story has a lot of bloat to it that so easily could have been cut. The husband feels like he should be integral to the plot but is superfluous. He is only there to be a one dimensional butt-hole for Kristen to rail against. If anything it makes her character come across unnecessarily cold - ""I don't need you as I have loads of money now so see you later sucker!"".To pad the film out there is some toilet humour and over-acting jokes that just don't land.The relationship between the investigators was a nice touch but it feels like they couldn't decide what to do with the Loss Prevention officer and he sometimes felt like a cartoon character: stupid and irrelevant rather than a loveable buffoon.The plot strays in to silly-land with the hacker character and never really gets back on to solid ground, so any sense of tension was lost and it ended up being a full on comedy and I lost interest in the final outcome.Overall this is bouncy and fun with an adequate production and some funny jokes. It is good for a Sunday afternoon if you want something new but I think it only has one watch in it."
tt9054192,6.0,"This film wasn't deep, and at times it stretched credibility, but it was fun and engaging. I'd call it a buddy film on a couple of levels: The main characters, Connie and Jo, and then the sub-characters, Simon and Ken. The acting was solid, though the relatively unknown Paul Walter Hauser stole the movie. I'd recommend this film for unwinding on a Friday night after a long week."
tt9054192,6.0,"This one turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I had liked the trailer basically the plot but was expecting it to be just ok. But the tight script, good execution and editing makes it worthwhile. Kristen and Kirby get it right in each scene in the movie and Vince Vaughn though with limited screen time does a great job as well."
tt9054192,5.0,"Connie Kaminski (Kristen Bell) and Joanna ""JoJo"" Johnson (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) are best friends at extreme couponing. JoJo is stuck after her identity was stolen and her credit ruined. Connie is struggling after failing to conceive with her IRS husband Rick (Joel McHale). She comes up with the idea to steal coupons leading to a vast scam totally millions. The couponing scam is uncovered by store investigator Ken Miller (Paul Walter Hauser). He is joined by U. S. postal inspector Simon Kilmurry (Vince Vaughn).The first part is a bit quirky and slightly funny. It's fine. I like it. It works until the Lamborghinis. That's too dumb. I don't believe the girls are that dumb. I kept thinking that this is too dumb for these relatively well-spoken and relatively smart people. At that point, the movie turns more towards Dumb and Dumber. The investigation couple is even worst with a particularly infantile poop scene. The movie descends and doesn't get back up."
tt9054192,5.0,"Unfortunately, that good movie wasn't here. There were moments I truly enjoyed and laughed out loud, but they were few and far between. The tone was all over the place in writing, storyline and acting. If they were going for quirky and mixing genres, the writers should have taken a few more notes from something like Raising Arizona."

Since losing her baby she has become an avid coupon-er along with her friend JoJo (Kirby Howell-Baptiste ). They get the idea to obtain coupons from the factory in Mexico using an inside person. Long story short, they get too greedy and make millions that sent up a flag.This was a light comedy that will make you smile, but not laugh. I think what would have made the film good is if Ken (Paul Walter Hauser ) was her donor and used a fake profile.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
tt9054192,6.0,"The best thing about this movie is the actual story, which was INSPIRED by an actual similar event of a young woman collecting coupons by the hundreds, until she realised that IF ONLY she could produce these FREE coupons herself, she would have actual REAL MONENY in her hands with these coupons! And so it goes...The good: this movie has got a sweet, mellow kind of amusing humour, but it unfortunately never really elevates to laugh out loud humor, it stays nice ish, funny ish, but lacking spark and punch.The bad: somehow this comedy never really lifts off, never really sets things on fire. I blame the direction and the timing of the jokes. Several reviewers already mentioned that somewhere there is a good movie burried in there, but it somehow did not come to fruition...Mixed bag. Nice for 1 watch. Not terrible, but definitely not the greatest either."
tt13274016,6.0,"Reptile is a movie that starts out, absolutely fantastic builds to a crescendo about halfway through, and then falls apart through all the red herrings, macguffins, and unresolved loose ends, that it presents in an effort to give us a dramatic end to this murder mystery/procedural drama.Benicio Del Toro delivers possibly the best performance I've ever seen him give he can often seem slimy, slick or creepy but in this film, he comes across just as he intends you to see him, which is as a man with a spotty history as a policeman, but greatly desiring to get onto the street and narrow. He is supported by his dutiful wife Judy, played by Alicia Silverstone in a really strong performance.Justin Timberlake gives us a turn as the bereaved boyfriend of the murder victim, Timberlake and his mother, played by Frances Farmer, who is very underused on the real estate company that Timberlake and his girlfriend work for.Quickly the suspects add up. There is the girlfriends soon to be ex-husband; then there's Eli who Timberlake and farmer have screwed out of his families property. There's also some sort of a weird creepy guy out of the church that's getting painted in the middle of nowhere. This is apparently a piece of property that the girlfriend sold but revisited. This plot point is never revisited, nor dug into any further, yet the paint that they've been using to paint the church appears on the victim and on the victims soon to be ex-husband.Finally, we discover that the whole business is a result of police corruption and drug trafficking and money laundering. The police corruption goes so deep. We are not quite sure who's clean and who's dirty. This also leads to all sorts of loose ends that we are provided.There's a scene with Del Toro at a therapists office as required after a shooting and he talks of a dream. Then later he has a dream or does he? It would seem that the dream which is very plot specific reveals the killer out right and no point do we get any indication that his realization of who the killer is wasn't a real occurrence rather than the dream it is presented as. But so many questions abound.Why would any self-respecting policeman on the teak hang on to the vehicle that was used by the killer to kill the victim?Was the killer actually the police chief and not the boyfriend? We don't know we're never told.Why does Timberlake's character show up just days after the murder of his girlfriend with a girl that looks almost identical to that girlfriend in a restaurant where he runs into the detective leading the case? Further why would he have showed up with this girl and does she have any relevance to the plot that follows? No. It's another blind alley.Is del Toro's partner in on the corruption? At the end we don't know.What was the point of the police pulling Del Toro and his wife over after the party? If only to lead them home? It's possible it was to reinforce the fact that the police corruption goes deeper than he is aware. However, if this is the case it never comes up, or is never revealed at the end of the film. We just don't know what happens.Who actually killed the victim in the film? It is never really divulged who that is. We are led to believe it is the boyfriend, but then if it is, why is the car that was used by the killer parked in the chief of police house?Eli is killed off screen and this time we know Timberlake is in on it but we're not allowed to see who else is present in the room and it is never revealed to us even though it is alluded to.Finally, the climax of the film has some of the most confusing things in it. Del Toro gives the evidence to the police captain, and they both go to see the chief of police to confront him with what they have. Now Del Toro's character has given over the evidence that Eli provided him to the police captain, whom we assume is on the take and Del Toro is unaware. This fact when realized really makes Del Toro seem like a rookie detective and not the seasoned guy he supposed to be.When the chief of police whispers to Del Toro to leave because he's been found out, and that the captain is in on it, before Del Toro can leave, we must assume that the head of the DEA, who is a friend of Del Toro's is responsible for murdering the chief of police in his own home. Hearing this gunshot, Del Toro goes in to the bathroom where the captain has retreated and confront him and kills him. Then Del Toro's friend comes down the stairs after having killed a police, chief and attempt to kill del Toro. They have a gun fight, and Del Toro mortally ones his friend Dave. Then Del Toro picks up his phone and calls 911. We don't see police cars. He doesn't speak to the police or 911 yet in the next scene, we see Timberlake being arrested by the FBI while playing golf and then the next scene cuts to Del Toro Having his wife dip, his hands in hot wax, supposedly/assumedly to remove any gun shot residue he might have on his hands. But why? What is the shooting a good shooting? Or a bad shooting? We'll never know. The Director decides to leave us right there. We don't know if Del Toro is a good cop, who discovered a nest of vipers as the title would lead us to believe or if the FBI stumble across this whole thing on their own, and after their investigation, finally get around to arresting Timberlake. We don't see Francis farmer arrested. We don't see the police force getting arrested for this corruption and drug smuggling and money laundering and murder.So while the film has incredible acting, and has a really neat premise, it just sort of falls apart at the end, because all these questions are left on answered, and there are just too many little bits and pieces that are thrown in that have no reason to be there.."
tt13274016,6.0,"Set in the town of Scarborough, Detective Tom Nichols (Benecio del Toro) and his partner Dan Cleary (Ato Essandoh) investigate the murder of real-estate broker Summer Elswick (Matilda Lutz). As the two run down possible suspects including Summer's boyfriend Will Grady (Justin Timberlake), her ex-husband Sam Gifford (Karl Glusman), and a man with a grudge against the Gradys named Eli Phillips (Michael Pitt), the case goes from a simple murder to something of larger scale implications.Reptile is the feature film debut of music video director Grant Singer who also co-wrote the script alongside Benjamin Brewer and the film's star and executive producer Benicio Del Toro. Singer and Brewer wrote the initial draft of the film in 2018 where it was acquired by Black Label Media who'd previously worked with Del Toro on the Sicario films and upon showing it to him he became a huge proponent of the project. With a gritty noir story, an all star cast, and an Autumn adjacent release date you can tell Netflix wants this to be their equivalent of Gone Baby Gone or Prisoners as that dark horse crime thriller that scores some Oscar nominations, and while it doesn't reach those heights unfortunately it's an ultimately decent detective thriller with a strong sense of style and some committed performances.Despite being the debut feature of Grant Singer, he shows a strong grasp on filmmaking from a stylistic and technical sense with the film given some solid shots that capture the environments in which Nichols investigates. With a predominantly suburban setting that often uses the states of various homes like McMansion Grady is trying to sell having signs of vermin infestation or a neglected swimming pool with stagnant water, you get the sense Singer is trying to capture that underlying sense of rot within these seemingly idyllic homes. While Tom Nichols isn't given the greatest depth as a protagonist, del Toro who serves as a co-writer on the film does add some humanity to the role especially in regards to his relationship with his wife Judy played by Alicia Silverstone who takes what could've been an underwritten character and makes her more of a confidant who actually assists Tom on several occasions and the two have some solid chemistry together. Where the movie faulters for me unfortunately is in the mystery aspect of the film especially in how it establishes its array of suspects only for us to switch gears at the one hour mark where we begin another decidedly different investigation. The writing in the film while fine most of the time is perfectly fine (if not exceptional) but it does lead to some groanworthy dialogue exchanges and a fake-out dream sequence that I didn't really care for.For those who like dramatic procedural thrillers of this kind you will find some good elements to appreciate here especially in how it relates to the acting and visuals on display. The movie itself as a mystery I'm sorry to say fell somewhat flat for me despite seemingly having all the right pieces in play. A slight stumble out the gate for Grant Singer, but one that shows promise if given refinement."
tt13274016,6.0,"As ""Reptile"" (2023 release; 136 min) opens, we meet realtors Will and Summer as they are prepping a house for a showing. Looks like they are a couple. Some time later, Summer is again at that house. Will is on his way there too but for reasons unknown he is not able to reach Summer on her phone. He arrives at the house only to find Summer brutally murdered... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the feature length directing debut of Grant Singer, best known for his music videos. Here he brings a murder mystery that initially seems straight-forward: who killed Summer? Will? Summer's ex? A local bad boy? Except that this is just the beginning. The movie is super plot-heavy so the less said about that, the better. Suffice to say that it helps if you can keep an open mind how it all plays out. Along the way we get a number of great performances including Justin Timberlake (as Will), Benicio del Toro (as the Detective on the case; del Toro also co-wrote the script) and Alicia Silverstone )as the Detective's wife). Yet despite the plot twists, the movie lacks a true element of surprise and it all feels quite standard and strictly by the numbers. Consider as well that this movie was shot a full 2 years ago. Why has it been sitting on the shelves for this long?""Reptile"" premiered at the recent Toronto International Film Festival to ho-hum reactions, and after a limited 1 week theatrical release, the movie started airing on Netflix this weekend. If you are in the mood for a murder mystery, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and reach your own conclusion."
tt13274016,6.0,"This movie has a great cast, very well acted, it sucked me in and held my attention... but then it just ends. It was almost like they looked at the clock and realized that they had to finish, so they tried to tie it up as neat as possible. Maybe I have been spoiled by the twists and turns of other thrillers, maybe I have been spoiled by slow-burn films that have huge endings.This was a slow-burn, with no big flame, and it was immediately extinguished. I honestly feel like they could have condensed everything thing that happens, because the ending feels like the halfway point. Just as things start moving, it stops. Great actors though, I really enjoyed the movie until I realized they were going to rush job the ending.They never even explain what happened to his hand in the beginning of the film. He does injure it again at the end, and then they have the silly wax dip so the can tie in this forced notion of a reptile shedding its skin. Meh."
tt13274016,5.0,"I have no idea why this movie is called reptile,maybe it's because most reptiles are cold blooded like most characters in this movie.My god is this movie slowwwww, it felt like it went on forever, plenty of close face shots, and Birdseye view of cars driving down country roads, the background music was more dramatic than the actual movie. The story is ok, and the twists are ok, nothing you haven't seen before.The movie is blessed with a strong star cast, benicio del Toro, a personal favourite holds the movie together, supported by Alicia Silverstone and Justin Timberlake who has aged super bad...lol.I wanted to give this movie a better rating, the star cast deserved better but the movie moves at a pace that is soooo slow, who needs a general anesthetic when you can watch this."
tt14030816,5.0,"Shame. I really wanted to enjoy it more.Intriguing premise. A creature that can bring the dead for 2 minutes! And only 2 or it will take control (But doesn't that sound familiar? Talk to Me, anyone?)Freya Allan (The Witcher) did her best as did the supporting cast, featuring the likes of Peter Mullan (Tyrannosaur) and Saffron Burrows (Deep Blue Sea).Unfortunately the film lacked any real tension or suspense and despite its surprisingly short length, it felt like a real slog. Relieved by a few jump scares.I just wish more time was spent on the origin of the creature and character depth to actually feel anything.It just seemed to go through the motions with the same ol' predictable hokum and some bizarre 2000s visual effects from The Mummy films.A shame. It killed the time but it won't be haunting my memories for long."
tt14030816,6.0,"Ok maybe i'm way off on this one. But i went into this movie blind and knowing absolutely nothing about it, and came out liking it more than the people who took me to see it and were looking forward to it.I mean its not a perfect movie, and it did have a couple of lame familiar moments. But overall it tried it hardest to be different and avoid the same old thing we've seen time and again. It had a decent plot with a couple of twists, and good acting. But is a mild horror really. So won't keep all fans of the genre happy.Its a strange one as there's nothing terribly old but nothing amazingly new in the movie. But i'd say its worth a one of watch. Even if my friends would say it isn't."

She decides to spend a night - along with some VHS instructions - in the place to think on things and encounters the enigmatic young ""Neil"" (Jeremy Irvine) who offers her £4,000 so he can talk to his wife in the cellar! She tells him to come back next day, asks her lawyer pal ""Katie"" (Ruby Barker) to come and stay and before too long reckons she could be on to a cunning money-making wheeze. He comes back and to the cellar the three head. Two chairs and a great big hole in the wall greet them, followed by some filthy and scrawny fingers as the eponymous woman emerges from the darkness and... Yikes! Rather than being scared witless, ""Iris"" does a wee bit of research and concludes that she can control this scenario and make loads of cash too. ""Katie"" isn't so easily convinced and the lovelorn ""Neil"" is clearly working on a solution that will work more permanently for him! There are some startlingly stupid decisions made by the characters in this film, and some of the (sparing) visual effects are the stuff of the ""Exorcist"" from fifty years ago, but as a low-budget enterprise it is no worse than your standard Blumhouse fayre that trot in and out of our cinemas every few weeks. The acting is all adequate, as is the writing and the story has it's moment of intrigue as it develops. Though I'll never remember watching it in a fortnight, I quite enjoyed it for the ninety minutes leading to a denouement that I did rather like."
tt14030816,6.0,"""Baghead"" is a film whose trailer looks promising, however the film is quite simple and barely saves itself from being bad. The cast gives decent performances, the cinematography is well done without being outstanding, the digital special effects, which are few, are poorly done and the director's work manages to have merit by bringing to the screen a couple of effective suspense scenes, but then everything falls apart. It becomes boring, it loses suspense and the horror has no effect. For its part, the soundtrack, editing work and sound design go completely unnoticed. The script had potential and was not used, ""Baghead"" is a pretty weak film."
tt14030816,5.0,"I went into this movie with very low expectations, and I was fairly impressed with what I watched. This movie is your typical modern day horror, which will rely on 17 jump scares and loud music to really have you trembling. But this was something I expected. The premise of the movie however was interesting. Given any real thought and the movie falls apart fairly quickly, but if you just buckle in for the ride it's fun. I was also impressed by the ending. I again was expecting an ending which fit the formula of an insidious movie, but thankfully we got something different that was memorable. Conclusion: while it did nothing remarkable or separated itself from modern spirit horror movies, I will say I found it more engaging and entertaining than the insidious franchise. It's mediocre, and that's okay."
tt14030816,5.0,"Just Got Out of a Baghead Screening.There's way too Many Problems with This Film.Key:
🏁 - That's Fine
🚩 - Doesn't Work
🤷 - Sort Of Possible🏁 Ok so the Central Theme is Different Visitors can Go Down into the Basement and Summon Dead Relatives/Friends/Wives etc For 2 Minutes and anything over 2 Minutes, Baghead Takes over and Slowly Get more Powerful. So Baghead with each encounter is filling up a Meter until she Hits that Requirement to then Escape the Basement. This is Good.🚩 The ""Don't Cross this Line"" Rule. So the Previous Owner never had that ""Don't Cross this line"" rule right? So how comes Baghead didn't just get up and Go during the Previous Owners Run of Ownership? I get that she has to obey, but she sometimes does what she wants, so that's not consistent. Was She not Powerful enough yet? But the Descendants broke her out and Were Using her Power For Quite Some time. Surely, she had enough Power by the Time Iris' Ownership came around or even during her dads overseeing.🚩 Iris appearing as a Ghost whilst she watches Previous Baghead Encounters, where did that rule come from? Can each Owner now have the Superpower to Appear and watch any previous Baghead Encounters?🏁 So Baghead was Pulling all of the Strings all Along? She certainly Coerced Iris(Sound cues of whispers to iris).But what about everyone else?1. 🤷 She could of Possibly Pulled the String of Neil, he knew what was down there, and so through Whispers, dreams etc(off screen), she could of possibly pulled his string to keep visiting there.2. 🚩 What about Katie? Did Baghead Pull this string too? Did she get Katie to Go and See The Solicitors Premises? But why? So Baghead could get some material of hundreds of years ago through Katie, so that Baghead could summon the Hundreds of years ago Guy and deliver all of this dialogue about what Baghead is? That makes no sense, and then Baghead takes back control and then offs her? What was the Point of that? (😬 Super Effective Scare By Him during the Katie and Him scene Though, that one hit me and I saw movements in my peripherals in the rows below, the Sound Design coupling that Visual was Super Strong)3. 🤷 What about Owen?(iris' Father) Did she pull that String to get him to Accidentally Kill himself so that Iris would then Take Ownership of The Building?4. And what was the Point of Certain Things in that Ending? Did Baghead need Iris' Body in Particular just so she can Escape? Did Baghead fill up the Meter of her Power Level now and it was Time to Escape and Iris was the Unlucky Owner at that time? Both of these are Anywhere from 🤷to🚩There's Just too Many damn Things that either don't work or are too far fetched because the film didn't execute many things Effectively Enough.There are Some Positives -1. 🎶 The Sound Design, the sound design of this film was Very effective, the creepy sounds pinging across the auditorium definitely elevated this experience of the Watch. There was one particular Segment, which had the sound of something Crawling up the to my left side of the Auditorium. Great Sound Design.2. 🎥 They nailed the Tone, Production Design and Cinematography. It was all Very fitting for this Particular Film.3. 👱 The Lead Girl Freya Allans Performance was Solid, she had this Backstory of pretty much Being a derelict, Which Lends well to the Sorrow Tone of this Film.4. 🙋🙋The Other Performances. 1. Her Friend - Ruby Barker, which was Fine, she did well enough, and the Main Young Guy Jeremy Irvine, he did Better, his performance added some energy to the Film.5. 📜 Again, the Concept was Good, and there were bits and pieces of the Plotline that were Interesting. For instance, the Origin of Baghead., and that Baghead will Only Obey the Owner of the Premises (until she decides not too anymore).😦 Neutral Note - the Ending, it Certainly had Shock Factor, I wasn't expecting them to go there. BUT, because of everything leading up to that and after that moment, it just felt like ""Well, that was Shocking, but it still doesn't make the Film Good""Overall, Great Concept but then they wrote themselves into far too many unnecessary Complications, some of which are just Outright Farfetched."
tt14030816,6.0,"Baghead sees Freya Allan inherit a dilapidated old bar from her estranged father (Peter Mullan) thus becoming the unwitting guardian of an undead witch holed up in basement. Not an ideal scenario but the fact the witch can temporarily bring people back to life (if only for two minutes) and people are prepared to pay good money for a final farewell to their loved ones, posses a conundrum for Allan's broke and homeless character.Its fairly obvious the Baghead is one of those horror movies adapted from a breakout short (this seems to be the de facto way to get a horror movie made these days) and as such it has a provenly solid concept but faces the challenge of stretching this out to an hour and a half. It succeeds in some ways better than others.Filling in the plot has proven to be a struggle, with the writers never getting much further than the set up. Everything from there on relies on contrivance and stupid character decisions to drive things forward. There is an attempt to explain the witch's powers but it is pretty half-hearted and is really only there to pad the runtime. Similarly, a ""reveal"" near the end that aims to shed light on some of the dumb actions of the characters doesn't really change anything and feels pointless.The film is much more successful in the, probably more important, area of dishing out the scares. It's pretty atmospheric and while it pulls from the standard bag of horror tricks (cracking bones, lights out, things scuttling on ceilings, etc) it manages some unsettling moments as well as jump scares. The small cast do a good job of selling it all even as they are forced to act in some unnatural ways to make the spook happen (why not just set the timer for ten seconds earlier rather than wait til the witch is messing with you every time). Mullan in particular is typically excellent and adds gravitas to proceedings even if he is mainly glimpsed through flashbacks.With the theme of talking to the dead its easy to draw unfaltering comparisons with the superior Talk to Me of last year but, given the short came out in 2017, Baghead is no knock off and deserves to be treated as it's own thing. That thing being a completely serviceable yet unremarkable little pocket of horror.6 crispy mysterious father figures out of 10."
tt14030816,5.0,"This had bags of potential (no pun intended) but it just wasn't used. The script and idea is good but there is just not enough scare points scored with this. It is eerie in parts and the heartful backnotes of seeing your loved ones again after death makes this movie watchable but it is just not enough to rate over a 5 out of 10 score. Howecer I don't think you can blame this entirely on the director or the writers, this needed a bigger budget and really with that cash injection this would have been a great watch on par with the conjurning movies. Just fell short unfortunatley, which is a shame."

I nearly did not go to see this because of terrible reviews (17% on IMDB). Glad I did because it looks great, the cast are good and Ned Denehy plays a creepy lawyer as only he can. If you do not recognise the name I promise you will remember his face because he is creepy as hell. It is a decent horror but suffers in comparison to 'Talk to me' as the premise is similar. It is based on a short from 2017 so is not a rip off. This is the only explanation I can think of for all the hate from film journalists.It is a definite R rated horror with the courage of it's convictions and worth a watch if you are a horror fan."

OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood.So, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it's average, it's my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I'm a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn't take their ""love"" seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward's father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you're a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matinée price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.5/10"

tt0092099,6.0,"I watched Top Gun because I thought it would be a good idea to prepare myself for the sequel. It turned out Top Gun was simply okay. It was film with some memorable lines like ""Your mouth is writing checks your ass can't cash"" and ""I got the need, the need for speed"" and it had a recoginisble soundtrack. It was the film that showed Tom Cruise had some action credentials, gave Val Kilmer an early role and was Tony Scott's first big success as a feature film director. It was a macho film for people who are interested in the military and military tech - although some people have said it has a homo-erotic subtext.The issue with Top Gun is the story is thin. It was simply about characters training at an elite flight school. The character work was decent enough, Maverick and Goose's friendship was believable and whilst Iceman was made out to be an antagionist, he did rise some valid points.I didn't find the air combat that interesting. It was just footage of planes flying and close-ups in the cockpit. It's a real shame because Tony Scott did become a dependable action director later in his career."
tt0092099,6.0,"Back when I worked in the aviation industry 'Top Gun' was always a big deal. Pilots couldn't believe I hadn't seen it. A lot of them even said it was the reason they pursued that career path. I even have a close friend who has it as their favourite movie. And yet it still didn't really interest me. In fact if there wasn't a sequel coming out for it soon I may never have gotten around to watching it. It always seemed to me, from the little I knew about it, that it was a plotless movie. And having seen it that was a correct assessment. The movie isn't really about anything. The only thing that saves it from being a complete dumpster fire is the charisma of the characters.It's funny to watch a movie so old that the line 'I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you"" is still included and even gets a laugh from the other characters. The film hasn't really aged that well in a lot of ways. The way the action sequences are filmed can make them quite hard to watch. This is something I hope they do far better in the sequel. I certainly enjoyed the characters interacting on land far more than the often quite lengthy action sequences in the air.The film has some memorable quotes which have aged very well. It also has a very good cast who do an excellent job of lifting the film up and making it what it is. It's not a film I can recommend as a must-watch though unfortunately. There simply isn't enough to it for me to do that."
tt0092099,6.0,"I'd never seen this one but decided to give it a go given all the hype for the newly-released sequel. It's what you'd expect from Tony Scott, a hymn to the 1980s full of flashiness and style and good-looking actors barking killer lines. A great cast makes it more than watchable and the direction's pretty slick too. Best of all is the excellent soundtrack."
tt0092099,5.0,"I only watched this movie because I wanted to watch it before watching Top Gun Maverick. The plot was okay, but there's nothing really interesting happening; it's just about a guy trying to prove he's the best fighter pilot and he falls in love with some random girl. There's no uniqueness to it compared to other love story movies, except there's some fighter planes in it. I'm not really a fan of fighter planes, but I did like the visuals of them and the fight scenes. We don't know who the enemy was they were fighting against which was probably done to prevent controversy, but it would've been nice knowing who they were fighting."

There are no women of his species around to fulfill his needs so he's settling for the next best thing.After Creature From The Black Lagoon was found in the Everglades and came to a sad end, another expedition finds a Gill Man in the Amazon head water country. This of course is a scientific expedition, but they have expenses and someone gets the bright idea that an exhibit at an aquarium will make the creature pay for itself.Carl Denham when he was exhibiting King Kong had the same idea and we know how that turned out. A lot of the plot elements of King Kong are present in Revenge Of The Creature. The Gill Man fixes on scientist Lori Nelson to the distress of both John Agar and John Bromfield. I guess there are no blonds in the Everglades or the Amazon.Look quickly and don't blink and you'll spot Clint Eastwood in a small role. The whole film is on the silly side, but definitely a lot of fun."
tt0048554,6.0,"Yep, the gill-man from ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" is back! This time, they capture him and put him in a Florida aquarium. But sure enough, the poor sucker has the hots for a beautiful young woman.""Revenge of the Creature"" is simply a fun movie to watch. Admittedly, a lot of it is VERY dated, but we can understand that. To be certain, a specific shot of Lori Nelson must have given millions of boys their first carnal experience. Of course, one of the most significant things about this movie is the appearance of Clint Eastwood in his debut: he plays the lab technician who can't find his mouse. Dirty Harry isn't feeling so lucky in that scene after all! Anyway, it's the sort of movie that you just watch to enjoy. They must have had fun making it. Also starring John Agar (Shirley Temple's first husband).Like I said: millions of boys must have LOVED that one shot of Lori Nelson!"
tt0048554,5.0,"""Revenge Of The Creature"" is at best a sequel that pales in comparison to the original, and pretty well done, ""Creature From The Black Lagoon."" A lot of what made the original movie work is missing here. The performances aren't as good, Lori Nelson (while attractive) isn't as head turning beautiful as Julie Adams was in the original, and, being set mostly (except for the first few minutes) in Florida rather than the Amazon, the sequel lacks some of the mystery of the original.In ""Revenge,"" the gill-man is captured by scientists and brought to some sort of public aquarium to be studied and to serve as a big attraction for the tourists. Admittedly, one thing this movie had that I didn't find in the original was a bit of sympathy for the creature. You can't help but feel a bit sorry for him chained in the tank and jolted with cattle prods on a regular basis as the tourists gawk at him. The creature is much more the focus of this movie, and the violence he commits is shown much more graphically (although all within the acceptable tastes of 1955, of course.) Where the creature isn't the focus, the movie weakens dramatically. The romance between Clete and Helen was a sort of ""ho-hum, who really cares"" experience, and why in the world we needed to be introduced to so many cutesy animals doing tricks (the porpoise, the chimpanzee) was beyond me. One thing I couldn't figure out was - even given his obsession with her - how the creature kept managing to find Helen in a variety of places.Admittedly, the creature is a fun monster to watch; the movie unfortunately is less so. 5/10"
tt0048554,5.0,"Back in the Upper Amazon River Valley, an expedition headed by Professor Clete Ferguson (John Agar) attempts to locate the missing link first introduced in the previous year's ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"". With only Nestor Paiva as Captain Lucas on hand from the original cast, the beast is quickly located and subdued via a series of explosive charges set about his watery domain. Upon arrival at his new home in Marineland Park, the Creature is shackled in a holding tank where scientists can study his behavior and determine that he ""just misses being human"".Lori Nelson portrays college student and budding scientist Helen Dobson, object of the affections of both Professor Ferguson and the Creature. Throughout the film, no matter where Helen and the professor happen to be, the Gill-Man without the help of mapquest, is able to pinpoint their exact location - it's uncanny. And that's saying something, as sightings of the escaped monster were reported in the film as far ranging as Norfolk, Virginia to Panama - this guy did get around!The strength of the Creature is established in the film, where viewers could only guess at before. On his escape into the ocean from the Marineland tank, he easily overturns a car that stands in his path. Later on he throws a hapless victim halfway across the beach into some palm trees with ease. Contrast this effort with the underwater grappling scenes with the scientists in this and the prior film, where the opponents managed to get away relatively unharmed. It all suggests that the Creature's abilities were manufactured on the fly without much thought given to it's potential or limitations.For all of the film's inconsistencies though, it's still campy fun and as enjoyable as any of the schlock follow ups to the more serious Universal originals, such as the Mummy sequels. And lest I forget, probably the best unexpected treat of the movie - Clint Eastwood in his screen debut for just a brief moment, trying to figure out what happened to a missing lab mouse!"
tt0048554,6.0,"REVENGE OF THE CREATURE is the follow-up to THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, one of the most iconic Universal horrors of all time. This one's a far lesser film, suffering from weak scripting which feels like the whole story is merely a lower-budgeted riff on KING KONG. Our favourite Gill Man is minding his own business in his lagoon when a bunch of scientists kidnap him and take him back to America. There he's probed and experimented upon until he finally busts loose and goes on a mini rampage. I found the Creature himself a sympathetic creation this time around, and his romance with the statuesque Lori Nelson good fun. The human characters are pretty bland, although it's fun to see Clint Eastwood in his film debut and the staging's slick and to the point."
tt0048554,6.0,"After the success of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"", Universal Studios figured audiences would want to take another dip with the Gill Man and they were right. This time, marine biologist Bromfield hires the same boat captain that took the first set of scientists to the lagoon and sets out to capture the creature. After bombing the place (and killing all the fish....apparently ecology was but a thing of the future!), he captures the comatose creature and ships him to Florida to be an attraction and an experiment at an aqua park. He is joined by researcher Agar and student Nelson (looking and sounding far more mature than her 22 years!) who attempt to train the creature to respond to human commands. When the Gill Man has had enough of being chained to the floor of a huge aquarium and being prodded and tormented by his captors, he breaks loose, nabs Nelson and leads the police on a massive chase along the Florida coastline. This second entry (with one more sequel to come) doesn't have the same creepy atmosphere of the original, but it more than makes up for it in campy, unintentionally humorous ways. Agar gives a very routine performance, smiling idiotically at various points, then reverting to stoicism. Nelson runs hot and cold, too. In her first scene, when she witnesses a man being attacked by the creature, her expression is along the same lines as discovering that her soufflé fell while she was gabbing on the phone. She improves as it goes along, but is given some goofy things to say and do. She is hardly a match for the divine Julie Adams in the original, though her dress at the end is lovely and she gets to do what had to be a partial inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's shower scene in ""Psycho"". Bromfield, not long after having frolicked with Esther Williams in ""Easy to Love"", has a more difficult swimming partner this time as he continuously wrangles the Gill Man. His tan, beefy looks fill out his teeny swim trunks beautifully, though his role eventually becomes a bit of a throwaway. (Fortunately, the baggy shorts the men wore in the first movie have been replaced by dinky, tight speedo-like ones here.) Future stars Eastwood and Halsey appear in bit parts. Eastwood has the most lamentable role as a sort of backward lab technician who can't keep track of the four mice he's been placed in charge of. Halsey has it better as a college student who has a run-in with the creature. The film is chock full of dry, now-hilarious moments of drama and bizarre plot details that make little or no sense. Nelson befriends a dog that roams into the aqua park and then has it living in her hotel room? The creature can track Nelson on land from the ocean? A police dispatcher feels it necessary to announce that she's a ""pretty"" student when detailing her kidnapping. When the monster goes on his rampage, a woman blithely lets go of her daughter who then falls at the feet of the creature. Miraculously, though he has mauled and killed men beforehand, he lets the mother kneel down and protect the child. In this film, more than in the original, audience sympathy leans towards the creature. After all, he was dragged form his home and then placed on display. The ""training"" sequences are remarkably cruel. Nelson places a box of food near him and as he reaches for it, Agar stabs him with a bull prod! Nice! Then she does the same thing with a ball. She entices him to play with it and then here comes the prod again! (Incidentally, the whole prod issue seems unlikely to work the way it is shown.) It does, however, turn a bit funny when the Gill Man retreats and sits on a rusty anchor. As in the original, there's an underwater swimming sequence, this time with Agar and Nelson canoodling while the creature lurks. Gill Man could have easily snatched her and gone off, but then there'd be no film. Even amongst all the goofiness, a modicum of suspense makes its way into the movie. Again, the monster gets some surprising mobility and speed underwater and is pretty threatening. This film draws from past classics (""King Kong""), yet inspired future movies as well (""Jaws 3-D"", ""Orca"".) Far from a true classic, it entertains in spite of itself."
tt0048554,6.0,"Creature from the Black Lagoon isn't a perfect film but it is a lot of fun and one of the better monster movies of the 50s. Revenge of the Creature misses the mark in comparison, but there are definitely worse sequels out there, it is better than its reputation and while The Creature Walks Among Us(the other sequel) needs to be re-watched I do remember Revenge being better than that. The story is not as good or as suspenseful this time round, it takes too long to set up, while the romance is very half-baked and the monster is used a little too much which dissipates the impact. The dialogue wasn't a strong point in the original, but it still wasn't anyway near as corny and awkward as the dialogue here. John Ager also gives a very wooden lead performance. It is however well photographed- as with the original the underwater sequences do look wonderful- and solidly directed with extravagant locations, and the monster still looks good(one of the better man-in-a-monster-suit monsters of any 50s monster movie) and manages to be menacing and sympathetic even in surroundings that are not quite as effective this time around. The score succeeds in exuding haunting atmosphere and jaunty energy, and there are some good set pieces with the monster, especially with the overturned car and aquarium. Also the shower motel sequence with it watching, not quite as scary as it lurking beneath the sea watching Julie Adams swimming on her own in the original, but it's the closest it gets to anything as effective as that. Like Creature from the Black Lagoon the characters are not particularly well-developed, the leads in fact are very underdeveloped, but they don't annoy either. Lori Nelson does acquit herself quite well, filling in big shoes and doing so quite admirably, while Clint Eastwood in his first screen role makes a brief but interesting appearance. Overall, has a lot wrong with it but not a bad sequel. 5.5/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0048554,5.0,"Well, I've seen worse, lots worse. In its favor, the movie still features one of the coolest (and best implemented) monster designs ever to emerge from the old B&W films of that era, and the underwater photography is still quite arresting - apparently the actor in the creature costume was capable of holding his breath underwater for incredible amounts of time, and so the creature looks entirely at home and natural in the water. Against it? A weak screen play where nothing interesting happens for almost 30 minutes in two different parts of the movie. Some of the worst movie dialog actors have ever been forced to utter (I can just imagine how John ""I worked with John Wayne once"" Agar must have died inside while trying to deliver some of his bon-mots.) A distinct lack of chemistry between Agar and Lori Nelson and a screen play that does nothing to give them anything to draw them together (except for the old ""you are so ""the only person around"" problem). Worse, the creature himself seems over-exposed here. Since the movie yanks him out of his creepy, isolated, backwater lagoon in the first 15 minutes, he loses the mystery and most of his menace from his original surroundings once he is moved to his bright, shiny Sea World. After that, he's just a good costume and a set of talons. The guy who wrote ""Keep Watching The Skies"" remarked about ""Revenge Of the Creature"" that the only good things about this sequel are the elements they kept from the first one. I'd have to agree that this is about right - everything the film makers tried to add and expand on in the sequel just didn't really click. Still, as a little kid, this would have been great fun."
tt0048554,5.0,"If you've seen the original, this one is a little tough to sit through. The acting is up to its abyssal par and Lori Nelson is attractive but the thing takes place in Marineland, Florida. Far from being exotic, as ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"" was, we have a tourist trap within a state that is itself one big tourist trap. The harmless dialog sometimes sound aimed at a demographic exemplified more by the Gill Man than by his human captors. Reporter to Lori Nelson: ""Can you tell us why you're here?"" Nelson: ""I'm an ichthyologist."" Reporter: ""An ichthyologist! Wow! That's a ten-dollar word. Can you tell us what it means?"" Nelson: ""I study fish."" There's little mystery to it. It opens with the same boat and the same skipper taking a trip up the same ""tributary of the Amazon River"" but that sequence is over with in a jiffy when the gill man is comatized by some dynamite and transported forthwith to his tank in the states. This is rather like the second half of ""King Kong"". The creature gets loose, offs a few people, and returns to the sea, only to be drawn back to land by his fascination with Lori Nelson. Well, we can't blame the creature. I saw this as a kid and was astonished when Lori Nelson dropped her bathrobe and slithered around in her skivvies preparatory to taking a shower. It didn't matter than her underwear looked like G.I. issue.This is some Gill Man, by the way. He's escaped and is now in the ocean, right? But he swims up the St. Johns River and knows that Lori Nelson has gotten on a boat with John Agar. As the boat travels upriver, the Gill Man follows it. When Agar and Nelson stop at a motel, the Gill Man even knows which room to go to. And later, he even knows that Nelson is DANCING with Agar at a nightclub called The Lobster Pot, from which he kidnaps her. You ought to see the atmosphere people at that Lobster Pot dance. They were locals, hired from an establishment next to the restaurant, and not one of them is smiling or having a good time, just stiffly shuffling about to Henry Mancini's music. I did a far better job as an extra, dancing at an embassy party in ""Windmills of the Gods,"" a cheap miniseries that puts this so-called ""feature film"" to shame. ""Windmills of the Gods"" is a splendid example of what a film SHOULD look like. The acting of the extras, in particular, is eyeball-coagulatingly good. And if you want to see truly exuberant dancing extras, watch my bro and his wife on the dance floor in ""Timepiece.""I got lost for a moment. Where was I? Did I get through Lori Nelson's skivvies? Yes, I see I did. Okay -- I also wanted to mention that the scenes of the creature being subject to Pavolovian conditioning underwater is impossible. Electricity is nothing more than a bunch of loose electrons jumping from atom to atom and they're especially attracted to water, so you can not shock a monster under water.I should mention the film's good points too, I suppose, in pursuit of a balanced assessment so the reader can make an independent judgment. Let's see. I pointed out Lori Nelson's undies, didn't I. Well then there is the scene of two teen-aged boys driving in a convertible and arguing about whether college is worth the effort or not. The driver argues that high school is good enough for him. The other points out that nowadays a college education is getting to be what a high school education used to be. He may think he's being wise but I happen to have more degrees than a thermometer and I'm sorry I didn't quit high school and go into the cement business. I'd be living like a Pasha today instead of in this hovel.In sum: Not really a bad movie, and entertaining in its own unchallenging way. It also includes a few shots of Lori Nelson in her underwear. I may have pointed that out elsewhere. What it lacks, it lacks mostly in comparison to its predecessor which was a neatly tied-up story suggestive of the bizarre as well as the exotic."
tt0048554,5.0,"The first sequel to 1954's low-budget hit ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" looks even more cut-rate than its predecessor, despite that film's financial success. An exploration team in the Upper Amazon manages to capture the Creature quite easily (by setting off explosives in the lagoon which render the Gill-man incapacitated). A scientist hears the news and puts himself in charge once the Gill-man is shipped to an aquatic park in Florida, where he performs tests on the Creature with the hope (one presumes) he can be taught to obey tasks like a trained porpoise. Naturally, the Gill-man doesn't like being prodded with an electric pole or swiping at a ball on a chain--however, a pretty blonde science student has caught his eye (when a local newscaster tries inducing public panic after the Gill-man escapes, we know that all he really wants is the woman). While the first Creature feature wasn't exactly clever or witty, it had terrific 'jungle' ambiance and shimmering black-and-white photography. With the exception of a swimming duet between John Agar and Lori Nelson, the underwater visuals here are muddy or fuzzy (mainly due to overtures to the 3-D process). Nelson has her pick between strapping explorer John Bromfield (who could be Richard Egan's twin brother) and lab professor John Agar (who looks so out-of-shape, his clothes hang off him). Most viewers will end up rooting for the Gill-man who, in one instance, protects his lady-love by flinging a college student against a tree (a special effects scene I thought was well-done, but one many fans feel belies the film's low-end production cost). Clint Eastwood makes his debut as a lab tech (you hear his unmistakable voice before you see his face), and there are some good location scenes shot at Marineland, but the script fails to come up with one good idea after the Creature escapes. Followed in 1956 by the final chapter, ""The Creature Walks Among Us"". ** from ****"
tt0048554,6.0,"The Creature was the last of the classic Universal monsters I got into, which only happened in 2001 via the original DVD release of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (1954). I loved the film immediately, however, and was very much interested in watching its two sequels - REVENGE OF THE CREATURE and THE CREATURE WALKS AMONG US (1956).Now that I've caught up with both of them, I'd say that Universal did well enough by this particular monster, and that having arrived so long after the Studio's other notables (Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Invisible Man and The Wolf Man) proved fortuitous, because The Creature wasn't allowed to become redundant in his own 'starring vehicles' as was the case certainly - and sadly - with both The Frankenstein Monster and The Mummy.As for the film itself, it isn't up to the original (with which I should be re-acquainting myself over the week-end) - despite having the same director. The change in setting is interesting, and it works most of the time; the main problem, I guess, lies with The Creature's alarmingly limited characteristics: it can only either swim (in the water) or go on a rampage (on land) - although, to be fair, The Mummy is perhaps even duller! Still, the film offers reasonable entertainment and the leads are O.K. if, again, failing to match those of the original."
tt0790724,5.0,"'One Shot' is my favourite book. Not my favourite Jack Reacher book. My favourite book. So when I heard they were not only going to be making a Reacher film, but making 'One Shot', I was ecstatic. Then I heard who would be playing Reacher and like 99.9% of fans I thought to myself, ""this must be an April Fool's joke. A 5'7"" skinny guy playing the hulking 250 pound, 6'5"" Jack Reacher? This can't be happening."" Sadly it was. And then the trailer came out and my worst fears were confirmed. Cruise was not being buffed up by any type of body suit, he wasn't being made to look taller with trick photography and he wasn't putting on the raspy 'animal-like' voice I always imagined Reacher to have.Lee Child once made a great analogy to Jack Reacher. He said ""does anyone remember the story lines in the Dirty Harry Movies? Not a chance. But they sure as hell remember the character."" The Reacher books are about a single thing, and that is Jack Reacher. Don't get me the wrong, the stories in 90% of the books released so far are masterpieces and could easily be made into great films. But they still remain a vehicle for which Jack Reacher can thrive in. And the producers proved that they realised this (albeit very late in the piece) by renaming the movie 'Jack Reacher'. A little in-your-face for my liking, but I could see why it was necessary so I didn't hold it against them. However I did reserve my right to hold Tom Cruise's casting against them. And I was right to. Did Tom Cruise pull off the great character of Jack Reacher? Not in your life.Cruise was cast badly, and then went on to play the role even worse. Not a great combination if you're an actor. Heath Ledger took the opposite route in his role as The Joker in Christopher Nolan's 2008 masterpiece ""The Dark Knight"". He was hugely criticised for being completely wrong for the part when he was cast and we all know how that turned out. Cruise unfortunately did not rise to the challenge in the same way.For starters, I'm reasonably confident he was the shortest person in the film. Not one effort was made to make him look the least bit impressive stature wise. His haircut was ridiculous. He looked like a guy who goes to the hair salon twice a week for touch-ups. In fact Jai Courtney in the role of the Charlie had what I always imagined to be the perfect haircut for Reacher. Perhaps he would've been better placed in the role? Cruise's shoulders were not broad enough. At one stage a character asks ""I'm looking for a guy who could kill a man with one punch?"" To which he is directed straight to Reacher. Get real. Rosamund Pike was probably more likely to kill someone that way than Cruise. Cruise did not alter his voice one bit for the movie. This was a huge disappointment for me. I had really hoped he would do something like what Christian Bale did when he was in the Batman suit, only not quite to the same degree, but for the whole movie. Cruise sounded almost feminine performing some of the lines. Lastly, he kept bloody smiling (or smirking, whatever you want to call it). I was OK with him cracking the odd joke here and there, because Reacher can be a bit of a smart-ass, but he didn't have to look so damn proud of himself every time he did it. Reacher's an animal, 24-7, he (very) rarely smiles and he takes life very seriously.The script was solid, it stayed pretty faithful to the book. I found the jokes and one-liners a little too frequent for my liking and took away from what should have been a dark atmosphere. Unfortunately, Reacher was never really challenged physically. Sure, everyone he fought was bigger than him, but that's only because Cruise is so short. Never once did I think to myself 'how's Reacher possibly going to take down this guy?"" Which always makes for the best fight scenes. One part of the script I did not like at all, again regarding the 'bad guys', was when two of them, whilst trying to attack Reacher, were practically fighting each other even harder. And just because they wanted to get through the door first? I felt like I was watching 'Home Alone' or something. I assume they were going for comedic value but it just went far too far for my liking.The rest of the cast were solid at best, in fact I found Rosamund Pike well below average in her performance, but I wasn't too bothered by this because they were the epitome of a support cast. They weren't who people came to see. People came to see Cruise and he let them down. The interesting thing is that the movie isn't being panned across the board, which is testament to how good the story is. It's a great story and could easily have been done without Reacher, which is basically what has happened for people who haven't read the books. They don't have those to compare the character to and so they leave the theater quite happily. And that's great for them. But for the rest of us they have ruined a great character. I hope when I read future books I can still picture the character the same way I always have. Sadly, I fear I may struggle."

Out of the blue, Jack appears in the city and Helen invites him to work for her investigating the case. Soon he finds that the Barr is innocent and there is a conspiracy behind the murders where the apparent culprit is the scapegoat.""Jack Reacher"" is an action movie better than I expected. The plot is intriguing but as usual the ego of Tom Cruise spoils the movie. There are unbearable scenes but maybe the worst scenes are Jack Reader going unarmed to face the gang of killers in the stone quarry and when he drops his weapon to fight against Charlie while Helen is prisoner of the bad guys. Then he easily executes The Zec in a lack of consistency in his behavior. Last but not the least: Why not Gerard Butler in the lead role? My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Jack Reacher: O Último Tiro"" (""Jack Reacher: The Last Shot"")"
tt0790724,5.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. Lee Child has written 17 Jack Reacher books since 1997, and it's a bit surprising that it took Hollywood this long to latch on to this enigmatic lone wolf drifter who doesn't so much care about laws as he does right and wrong. Fans of the books were outraged when it was announced Tom Cruise would play the 6'5 hulking Reacher, as much of the character's appeal stems from his ability to physically dominate a situation while using very few words.Unfortunately I can't ease the minds of those fans of the pulpy series, but rather to encourage them to give this a shot. Author Child was probably ecstatic when Mr. Cruise took an interest in the character, despite the obvious conflicts. Very few actors can command screen presence like Cruise, especially in action sequences. That's where this gets a bit dicey. This is not an action movie. It's an investigative mystery thriller that includes 3-4 action sequences.The film has a real 1970's feel to it along the lines of Billy Jack or Walking Tall mixed with Dirty Harry or numerous westerns with strong, silent types. See, Reacher is a former military investigator with a mind that is always a step or two ahead of everyone else. He looks at the obvious evidence and immediately notes a list of doubts where none previously existed.A seemingly random sniper attack is a bold way to begin a movie given recent real-life events, but the opening sequence is executed with methodical precision and daring so that we can quickly believe in Reacher's conspiracy theories. In the blink of an eye, Reacher has appeared out of nowhere (his usual address) and is in the middle of the investigation being conducted by the lawyer of the wrongly accused James Barr (Joseph Sikora). The defense lawyer is played by Rosamund Pike, whose character is the daughter of the District Attorney (Richard Jenkins). The police detective is played by David Oyelowo and it's easy to tell something isn't completely right with city hall.Reacher roams the beautiful city of Pittsburgh asking questions and piecing together the puzzle left behind by creepy villain The Zec (Werner Herzog) and his henchman Charlie (Jai Courtney). We get three Reacher fistfights, a ""Bullit"" type car chase in a beautiful 1970 Chevelle, and some military sharp-shooting from the depths of a quarry. What we don't get is the Hollywood tradition of a Cruise sprint. Not once do we see his trademark all-out dash to or from something. In fact, he moves much like his Stacey Jaxx character from his recent musical Rock of Ages.Director Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar, and my ever-lasting respect, for his ""The Usual Suspects"" screenplay. This story is infinitely less-complicated, but it does offer some fun moments thanks to the Reacher character. Maybe things would be a little better if a guy like Reacher really existed. Totally off the grid and taking down the bad guys that the cops can't quite catch. Sounds a bit like ""Dexter"", only Reacher's code includes doling out physical pain and then moving on to the next town ... with a new set of Goodwill duds and a fresh toothbrush.Caleb Deschanel (Director of Photography) provides a really sharp look to the film and, thankfully, doesn't cheat on the action scenes. Herzog (a highly respected director) has a great look for a bad guy, but is painfully under-utilized here. Rosamund Pike may simply be my least favorite actress working today. Her limited range is cringe-worthy on multiple occasions and I was thankful that Reacher had no ""interest"" in her. Robert DuVall makes a colorful appearance as the late-arriving character that breaks open the case, and he seems to relish the reunion with his ""Days of Thunder"" co-star. The most interesting character to me was Jai Courtney, who will be seen next as Bruce Willis' son in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"".If you haven't read the Lee Child books, you will probably readily accept Cruise as Reacher. If you are a fan of the franchise, your eyes and brain will have massive conflicts for the first hour, but then acceptance creeps in, and you'll probably agree that it's a simple, effective piece of entertainment ... far superior to most Nicolas Cage movies these days!

tt0790724,5.0,"This movie is a now-familiar exercise in Tom Cruise's narcissism. Every female in the movie, even an elderly woman, flirts with Cruise's character. His role is that of a cliché'd, ""man with no name"" hero who breaks all the rules.I suppose this movie will suffice as a time killer. It's really just the same old, ""resolved-in-two hours"", recycled plot which we are all very familiar with by now, if not completely tired of. The pretty girl is kidnapped and Cruise has to rescue her. He magically avoids bullets.Tom Cruise has no range as an actor. He plays the same stern character in every film. His schtick is getting old.There's a hilarious scene where Rosamund Pike flashes her cleavage directly at us. I really wonder if they spliced that in to wake up the audience."
tt11235772,6.0,"This feels like a throwback to 90s erotic thrillers and I don't mind that. They're usually pretty entertaining regardless of quality and The Voyeurs mostly follows this. The film drags a little bit in the middle, but some wild twists keep things interesting. I kinda wish the film ended after the first big twist because the second was pretty ridiculous. The atmospheric cover of Eyes Without a Face is fantastic and honestly makes the film worth watching just for that. I can't get it out of my head.Oh and my god what is wrong with Justice Smith's voice. Completely took me out of the movie."
tt11235772,6.0,"I liked the overall tone, aesthetics, cast, acting, concept... But the ending was too much. The unreal twists have kind of broken the spell for me. I'd love to see this movie with a simpler more realistic third act."
tt11235772,6.0,"Not only is ""The Voyeurs"" the kind of movie Steven Soderbergh makes, I also wish that he had made it. Michael Haneke, too. These auteurs would have found a style befitting of the material that would have made it seem plausible, that would have kept us engrossed, and that, hopefully, would not have required the ridiculous, jarring twists and turns that the movie ends on.The young couple move into an apartment in Montreal with windows that look directly into an apartment across the street. The very first time they look, they watch the couple in that apartment have sex. They continue to watch, get turned on, and even go so far as planting a listening device.The climactic twist isn't entirely predictable. I wasn't surprised. But still, Soderbergh or Haneke could have put more of a point on it. Here it was a bit ""meh"", as my generation likes to say.I really think that the twists and turns that come after were put in as an afterthought when the director realised nobody was going to buy what he had sold up to that point. It almost feels like a consolation prize, as though he's saying, ""I agree that sucked because I don't have the skill to do it the way Haneke would have... oh well, here's some extra tawdry garbage.""He should have just made an erotic thriller. This is more like ""Sliver"" than ""Benny's Video"" or even ""The Girlfriend Experience"". And an erotic thriller would have been more fun. The attempts at seriousness or social commentary come to nothing, and in the final act, are totally abandoned."
tt11235772,6.0,This was categorized in Amazon as young adult and drama. What?!? This is a seriously dark and twisted erotic thriller with lots of disturbing things happening. I almost didn't watch thinking this was a teenage movie but it's not. Very much for adults only. I feel the reviews are harsh. It's really like two movies in one.
tt11235772,6.0,"I'm a little indifferent about this film.I watch the movie because Sydney Sweeney and Justice Smith were in it. Two actors that I come to enjoy and they were really good in it together.The story was really good too. If the bottom-line plot is that vengeance is an artform, then this movie has an ending that's almost a masterpiece.However, the story could have been handled better. The movie was a little too over reaching with the trivia (like the fact that one of the Voyeurs is an eye doctor). Things I feel that should have come off as subtle seem to be slapping me in the face whenever I turn around.The actors were pretty good at keeping us in the moment but not good enough for me not to see what was coming next in this predicable erotic thriller.As an erotic thriller however its top notch and it had its melodramatic moments that hit in a cool way."
tt11235772,5.0,From interesting to derivative to dumb to ridiculous.
tt11235772,6.0,The story is decent. Doesn't exactly keep you on your toes but does a decent job at entertaining you. There's liberal use of sexually explicit scenes which is intended to carry the film when the plot gets slow. The climax is somewhat unexpected which is nice.
tt9419884,5.0,"So, carrying on from WandaVision, Wanda continues her arc as a slaver who faces no consequences for enslaving a town full of people to now being a mass-murdering slaver who risks the lives of trillions of people's lives, destroys universes, enslaves more people, so she can murder a child, which will help her switch her plan to murder a mother and kidnap her imaginary children.And her redemption arc is she notices she is a monster and ends her reign of terror in the last 2 minutes.And we're meant to sympathise with her for those heinous acts because she is sad because she had to stop imagining her children, and had to stop all the slaving and torture she was doing in order to imagine some fake imaginary children.It was loud and shiny and stupid, so it was fine as totally brainless, lightweight nonsense... Pretty meh overall, and I stopped paying attention during some parts as I was thinking about other things because it was not engaging at all."
tt9419884,6.0,"Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength. However, I felt like there was not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness. Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are inconsistent. This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its own."
tt9419884,5.0,"Doctor Strange became a very popular character, especially after the Endgame events and had a good share of performance in couple of MCU movies thereafter. Multiverse of madness was on a different hype level, however it turned out to be a disappointment affair on some levels.Starting with the storyline, the plot of multiverse and Scarlet Witch as the antagonist was a cool idea, however the execution didn't reciprocate the idea of the story. The first half was decent, with very good special effects and some action with a lot of multiverse moments, that even we weren't able to catch up with the pace of the movie.The main downfall started just as the second half started. Too many characters introduction, with less development of the ongoing story, a lacklustre special effects in many scenes and the shockingly quick pace of the story made the climax very less interesting towards the end. Direction by Sam Raimi was good, but felt flat towards the last 20 minutes or so, of the movie.Putting aside any long-term implications, The Multiverse Of Madness is a frustrating mix of eclectic elements that at times feel more like Raimi referencing his Evil Dead movies than his previous superhero work. Suffice it to say that Multiverse of Madness may find rapturous approval among comic book fans but could be less appealing to mainstream movie-goers.My Rating : 5/10."
tt9419884,6.0,"Xochitl Gomez shows up from an alternate reality and asks for Benedict Cumberbatch's help. She can travel between the various realities, but she has no control over it; when she's in a life-threatening situation, she autonomically zips into a a different world. She's been doing that a lot, since monsters have been attacking her to steal her ability. This is at least the second Dr. Strange she's asked for help -- here's the corpse of another.For reasons of the plot, Cumberbatch goes to Elizabeth Olsen, aka The Scarlet Witch for help. Waddaya know, she's been controlling the demons because she wants to get to an alternate world where she has children -- thus linking into the Disney+ show, Wandavision.Sam Raimi is back directing, and he borrows liberally, not only from earlier superhero movies, but from horror movies. This one has fewer quips than your average Marvel movie, but it does ask questions both overtly ""Are you happy?"" and symbolically. It's not my principal interest, but at a tad over two hours, my bladder didn't force me out of the theater."
tt9419884,6.0,"The overall pacing is relentless and the sequel shows its hand a lot earlier than you'd expect. There's been endless speculation from fans about the villain, which i won't spoil here, but it's revealed surprisingly quickly.You can't help that feel somewhere in the multiverse, there's a better version of this movie that exists."
tt9419884,5.0,"Doctor Strange 2 is the MCU's latest balls-to-the-wall crossover event, and it's noticeably not as well done as everything else was in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The effects and action are nice, but the story squanders a palpable script in favour of frustratingly fragmented (which multiverses can suffer from when stories don't address all the inherent issues of multiple worlds directly interacting with each other) fan-service and even more sequel-fodder with its abrupt cliff-hanger ending (pre-post-creds mind you, but still).Doctor Strange 2 covers its concept of multiverses instead of telling a re-inventive character-driven story like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse had. Doctor Strange 2's got splashes of self-aware humour here and there, but it's gonna have to take some magic to become a film comparable to the MCU's stronger entries.The most notable thing about the film is how many opportunities it squanders with its many supporting characters introduced and then never really getting utilised in the story (except for one). It teases endless narrative possibilities courtesy of the last Spider-Man movie doing so with its lead, but Doctor Strange 2 teases fan service only to deliver shortcomings instead of going all the way with its promise of 'madness' in the title. The good stuff IS there; it just doesn't have enough story-breathing-room in the film.Doctor Strange 2 is definitely a noble attempt at something 'new' for the MCU, and it's sure as hell more confident than Eternals, but it suffers the same character-squandering issues as it.With a universe as vast as Marvel's, not every entry in the MCU was guaranteed to work. At least it tried."
tt9419884,6.0,"So thanks to watching some early reviews on YouTube saying this is more of a Doctor Strange and Wanda movie than a Multiverse movie, I adjusted my expectations and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.And you might say, ""well it's literally called Multiverse of Madness, how do you expect me not to expect a Multiverse from this movie"", which I agree with. I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.First of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!About the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought ""well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours"". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't ""feel"" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.And it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.It would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.For people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!Danny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy. But the score is still good, just wish his iconic theme was used more in this movie.The visuals were amazing too, although it still had some that looked really bad, and it seems like Marvel has been lacking with CGI in this phase more than before, even in the tv shows.But the thing about the visuals is that even though they are great and a joy to witness, I kinda miss the reality-bending we got in the first movie and No Way Home, I wish they used it here too and went crazier with it.And as for the direction, I gotta say it's pretty good and it's obvious Sam Raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie and I loved it. It seems like Marvel is getting a little more open to having visionary directors take the helm and give them freedom. It's obvious that this movie is not given to Sam with 100 percent freedom, but I think they're getting a little bit better and I hope this freedom becomes bigger in the next projects. Sam Raimi does a great job with all the creepy, horror scenes, and the jump scares and this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry and spells. I really hope they keep doing these different genres and don't just stick to action-comedy as they've been for a long time. It's a breath of a fresh air seeing this being a different kind of superhero movie.I also really liked that he actually used a good color grading and that the colors and environments are alive and that they don't look like another bland Marvel movie.I don't think I need to talk about the acting because you already know they all do an amazing job. But surprisingly Wanda is the star of this movie and some people have a problem with that? I get that it's called Doctor Strange and this movie kinda lets Wanda outshine him, but did you also have a problem with Infinity War being more of a Thanos movie, or The Dark Knight is more of a Joker movie? I don't get that people say Doctor Strange had less things to do or even less cool things to do than Infinity War, because it felt to me that they both had more of or the same amount of screen-time and Doctor Strange had obviously more screen time.And America Chavez is a really interesting and a great addition to the MCU and Xochitl Gomez did a good job of portraying her.Some reviews said that Christine Palmer was again underutilized, which I guess? But I don't know what more they could've done with the fast pacing of this movie and I thought they did a decent job with Palmer anyway. Obviously, and as I said before, this movie could've benefited from some breathers and 20 extra minutes, but it was still fine.We also get Ashley Williams of course! And Bruce Campbell is great as ever. You can't have a Sam Raimi movie without Ash!I also heard some people say that they liked the first one better, which it's ok I guess? You could argue that the pacing of the first movie was better and Stephen Strange had a good development in there, but since the villain sucked in that movie, I cannot say that the first one is better. The villain and ""their"" motivation in this movie were far better in this movie, and I guess they had some movies and shows to get more development and it's kinda unfair to compare and say this one had more development because duh. But even if this was their first appearance, they still had a better motivation and were a better character anyway. (I'm using ""they"" to not spoil who the villain is but I think it's obvious for anyone who that is)In conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time. I also forgot to say that there are some loose ends left from the first movie that they didn't deal with for some reason and it's not really a continuation of Doctor Strange as it is more a continuation of WandaVision, and in that case, people are kinda right if they think this wasn't that much of a Doctor Strange movie and more Wanda's.Maybe I'm just a little carried away and I'm giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.Update: Watched it a second time and I think I like it a little less and noticed more problems with it, but I still like it, so I'm changing it to a 7 here."
tt9419884,5.0,"This definitely wasn't what I expected. It started out good and I was thinking: All Right, Here we go. But that didn't last very long. Then it got so chaotic and scattered. It went everywhere and nowhere. Because you couldn't follow it in a meaningful way. I won't give any spoilers. I'll just say that I was highly disappointed. And once I got past the half-hour mark, I actually considered walking out. This film deserved a better script and a more appropriate director. Raimi wasn't the best choice for a Doctor Strange film. Other stuff he's directed, I love. But this was a Hot Mess!"
tt9419884,5.0,"I really miss the old MCU movies where it was making a stand alone super hero movie is simple,
But after (End game) thing changed for better or worse.-During watching the movie I kept wondering, whose movie is it?-Sam Raimi did a great job.i liked the fight scene , the horror elements he adds to the movie it was creative,But it wasn't enough.-The writing was bad and very cheesy.-Where is (Vision ,loki ,TVA ) ??the anticipated heroes cameo were wasted by the worst possible way and disposed of so quickly.-Don't watch it with high exceptions."
tt9419884,6.0,"Man, what a disappointment, expected way more interesting plot as Strange is one of the coolest and most powerful characters - at least so far it seemed, as Wanda just mopped the floor with him and kinda everybody. She is waaaay more overpowered than supposed to and her motive as a main villain? Being with her children in another universe... Rather unoriginal, kinda we got that in Wandavision. The sensation hunting with other universe's characters were not used well or interestingly whatsoever, while that america chavez girl is just a terrible actor with zero chemistry with the stars. Just a weak story, badly used characters, way too much nonsensical ""fight"", was a missed opp, really hoped marvel can still be on that level than before Endgame, however seems Spiderman was the last big hit that was spot on. Thor is the last hope, the rest is seemingly ruined or much lower quality than the predecessors."
tt1441395,6.0,"Until I read someone's explanation of the opening of the movie, there was no way I was going to understand it. It culminated in an eye (which I kind of anticipated). Beyond that, I was clueless, but knew that I was in for an ""interesting"" 90 minutes.One review I read elsewhere stated, ""If you want to see Scarlett Johansson drive around in a van for 90 minutes... go for it!"" While not entirely inaccurate as far as reviews go, it's not all she does in the movie. Having been disappointed again and again by her acting, it made perfect sense to cast her as an emotionless alien predator. In many ways, this is just another take on the vampire genre. It has sci-fi elements scattered about the place, but it's mostly a beautiful exposition of early spring-time Scotland and a terrible characterization of Scottish people.Almost entirely devoid of language, barring the odd, ""Do you have a girlfriend?"" or, ""I'm trying to get to the M8,"" it relies almost entirely on imagery and action to tell the story.Having said that, you may be fooled into thinking that I didn't like the movie at all. I actually enjoyed it. I ""got"" the plot without any problems, though a reading of the novel would definitely fill in some gray areas. But I can't get over the idea that a lot of the plot went on in Scarlett's character's head. Her ultimate empathy for the human race and her desperate bid to break free of her ghoulish task are only partly explained.All in all, not enough plot to cover the time allotted, but I didn't feel scammed or that I'd entirely wasted my time. But definitely not a ""redefining of what it means to be human"" as one reviewer put it.I also have to note that my television turned itself off about halfway through. That's never happened before. Was it trying to tell me something?"
tt1446714,6.0,"The writers intended this to be an ""Alien"" prequel by incorporating ""Chariots of Gods"" into the film, although some might question the timeline. They concentrated on creating a special effects film, putting science facts on the back burner. It's basically 60's science fiction with great special effects.Earth has been visited by aliens who created us, and leave a calling card. Instead of traveling to a moon of Jupiter like in 2001, we travel to a distant ""galactic system"" to a moon of a planet that looks like Saturn. The year is 2091, the crew is placed in suspended animation for a trip that takes 3 years, nearest star is 4.5 light years away. Sirius is the star frequently indicated as that ""ancient"" alien connection. It is 11 light years away. The writers needed to do the math.In this ""2091: A Space Odyssey"" tale, HAL is replaced by an android named David (Michael Fassbender) who like HAL has his own orders. When they get to the planet it turns into a special effects sci-fi horror as man tries to find his ""creator."" Noomi Rapace provides us the only decent human performance in this film. In fact she was so good at one point they called her character, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, ""Noomi"" in the film. They are either paying tribute to the famous Carrie Fischer ""Star Wars"" blooper, or their film editor is Ed Wood.The dialogue was written in such a way that it lacked entertainment value. It needed to be lighter. The theme of creating life, so that it is not special, bogged down the film. In case you are unaware, the earliest common human language was believed to be a form of ""click"" language. I waited for Fassbender to start clicking when he spoke the alien language to show me the extensive research the writers did. It didn't happen.Why is there always some idiot who takes off his helmet to test the air in these films? It's not the oxygen, its the foreign microbes, stupid!Great movie to let the teens go see. Yes, I liked the film, but the writers were a let down. The good news is we can gut part of the voice track and do over the text and make it science fiction presentable without any re-shooting. Heck we might even add a joke or two... ""These two earthlings, one an android, land on this alien planet and say, ""Why did you create us?""....SPOILER: And if you haven't figured it out from watching 3 movies...the reason why we were created is to generate a species genetically similar to the ""creators"" so they could test their biological weapons out on us, i.e. those alien critters.Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, 2 people in bed, near sex, no nudity, brief hot chicks. This would easy have been a 5 star movie had the writers did their homework. BTW, I just removed my own appendix, I am going out now to do some dirt biking."
tt1446714,6.0,"'Alien' is still to this day a tense, shocking suspenseful and frightening masterpiece, one of my favourites of the genre. The bigger and bolder 'Aliens' is one of those rare sequels that is every bit as good as its predecessor. Both are two of my favourite films and the character of Ripley is one of the most iconic female characters in film.To be honest, there were initial doubts about 'Prometheus'. Ridley Scott, as especially proved with 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' and 'Thelma and Louise' has shown that he has a lot of talent as a director, though his filmography is hit and miss. So that he was back on board as director and that there is a great cast promised much. There were worries however as well, due to some negative reception amongst audiences who criticised the script, story and notorious ""plot holes"".Watching 'Prometheus' finally, it was a better film than expected though nowhere near in the same league as 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. That said, it was heavily flawed and there are criticised personally agreed with, though it doesn't deserve the 1/2/10 ratings which indicate that the film had no redeeming qualities at all which is not the case.'Prometheus' best asset is the visuals. The settings look tremendous, of sheer beauty and with a real eeriness, the cinematography complements it perfectly and often powerfully arresting and the special effects are a feast for the eye. Scott's direction has moments where it is superb, if more in the visuals and spectacle than the narrative.More than up to the level of the quality of the visuals is the cast. Noomi Rapace is an authoritative lead, and Michael Fassbender is even better in one of his best performances to date. Charlize Theron and Idris Elba also prove how talented they are as performers. Most of the rest are more than up to their level.While the story is very problematic, it does have its moments. There is some tension, especially in the last act, parts are thought-provoking and there are some thrills. The music is suitably haunting.However, there is a good deal that doesn't work. The script is often very weak, often rambling, clichéd and not very logical with some stupid decision making. The story does suffer from too many concepts not explored enough, some leaden pacing and at times a lack of cohesiveness.Characters are also not particularly well-written, they seemed underdeveloped and there are too many of them, the decision making of some are a cause for extreme frustration. Not to mention lapses in logic, ridiculous science and parts that don't make as much sense as ought.In conclusion, better than expected but heavily flawed and one may question the point of it. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
tt1446714,5.0,"Visually stunning but completely ludicrous tale of scientists going to look for god or at least man's creator on a far off planet.Shades of Wizard of Mars and Star Trek 5. Of course there are monsters, but mostly there are some really stupid people doing some really stupid things in order to drive the plot.No one behaves like a normal person anywhere in this film with the result being that the film is driven forward simply because people refuse to do the rational thing.I saw this at a sneak preview at Lincoln Center and at no point did anyone jump. The only reaction were applause at references to Ridley Scott's Alien and laughter in the final half hour as things got more and more silly.That the film works at all is thanks to a some odd set pieces that seem to be operating in a vacuum and to an incredible visual style that keeps the audience interested even when any rational person would have walked out.A huge miss by Scott."
tt1446714,6.0,"In December 2093, after two years of hibernation of the seventeen crew members, the scientific spaceship Prometheus arrives in an unknown planet expecting to find the Enginners that have created mankind on Earth. The scientists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) are sponsored by the corporation of the millionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) and travel with a team including the android David (Michael Fassbender) and Weyland's daughter Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). Sonn they find that their discovery is not what they expected and the human race may be destroyed by their creators.I had the greatest expectations with ""Prometheus"" based on the hype around it, but I found it an overrated and flawed mess. Despite of that, if the viewer turns off his or her brain, he or she may like it despite the confused and boring story with silly existentialistic questions; stupid characters and unreasonable situations, but excellent cinematography and special effects.The writers could have worked a little harder and avoid imbecilities in the plot such as: (a) How could a trillion-dollar scientific expedition be supported by a thesis based on what the scientist has chosen to believe? (b) How could a scientist tell to the member responsible for the security to bring no weapons with him in an unknown environment since they are a scientific expedition? (c) How could scientists remove a helmet from a being without wearing masks despite the device has been submitted to a decontamination procedure? (d) Why should a scientist stay drinking in a room where an important research is carried out? (e) How could two scientists act like morons with an unknown creature with a snake form? (f) How could a woman be submitted to a cesarean procedure run and jump stapled pretty after the surgery? (g) Why the crew members open the spaceship gate to a member assumed dead without any previous investigation? (h) Why sometimes to create it is necessary to destroy? (i) The heroic act of the captain's officers is typical from Hollywood movies. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Prometheus"""
tt1446714,6.0,"Most of what I would say has already been said. I especially agree with the fact that a crew trained in intergalactic travel probably couldn't tie their own shoes. They do so many stupid thing that could have terminated the voyage in a heartbeat. There is no caution, no restraint. I'm not sure we are ever very clear on the mission itself. And what's in it for some of these guys? By the way, did it seem odd that a guy is wearing glasses when this voyage was made?"
tt1446714,6.0,"Wow, over 1300 user comments makes it seem almost pointless to add one more, but here are my thoughts (I'll keep them brief).To anyone who's a fan of the ""Alien"" series, ""Prometheus"" will probably supply some at least modest fun, as there are enough tie-ins to the earlier films to keep you engaged. To others, it might seem like an esoteric and obscure sci-fi film that fades instantly from memory after it's over.The slavering fanboys will have you believe this is the most profound movie ever made. It's not. The fact that it tries to be and fails is only one of its problems. It would have been much better if it had not tried quite so hard; the beauty of the first two ""Alien"" movies is that neither had great ambitions to be anything other than fiendishly entertaining horror/action movies, and they both succeed tremendously on their terms. ""Prometheus"" wants to be something more, but it plays like something conceived in great detail in Ridley Scott's head but only put down on film in vague outlines. There are all sorts of questions the movie raises that it doesn't answer. Fanboys will tell you that that's the sign of a brilliant movie and that you're a dolt if you can't answer the questions on your own. But there's a difference between purposeful ambiguity that serves a narrative purpose and ambiguity that results from bad writing. When you ask the audience to fill in too many blanks on their own, you're just being lazy.""Prometheus"" seems like a good movie while you're watching it (though even then it really starts to fall apart in its second half), but the more you think about it later, the worse and worse it seems.Grade: B"
tt6259380,6.0,"Code 8 is a decent enough film, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was worth skipping by, superhero builders and drugs taken from people's body bits, but it really isn't bad.Some nice ideas and some good special effects, it's not a huge budget film, but somehow they make it work. Don't expect Marvel, and don't expect Breaking Bad, but do expect a few interesting moments. Every single cliche under the sun is here, there's not a huge amount of originality, but enjoy it for what it is.I wonder if those that have given this 1 and 10 star reviews have actually seen this, those I've read with such extreme scores do not relate to this movie.Decent acting, Robbie Amell will of course have his fans, 6/10."
tt6259380,6.0,"Code 8It is obvious that this Indie Sci-Fi from Director Jeff Chan takes inspiration from the X Men franchise but it also has a Neill Blomkamp vibe.
Set in a world where some humans have extraordinary gifts.
These powered individuals live in poverty. Their gifts are more of a burden and anyone caught using their special abilities must answer to the law.
A powered construction worker played by Robbie Amell falls in with a criminal gang when he desperately needs to raise money for his sick mother.As aforementioned this film is heavily influenced by the X Men movies but it does have its own unique premise.
Sadly the execution of this premise is slightly lacking.
Performances by all are commendable. The audience will grow to care for what happens to those onscreen due to some decent acting.
However this story would have been better told as a TV series rather than a 1hr 38min movie.
The world which is created onscreen is one that can be expanded upon.
An episodic TV show would have allowed the created universe and characters to flourish.
I have read somewhere that Robbie and Co-star Stephen Amell are actually developing a continuation for the small screen.Considering that this films production budget was crowd funded and was only a measly $2.1 million the special effects are really quite impressive.
This is where the Neill Blomkamp vibe becomes apparent.
The robotic police officers in the movie reminded me of the robot designs in 'Elysium' or perhaps 'Chappie'.
But it is painfully obvious that it is just a man in a suit rather than a CGI creation.
This is where budget constraints are visible.
Still the aerial shots of the drones deploying the robots was rather cool.
This is a film that does punch above its weight in terms of the visuals effects.'Code 8' is certainly worth checking out. It's probably a movie that won't linger in the memory banks for long but the expansion of the universe created by this film in the form of a TV show would be most welcome."
tt6259380,6.0,"Worth watching for a decent mashup of Sci-Fi and Heist genres.

The plot uses the usual clichés of the crime genre. The sci-fi and the abilities are only to disguise. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Code 8: Renegades"" (""Code 8: Renegades"")"
tt6259380,5.0,"It is a passable movie with good looking, made for TV, leads and reasonable effects. That said, my guess is that was intended to be a pilot for a TV series and they changed their mind at the last minute, hence the crappy ending."
tt6259380,6.0,It's Dec 2019 and I can safely count on both hands films that I've thoroughly enjoyed this year and Code 8 is one of the them. Mid budget Scfi drama at its best. Watchable once and maybe again a year or two from now. A definite go.
tt6259380,6.0,"I will start out by saying that the movie is not great, but I can also say that it doesn't deserve as much flack as it's getting. A thing some have been talking about was that it doesn't add anything new and while it is true, I also don't think it needs to. The movie is enjoyable to watch and it definitely had potential. My complaint with this movie is with the characters. The characters have little to no development or depth. Again I want to restate that it's not a bad movie, at points, you can feel as if the characters could be real people and connect with them. However these moments are cliche and very few. At it's worst, the movie will throw ideas in the air and never come back to them. Special effects are very well done and don't let down. The plot was generic but still enjoyable. Overall, this movie is good for casual audiences and people that just wanna sit down and turn off their brain for an hour after a long day. If you want something with a lot more to offer than this then I wouldn't recommend watching this movie."
tt6259380,6.0,"Nothing special,but engaging enough to keep my interest to the end.

tt6259380,5.0,"Wow, this film.Great start, cool (although unrealistic) ideas, nice action, good effects and cool designs.While watching the film I learned that there was a relevant short and this film was crowdfunded. This hyped me up even more. Everything was great (besides some acting and pacing issues) up until the ending.I try to not get disappointed by films but this film actually hyped me up because I love independent and interesting sci-fi.And then the ending hit me like a freight train. It's so unimaginative, so boring, so cliche. They never took any risks, they never tried to surprise, to play off the characters they've had.While watching this I got that Upgrade (2018) vibe. I really thought that they will do something insanely cool with their ending (like Upgrade did). And this one was the most boring and off-putting thing ever imagined.Sorry, guys, but as much as I wanted to give this film 8/10 just to promote independent sci-fi, this film just struck me right through the heart. What. A. Letdown."

tt5755238,6.0,"'Leo' is a film with a message. It cleverly introduces us to very different characters to convey powerful messages about different members of our society. Being an animated film and aimed at a young demographic, 'Leo' can almost serve as an educational video to youngsters - and they will be thoroughly entertained at the same time. In the process, they will learn about insecurity, vanity, and various misconceptions kids might have about life.Leo is a lizard, who has been living in captivity for 74 years. Erm, correction, he's been the class pet since 1949 and lives in a glass cabinet in a classroom, with his best friend Squirtle the turtle. With their beloved teacher going on maternity leave, the class now faces a strict, elderly substitute teacher, Mrs Malkin. In order to teach them responsibility, she suggests a pupil takes home one of the class pets for a weekend to care for them.And so the kids in turn take home Leo, who turns out to be a talking lizard. To each kid, Leo tells them they are the only one able to hear him, and in the process he has a profound impact on their lives as he gives them advise on their personal dilemmas. My favourite character was Eli, a kid with over-protective parents who has a drone to look after him. The drone itself was a delightful and funny character.With many scenes being very cartoonish and a bit silly, this film is definitely more for kids. Having said that, it is still a film adults will enjoy, too, and there are indeed many very funny moments. Towards the end it also becomes an action-packed adventure.The only thing I didn't like about the movie, was all the constant singing. Ever since the huge success of 'Frozen', so many animated movies since features musical segments. It's like found footage movies that overstayed its welcome. I get it, young kids like so sing or hum to a catchy melody when they watch cartoons, but I found it a little annoying. Oh, go on, call me a grump if you must...In general, 'Leo' is an enjoyable film, and yes, I definitely enjoyed it."
tt5755238,6.0,"Adam Sandler has, in particular, made two very smart decisions in his career. One was starring in Punch-Drunk Love and proving that he is secretly one of the finest actors of our time. The other was starring in Hotel Transylvania. By branching out into animation geared towards families, Sandler found a proper vehicle for his silliest abilities and doing so without alienating people with the kind of overly juvenile humor that plagued his comedy movies in the 2000's. He's back voicing an elderly and wise lizard in Leo. Folks, I mean this without a hint of irony when I say that Leo is very nearly the funniest movie of the year. I expected to like this movie, but I didn't expect to laugh as much as I did. Credit belongs to veteran SNL writer, Robert Smigel. Leo is filled to the brim with a Shrek 2-caliber of amazing sight gags. Plus, it has the funniest interpretation of kindergarteners that I've ever seen. As for Adam Sandler, he brings a level of warmth and goofiness to his character that felt like a loving tribute, both in style and tone, to the late, great, Gilbert Gottfried. No, this isn't a lame showcase of a new Sandler voice that will drive you mental by the 10-minute mark. Leo is a lovable protagonist. The cringey and forced musical numbers hold this thing back from being a pretty solid animated movie all around."
tt15791034,6.0,"UGH .... so close - SO CLOSE! But in the end, no cigar. All that potential and solid storytelling dissolving into to a nonsensical, clumsy, rushed, and ultimately unsatisfying conclusion, implementing all of the worst elements of horror movies. That's what disappoints the most. This movie held so much promise and had such a great start and journey all the way up until the end, but sadly the writer(s) somehow couldn't find the way to keep that strong storytelling up to par all the way through to the end. It wasn't that I disliked the end result. It was the clumsy way the screenplay got us there that left a lot to be desired. I was rolling my eyes on multiple occasions during parts of the final act. Video review to come soon."
tt15791034,6.0,"This movie has A LOT of positive traits. The plot is interesting and there are some genuinely scary details in it. Unfortunately the plot is also very scattered, some of the choice do not make sense and the further the plot developers, the weirder it all gets.The beginning is actually very good. You don't know what is going on, it's fascinating to find out what is going on. The acting is great, Bill Skarsgård is one of my favorite actor and it was a nice surprise to see him in this. But when Justin Long comes to the picture, the plot loses the intense feeling and the threat. Long's character is way over the top and all the way through his character and intentions do not make sense. They force this #MeToo plot point in the story and it bring the story down quite a bit.There are some genuine scary moments in this, and even though I am a horror addict and seen some scary stuff, this movie manages to frighten me a few times. If they had managed to keep the story more coherent and intact, it would've been a better experience.The last 20 minutes are just bad. I have heard some bad things about American cops but in this movie they do not seem even human and it's weird. The water tower scene is actually bad and Justin Long's character ruins it for good.It's very frustrating to see great potential in something and then see it wasted. First half is a solid 8 and the second half is 5 at best. It's 6,5 average, but I'm lowering in to 6 because of the wasted potential."
tt15791034,6.0,"Barbarian features a warped premise that could have been amazingly terrifying and unique, but which doesn't quite click, despite a decent cast and solid direction from Zach Cregger, who also wrote the film. I think my issue is that the basic set-up offers opportunities to go to some seriously dark and twisted places, but the final product only goes part of the way.Georgina Campbell plays Tess, who books an Airbnb in Detroit so that she can attend a job interview; however, when she arrives in what appears to be very bad neighbourhood, the property is already occupied by a young man, Keith (Bill Skarsgård), who claims that he has also rented the house. With nowhere else to go, Tess accepts Keith's offer for her to stay the night. Tension and uneasiness is established, Keith's behaviour seemingly off.Keith, as it turns out, isn't the danger, for unbeknownst to either of the occupants, hidden behind a secret door in the cellar is a network of rooms and passageways, home to a hideous inbred mutant mother who captures people to keep as her 'babies'.That sounds messed up, and it is, but Cregger's script doesn't fully exploit it's potential. At it's weirdest, disgraced Hollywood actor AJ (Justin Long), owner of the house, is forced to suckle from the mutant mother's breast (Long sure picks 'em!), but I wanted much more from the film: the mother should have been seen putting AJ in a diaper, spooning disgusting food into his mouth, putting him in a cradle etc. AJ is such a slimeball that he deserves to suffer more.I would also have liked to have seen more of the backstory: a flashback shows weirdo Frank (Richard Brake) preparing for the birth of one of his children by shopping for baby goods, but the film glosses over how he abducted women and used them to bear his kids in his underground lair, and how these children grew up to have more children, until the result was the deformed mutant we see in the film. The comparisons to Josef Fritzl are interesting and it would have been good to have seen them explored further.However, when all is said and done, Barbarian is still a fun ride, with plenty of atmosphere, another enjoyable turn from Long, a great 'creature', and a bit of gore, so I doubt horror fans will come away disappointed. I just wanted it to be crazier.6/10."
tt15791034,5.0,"What would you do, your Airbnb has two, when you arrive someone is there, a double booking, would you just share? Would you put yourself in danger, with a complete and total stranger, perhaps enjoy a glass of wine, would you really cross that line?This is a film that won't test your full cognition, if you found you were in a similar scenario or situation, not just at the start when the choices might be limited, but later when you find yourself in places quite inhibited.This could have been a spectacular piece of film making but there are far too many tangents, dangling ends and nonesensicals, defying the laws of physics was the least of them."
tt21909764,6.0,"My fault is the newest Spanish teen-drama romance that feels like a mixture of Through my Window, Three Steps Above Heaven and Fast and Furious.Noah is upset with her mother as she has to leave her boyfriend and friends and move in with her mother's new rich husband and his son Nick. Nick is a typical bad boy turns good boy, and their romance is a typical forbidden step-sibling relationship surrounded by gangsters, wannabes and rich kid problems.The storyline is far from realistic, the dialogue is quite dull, but there is chemistry between the actors and it is entertaining enough. At least it was for me, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea."
tt21909764,5.0,"Overall it's not a terrible movie, there were some major downfalls along with successes throughout. Keep in mind that this movie is based on a young adult trilogy and therefore there are quite a bit of clichés along with taboo topics utilized within the plot. I have not read this book series and am only basing my review on the film.The film starts out with Noah and her mother moving in with their new family, in a huge mansion along the beach. Keep in mind that Noah is 17, and has a lot of past trauma from her father so she is not as welcoming to this new family as she is young with a lot of growing up to do. Some viewers might see her behavior as bratty, but to be fair she is a teenager that has been completely uprooted from her life that she grew comfortable within.Nicholas is also young, 22 I think, and he is portrayed as this Casanova. Shortly into the film it is revealed that he is the leader of this gang that races cars, holds underground fights, and raging parties. While his trauma is never fully developed, it is suggested to be based around his mother who abandoned him when she divorced his father. Despite this, he has a loving brotherly relationship with his half sister who has diabetes.The beginning of the film starts out at a great pace, with great development of the hateful relationship between the step siblings and the love between Nicholas' father and Noah's mother. As the film progresses there are large time gaps that are attempted to be filled by mere words revealed by one of the characters within a conversation. The film soon solely focuses on Noah and Nicholas with random scenes sprinkled in of other characters. The supporting characters soon feel lost in the film.The main dilemma within this film stems from Noah's trauma caused by her father. While the viewer gets snippets of what happened throughout the film, there is still many essential pieces of information lost. I wonder if there will be a second film following the plot of the book trilogy that will reveal more about Noah's family's past as she copes with her father's death.While there were issues with the plot and the depth of the character's backstories, the overall chemistry, which seems to be the main focus of the film, between Nicholas and Noah is portrayed well.So if you like cliché young adult films with taboo themes, give this film a watch, I'm sure it won't dissapoint."
tt21909764,6.0,"My Fault, the latest romantic comedy flick, offers a familiar and straightforward storyline accompanied by over-the-top action sequences. While the movie falls victim to a slow pace and lacks a unique twist, it still manages to provide decent entertainment for those seeking a lighthearted romantic comedy or simply looking for a fun way to pass the time.One notable aspect that sets My Fault apart from traditional rom-coms is its inclusion of over-the-top action sequences. These unexpected bursts of excitement inject an element of thrill into an otherwise straightforward storyline.However, one area where My Fault falls short is in its pacing. The movie struggles to maintain a consistent rhythm, occasionally feeling sluggish and dragging out certain scenes unnecessarily. The slow pacing dampen the overall enjoyment, leaving me wishing for a tighter and more dynamic progression of events.In terms of production value, My Fault excels. The cinematography captures vibrant and visually appealing settings, enhancing the film's romantic atmosphere. The well-executed soundtrack complements the narrative, heightening emotional moments and adding to the overall appeal of the movie.Ultimately, My Fault is a decent film that provides an entertaining escape for rom-com enthusiasts or those looking for a light-hearted and enjoyable viewing experience. While the basic storyline and occasionally slow pacing may deter some people like me, the inclusion of over-the-top action and the overall charm of the film make it a suitable choice for a time-pass movie night."
tt0119558,5.0,"As a 14 year old in 1921 Cannes France, Humbert fell in love with older Annabelle but she dies from Typhus. In 1947, Humbert Humbert (Jeremy Irons) starts a professor job in New England. He rents a room from Charlotte Haze (Melanie Griffith) who has a flirtatious 14 year old daughter Lolita (Dominique Swain). Humbert ends up marrying dislikeful Charlotte to stay close to Lolita. Charlotte discovers Humbert's secret lust for Lolita and gets killed by a car. Humbert drives Lolita on a road trip but lies to her about her mother. There is always Clare Quilty (Frank Langella) around.The opening shot of Lolita is way too thirsty. The sprinklers getting her wet is completely over the top. It reeks of desperation from trying to top Kubrick. It's like a bad teenie porno. Melanie Griffith is an inferior Charlotte. Her character is smaller and less interesting as a minor role in this film. In another anti-Kubrick move, Quilty is reduced back to his original size. Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain take up most of the space in this over 2 hours movie for better or worst. Dominique does a nice job. Jeremy Iron is a great actor as always.My biggest problem is that his character is constantly the victim in this version. He is superb in convincing the validity of his love for Lolita. Jeremy Iron does this sympathetic weakness. He does the same thing in 'Damage' but in this case, it's very off-putting. It goes beyond the fear of discovery. While it may be more true to the intention, it makes it a harder thing to watch. I always wonder what the movie would be like from Lolita's point of view. By the last act, I got very tired of Humbert and his patheticness. At that point, I found his narration like fingernails on the chalkboard. The movie is already too long and I couldn't wait for it to be over."
tt9362930,5.0,"I found Blue Beetle as the most basic teenage superhero origins story that are no longer special, and it leaves me no impress whatsoever because we all already way too familiar with this type of story, it's predictable and literally nothing new, it's bland and the action was boring, my face was literally straight the whole time, and the villain was also meh, what i like about Blue Beetle was the family dynamic that's definitely there, and the family itself as their own was good enough, Bruna Markuezine was good, including Xolo Maridueña himself was good and just if his story wasn't the same like most of teenage superhero origins story, Blue Beetle would've been something else because what i do like again was some of the cinematography, editing, the Blue Beetle suit was amazing and i really love it, and the special effects for the most part was good, but again overall i just can't found something new in terms of story, and it would've been just an ok movie but it's too bad that the action was boring and the comedy also didn't work, the villain wasn't that good, so it is what it is unfortunately, Blue Beetle is not a bad movie, it's a basic teenage superhero origins that fills with ok performances but a predictable and unoriginal story and also boring action and uninteresting villain."
tt9362930,6.0,"""Blue Beetle"" is simply B or even C grade super hero movie with some charm along the way. I don't think it will be realistic to expect something else to be honest. The trailers showed that pretty well in my opinion.The tone of the movie is close to that of ""Shazam!"", given the fact that the family got bigger role in it again, that said the story is not all that good. Not that ""Shazam!"" got some epic story, but I think it was one idea better.The cast is fine, maybe the best part of the movie is the family dynamic, except when they lean too much to the melodrama side. Xolo Maridueña as Jaime/Blue Beetle and George Lopez are the standouts no doubt.The villain is everything you ca expect from B grade super hero movie, from the introduction, through his motivation, the fights and the conclusion is nothing particularly memorable.I must say the suit looks great when is practical and not CGI all over the place. There are some cool fight scenes with our protagonist, most of which are shown in the trailers, which is kinda of a shame.There are plenty of jokes in the movie, but for me, most of them doesn't land. I mean they are too childish. I guess the younger auditory will laugh out hard, but me and my cinema crowd were silent most of the time. Of course there were funny moments, but don't expect ""Deadpool"" level laughs if you are a bit older.The movie is not bad, but it's kinda cringe, predictable and given the fact that the audience know this genre already, they expect something more clever, which sadly to report ""Blue Beetle"" is not.There are already enough talks about the future of this character, is it part of the DCEU or DCU, will there be a sequel, or the character will transfer in the newly formed universe? If you ask me, there will not be a second movie, because this one will bomb hard, also, I'm not sure how you can do clean slate without the bagage of the previous universe, when you always lean to what was, not what it can be. In other words there is always a chance to see Blue Beetle again, but who will portray it and will the origin story be 1:1 identical is something I'm not sure about and I don't hold my breath for it.In conclusion the movie is ""okay"", got its moments, but there is nothing really memorable, also there are two credit scenes, which are fine I guess."
tt9362930,6.0,"For what it's worth, this is not an origin story yet is designed to be one, atleast for the main lead. After graduation, Jaime Reyes returns back to his family who are near bankrupt and on the verge to lose their home. Desperate to save the house, he looks for a job and lands at Kord Tower, after an invitation from Jenny Kord. Meanwhile, Kord Industries CEO Victoria Kord, is a greedy woman who wants to control an alien species Scarab for it's technological power, to create a deadly weapon. Jenny's attempt to steal this Scarab leads to Jaime getting hold of it and eventually becoming the host. What follows is, Jaime realizing his purpose and acknowledging his connection with Scarab.Blue Beetle clearly has arrived a decade late, which is also what works in it's favour. There is no pressure of building in/adding on to the DC universe. All it aims for, is to be a simple silly fun entertainer, going over the top at every opportunity and yet succeed in entertaining. This is simply not the kind of film one should take seriously. The humor is hit and miss, thankfully the emotions work well. The Latino superhero does leave a lasting impression. There is not much about the Scarabs so the film directly focuses on Reyes becoming the new Blue Beetle while casually dropping the fact that there were others before.Susan Sarandon's Victoria isn't evil enough whereas her own weapon Carapax isn't menacing enough and are barely serviceable. What does work is the goofiness of the Reyes family and right dose of father-son dynamic, because what's a DC superhero without that? The action set pieces are generic and like I said, the film still delivers on providing basic harmless entertainment. The post credit scene does set it up for a standalone sequel without burdening itself from being part of DCU's planned future."

tt4123432,5.0,"The Harry Potter books achieved so much success because a dedicated writer thought about the story for years and the result, imperfect as it was, became beloved by millions of people as the effort showed. This film is perfect, though, a total and complete mess, written by people who can never come up with more than an elevator pitch and the crave for a big payout. The movie uses a plot that purposefully makes no sense, built on a previous film that no one remembers and manages to cement Dumbledore as a manipulative asshole whose value for humanity is that he looks nice compared to the genocidal maniacs he fights against. But he's gay, so that's fine.It gets worse, though. So many things in the film not only not make sense, but contradict lore from the books. The film is called Fantastic Beasts, but really it's just one and it doesn't do much except for the ending. The magical world of wizards is now angry, political, divided and warlike, because that's what Americans are like, obliterating the elegant traditionalist Britishness of the books. Magic is only used to show off, fight or destroy now.The more I think about it, the angrier I become, which is not really what I want or need. My advice is to skip this film completely. Too bad, too, because Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Dan Fogler and Mads Mikkelsen did a great job as actors. Alas, the material they had to work with was utter garbage."
tt4123432,6.0,"The Secrets of Dumbledore is convoluted by inconsequential plotlines and redundant characters. It's so unfocused, it doesn't have a consistent tone or protagonist. The film centers around wizarding politics, but doesn't elaborate on them. This shrinks the Potterverse and satisfies nobody. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Law's protagonist duet is equally unsatisfying. Oddly, no character feels essential (besides Grindelwald) and action sequences don't progress the story. Ultimately, the movie is overstuffed and develops nothing. Mikkelsen and Fogler excel in their limited roles, but they're sparse in this jumble. Without streamlining, The Secrets of Dumbledore is emotionally uninspired.Technically, The Secrets of Dumbledore is disappointing. First, the effects are overdone. Earlier action is compelling, but the finale is undercut by excessive CGI. Plus, the production design in that final act feels empty. Squandering the union of fantasy and period dressings, the climax is woefully shallow. Furthermore, the editing is bloated and arbitrary because scenes don't influence one another. Lastly, the imagery is drab due to needlessly muted colors and plain framing. The solid music, impressive cast, and meaningful sound can only go so far. Overall, The Secrets of Dumbledore might please some, but is unlikely to leave an impression.Writing: 5/10

tt4123432,5.0,"The first 'Fantastic Beasts' film was very enjoyable. While having its fair share of problems, namely over-stuffing which affected the coherence, there was also a lot to like about the second, with Johnny Depp having much more of a chance to shine and shine he did. So seeing the third was definitely on the cards, despite its troubled behind the scenes with Depp's firing and the JK Rowling controversy which has affected the franchise's popularity this reviewer thinks.Was also really interested in seeing how Depp's replacement Mads Mikkelsen would fare as Grindelwald. Am someone who has a very high opinion of Mikkelsen and there are not many actors who can play villains as well as he. When seeing it in the cinema some months ago, my thoughts were mixed to midlly positive at first. When thinking over it more recently when finally getting round to reviewing, this reviewer actually found herself liking it less and feeling more strongly about the problems. Of the three, it's for me the weakest (and no, that it doesn't have Depp in it has nothing to do with it) as the first two at least felt like 'Fantastic Beasts' whereas this felt like a distant relative.'Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore' does have good things. It looks absolutely fantastic, with stunning set/production design, very atmospheric photography and effects that really do give off a sense of wonder. The music is rousing in spots, eerily haunting in others, jaunty in others and melancholic in others. Really liked that Newt had more to do and was more incidental to the story. When the beasts do feature, they are fun. Niffler steals every scene he appears in. Liked the Quilan too.Of all the scenes in the film, it does start off very well and intriguingly, everything with Dumbledore intrigues and evokes some nice unforced nostalgia and the climax did excite initially. But the highlight is the riotously bizarre dance as part of a particularly perilous escape, a scene that also had a lot of nail biting tension. It is well performed, Eddie Redmayne continues to be well cast as Newt and Dan Vogler has a lot of fun moments. Ezra Miller is quietly intense and Jude Law is nobly charismatic. Mikkelsen is always going to be compared to Depp, and while it is a very different interpretation and more James Bond villain-like Mikkelsen is still very menacing in a subtle way.Against all of that, there is a lot wrong. It was good that the plotting is more streamlined/straightforward and more coherent than the second, but it does suffer still from not doing enough with too many plot strands. Coming off worst is the Yusuf Kama subplot and role, which are completely incongruous to the story and could have been left out entirely because absolutely nothing is done with it. Credence's story, after so much promising build up and some nice suspense still, felt rather rushed.Moreover, 'Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore' is too long by about twenty minutes, tightening the pace, exciting Kama's role and storyline and trimming down a little some of the last act would have solved this. Didn't like too the script's annoying tendency to over-explain, too much telling and not enough show and too much of a reliance on background exposition. Really wish that there was more of the beasts, when they do appear they are fun (though only Niffler is properly memorable) but they are very under-utilised and have very little role in the story. Excepting a nice build up, the ending felt very anti-climactic and incomplete and is a type of ending that this reviewer doesn't care about usually in case another instalment or two is not done.In conclusion, very conflicted here and couldn't have feeling disappointed. 5/10."
tt4123432,6.0,"I am from the Harry Potter generation, I grew up with the books and the movies so there's no denying that I am a massive fan of the saga, so when the first news of prequels came out I was as you might imagine expectant!I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie, sure it lacks the originality and the magic of the original Potter films but it had one thing I really liked: it didn't force itself to be a part of the former stories while still being engaging and clearly happening in the same ""Universe"".This changed a bit when the second movie came around, Crimes of Grindelwald made a clear shift on the story and started to force itself in the ""Harry Potter"" timeline by navigating through the past of some of the beloved characters present in the original movies.And now the third.. where things just simply go sideways, not only it tries to explore even further Dumbledore's past, but fails miserably on doing so. There are a lot of points in the story that simply make no sense at all, the most annoying being the fact that most characters on screen have absolutely no influence on the plot, they are extras in their own film. Grindelwald ""rise to power"" is so forced, senseless and so generic to the point of being cringe..
It almost doesn't feel like a Wizarding World movie, the only reason I won't rate it lower is the creatures are indeed a great addition and being able to see Hogwarts always brings good memories, but that's about it in terms of positive aspects.The Credence plot is pointless after two movies developing it, the climax of the story feels empty after 140 minutes of waiting, the magic these days is used as generic fantasy movie would depict it with complete disregard of the ""Potter rules"", people throwing spells here and there without pronouncing them and us (the audience) not understanding what actually is going on.. They took the magic out and inserted the desire for money, it's sad for Potter fans around the world."
tt4123432,6.0,"In pleasing a result, the third entry into the Fantastic Beasts franchise (a franchise that seemingly exists with support but no dedicated fanbase or huge fanfare) is a marked improvement on the dire misstep that was 2018's The Crimes of Grindelwald, even if Harry Potter veteran director David Yates still can't find the real magic to enliven this wizarding world property to a level that would have it competing in the same space as the beloved films that came before this J. K Rowling property.Becoming less and less about the titular beasts that started this Eddie Redmayne lead adventure all the way back in 2016 and more about trying to draw in extra audience engagement and enthusiasm by bringing back known staples such as Hogwarts and a much more prevalent Albus Dumbledore into this latest outing, you can see the battle raging between Fantastic Beasts trying to figure out exactly what it is and who its for and its a battle that isn't won clearly by the conclusion of this third outing, making it a sometimes frustratingly cold experience that still manages to entertain to decent degree.Without a clear identity or even a character we can truly call our own, with Redmayne's Newt Scamander getting to do his awkward shtick here once more but feeling more like a bystander to whats going on around him, with new addition Mads Mikkelsen's Grindelwald growing in power and his old acquaintance Dumbledore trying to assemble a crack team to help thwart his plans, Fantastic Beasts is hamstrung by its inability to focus its attention into a specific story arc or character journey, with its drab grey and gloomy sets, dark themes and heavy topics feeling rather unmagical for a film that potentially could've finally shed the shackles of past expectations to really let fly with some inventiveness and spark.There are snippets of such things here, a prison escape and some brief moments spent back in the halls of Hogwarts but for a majority of the films two hour plus runtime there's not a whole lot of memorable moments delivered in Yates film, which is by no means offensively bad or incoherent like much of Crimes of Grindelwald was but it still makes you wish someone could take hold of this property and turn it into the possibly great series it could be, something that is unlikely now with two films left to come.While not inspiring much jaw-dropping or magical chills, there's still an undeniable cinematic goodness to Rowling's magic filled universe and there is a feeling here that with Dumbledore building his ragtag group of foot soldiers and with Mikkelsen giving Grindelwald a significant amount of menace and unnerving energy, there's hope yet still that the final chapters of Rowling's mid-tier and seemingly unloved property can still work to a level that will ensure we walk away from the Fantastic Beasts series indifferent in ways but not upset at what's been done to our beloved world of wizards, witches and muggles (and the odd beast or two).Final Say -Still far removed from even the lesser of the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is a small step back in the right direction following the crimes of the last entry and while its still not awe-inspiring by any stretch of the imagination, its a passable diversion of anyone with a passing interest in the Harry Potter cannon.3 crab walks out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
tt4123432,6.0,"The Fantastic Beast Movies should have been about Newt Scamander and friends going on wild and crazy adventures where they run into or face numerous mythical beasts. Imagine Newt interacting with an infant Fluffy (from HP Sorcerers Stone) or taming a Hungarian Horntail. Unfortunately, the fantastic beasts are overshadowed by the Dumbledore VS Grindelwald conflict. However, the film contained stunning visuals and great character performances; but lacked the tension and pizzaz required for a final battle. Worth a watch but falls short with the fantastic beasts being cast aside for a plot that does not entirely deliver."
tt4123432,6.0,"Was the third installment in the Fantastic Beast ""universe"" a succes?Well, the main storyline was okey but the rest of it was kinda unimportant and not that interesting..
Also like i had with the previous two installments was the lack of intensity and emotions in the action scenes.And after 3 completed movie i still can't find my connection with most of the characters especially the main one's.The ""recasting"" of Johnny Depp was a huge mistake for the development of Grindelwald's character!One of the outstanding parts were the CGi and special effects so enjoyable and well created.Also the Harry Potter references were nice, lovely and not overdone
It's a overall good movie but not one to rewatch weekly like the other two, it's pretty predictable with more forgettable moments than remembered once's.I really wanted to like it more but it just didn't really worked out for me..."
tt4123432,5.0,"A movie with some solid ideas for character development and a promising overall plotline that constantly loses itself in meaningless subplots and ridicoulus moments of mere fan service. Overall the movie ended up being a visually impressive gathering of missed opportunities.Instead of focusing on Newt, Dumbledore or Grindelwald the writers included screentime filling action for a number of side characters that does not influence the outcome at all. This only prevents the main story from progressing and (apart from the admittedly hilarious sidekick Kowalski) creates passages that you just have to endure.Plus the faceless army of Grindelwald's followers is so utterly incompetent that there never is any real danger to the heroes. They get shot down like puppets in a 15:1 strength ratio, are knocked out by Quidditch balls that wouldn't even cause a twelve-year-old any problems (see Harry Potter Part 2) and get beaten up by a Muggle with a suitcase.The whole ""we meet at Hogwarts to make a plan to save the world""-scene could have been replaced by a simple letter and wasn't any more than an excuse to include the castle in the trailer."
tt8338076,5.0,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After reluctantly agreeing to move into a senior's home, a 90-year old woman encounters a clique of mean-spirited senior women and an unexpected amorous widower. Some people are describing this movie as a mix between
Mean Girls and The Golden Girls, but that's not entirely accurate.The comedy was directed by Michael Lembeck who also brought us sugary-sweet comedies like The Santa Clause & The Santa Clause 2, Tooth Fairy, and a bunch of TV shows. I was curious about this movie because I recently moved my mother into a Memory Care facility. The people and the facility portrayed in the film are nothing like where my mother is, sadly. Everyone at my mother's place is way too old and feeble to get into the kind of trouble these characters do in the movie.The dramedy is definitely targeted to Baby Boomers and beyond, but I still got a kick out of it. It's great to have some movies that appeal to older audiences.THINGS I LIKED:
It's great to see Ellen Burstyn. In real life, she's 88 years old. What a smile and twinkle she still has.Fun fact: Three of the leading ladies play a character whose name is very close to her own: Ellen Burstyn plays ""Helen""; Ann-Margret plays ""Margot"" and Jane Curtin plays ""Janet."" It didn't seem possible to me that SNL star Jane Curtin would be old enough to even be in a retirement home, so I had to look up her age; she's only 73 years old. The older I get, the younger that sounds!The movie opens with delightful, chipper music which continues throughout.The vintage cast also includes Loretta Devine, Christopher Lloyd, James Caan, and French Stewart.You get to learn about some Filipino food from the comical massage therapist played by Alec Mapa.There are some very touching moments that'll get you teary-eyed.I laughed at all the walkers lining the church pews in one of the scenes. They should have actually played that up more in the film. Instead, all of the seniors are extremely mobile.The grandson, played by Matthew Barnes is the perfect grandson any grandma would ever wish for.I felt bad for Elizabeth Mitchell who had to play such a cranky daughter. I've always thought she was so pretty and usually has such a gentle demeanor.There's a little twist in the story, but I don't want to spoil it for you...
There is some cute humor.Keep watching during the rolling credits for some very sweet pictures of couples who married later in life.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
If you're over 50 years old, you'll remember these stars in their hey-dey, which makes it more fun to watch them in this. Younger viewers may be mildly entertained without knowing the actors, but this film will definitely appeal more to an older audience.It's super cheesy, but there's nothing wrong with cheesy, especially if you're old!It's a little heartbreaking to see some of our long-time favorites get old.The pacing changes throughout the film.There is some edginess at the beginning with sarcastic characters, but then syrup gets dripped all over the script and things are neatly tied up with a bow.Nobody really likes watching super old people kiss and talk about intimate relations.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Kids are definitely going to be bored.Some ""mild"" profanity
Two of the old women get high smoking a joint.Talk of a ""tata towel"" and the comment ""Keep 'em high, keep 'em dry."" Women will laugh and be able to relate but everyone else will be grossed out.l!"

So you make it following the directions and sit down to eat and something is just missing?That's Queen Bees. Given the list of very accomplished stars, the premise, the trailer, everything should work together really well. But it doesn't. In fact, it fails... just short of miserably.The Rom was cringeworthy. The Com was virtually non-existent. The plot twist was predictable from the very first line uttered by the character.So sad because the recipe looked so good."
tt8338076,6.0,This is a trifle of a movie whose storyline is very predictible.The to other woman (besides Burstyn) are just OK in theor replaceable roles.Jimmy Cahn who is a great actor seems way out of place and uncomfortable in this flick. He also may have back problems because he seems to be all hunched over and has ginormous shoulder pads in his shirts that look so weird.The one to watch is Ellen Burstyn. She's 88 years old and is clearly a fabulous actress. And I mean fabulous. She blows Meryl Streep out of the water. Three times over.It's a not so great movie who's only saving grace is Ellen.One criticism: Why did they have to add so much left wing politics in this flick? Arent we sick of politics? The story didnt need it.
tt8338076,6.0,"This is a pleasant movie mostly about older people, 70s and 80s, getting along with each other in a retirement community, sort of a ""final resting place."" It follows the general feel of a Hallmark-type movie, two single people are attracted to each other, they begin to get along great, something is revealed that splits them apart, then we watch to see how they will overcome the difficulty.Filmed in Atlanta, Burstyn plays a widow living in the long-time family home and very happy to stay there. However when she absentmindedly goes out at night to quickly dispose of some garbage, leaving food cooking, then locks herself out, the result is a kitchen fire that will require a few weeks to repair. She will stay at the retirement community for at most a month. On her first day she encounters the four ladies, Bridge Club members, known as the ""Queen Bees"" and not for flattering reasons. And, as additional problems develop back home, ends up staying more than the month she thought initially.My wife and I enjoyed it at home on DVD from our public library. The story is told in mostly very predictable directions but it is pleasant and it is filled with many favorite actors from the past 60 years. Including Ann-Margret who just turned 80."

Totally disappointed by Dialogues, Screen play and surprisingly direction too wasn't at par with what we have seen in past from Rajkumar Hirani film. The acting was all right but the cast wasn't looking punjbi at all. Srk - Tapsi big Zero in chemistry and coming on screen together as 2 Punjabis, better would be Shahid Kapoor or Daljit.Background score and music aren't that good either.

tt0163651,6.0,"""So high school boys everywhere only think about sex, huh?"" my Japanese wife turned to me and said about 20 minutes into ""American Pie."" She looked at me expectantly, as if she wanted to hear me say I was somehow different, above such base pursuits. I could tell she was mildly disappointed when I replied, ""Yeah, pretty much."" Eighteen-year-old boys' raging hormones is a truly universal theme.There have been four American Pie films to date, not counting the straight-to-video releases. The film notably struck a chord with teens when it was released in 1999. I remember sitting in art class and overhearing a popular and attractive senior girl condescending to an awkward and geeky freshman boy, ""You haven't seen 'American Pie'? The great American sex comedy?"" I still cringe when I remember that.If you haven't seen it, it is basically about four senior boys who make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate high school. They shrewdly determine prom is their last chance to get laid, and devote all their energy to getting a woman in bed at the after-prom party, to be held at the lake house of the cocky lacrosse player, Steve Stifler. The boys, particularly Jim, have a series of embarrassing mishaps along the way, one famously involving a warm apple pie.""American Pie"" set a new bar for teen comedies. Every teen comedy since has tried, and failed, to top the scene where Stifler unwittingly drinks a beer with a load of semen in it.Though ""American Pie"" is famous for its numerous gross-outs, the movie is good, and not just gross, because we come to identify with the characters, and the humor rises naturally from the situations. The scene where Stifler slips laxatives into Finch's mochaccino, causing him to make a desperate dash for the nearest toilet, is funny not because fart sounds are humorous, but because the film already established Finch's aversion for public restrooms.The Stifler character was especially believable. When Heather (Mena Suvari) asks out Oz (Chris Klein) in front of the lacrosse team, Stifler proceeds to make lewd gestures. Heather misinterprets this as Stifler making fun of her, when Stifler was really just trying to embarrass Oz. When I first saw the film at the age of 16, I thought, That's pretty much how high school boys act.The acting is serviceable. Eugene Levy, who plays Jim's dad, and Seann William Scott, who plays Stifler, are totally convincing in their roles. (Toward the end of the film, watch Stifler in the background check his beer before he takes a sip.) Others, however, give flat performances, especially in dramatic scenes. However, since these scenes take back seat to the comedy, and few of the jokes fall flat from the acting, the mediocre performances don't hurt the overall effectiveness of the film.Another criticism I have of the film is one that pretty much applies to all Hollywood films, and that is that the kids are too rich. You can usually tell who the poor kid is in a Hollywood movie because he's the one who's not driving a late-model car. His family will still live in a two-storey house. Every student in ""American Pie"" (except for Oz, the only one shown to have a job), lives like the richest kid at my high school.Overall, ""American Pie"" is an enjoyable comedy that will continue to be the standard against which all teen comedies will be judged. I recommend the unrated version. While scenes in most unrated or extended editions were cut from the theatrical releases for good reasons (i.e., they were tedious), the theatrical version of ""American Pie"" was really a sanitized version of the better, unrated version."
tt0163651,6.0,"It's the summer of 1999, I'm 13 and somehow myself and about eight friends get into our local two screen cinema one afternoon to see American Pie. 95 minutes and a lot of thrown popcorn later and we leave having seen the funniest film we think we'll ever see. Now it's 2012, I'm 26, I have a beard and I've gone back to watch the film that my 13 year old self fell in love with before watching the forth instalment of the franchise next month.Towards the end of the senior year at High School four friends; jock Oz (Chris Klein), awkward geek Jim (Jason Biggs), quirky Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and regular guy Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are struggling to lose their virginity before they each embark for college. Having seen classmates like loud mouth Stifler (Seann William Scott) have success on this front and after one party believing that even the dorkiest guy in the class Chuck 'Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) has lost his virginity, the four friends make a pact that they will help each other to get laid by Prom Night.When I first watched this in 1999 the idea of hearing teenagers talk about and engage in sex during a movie was still novel and outrageous to me. Some of the jokes and more graphic or gross scenes were hilarious and like nothing I'd ever seen before. Now, 13 years later after the likes of The Hangover which have pushed the crude and discussing acts even further, the film feels a bit tame. It's still pretty gross to see Stifler drink from that cup or for Jim to enjoy that pie but sensitivities and audiences have changed a lot in the last decade or so. Much of the humour I liked 13 years ago now feels immature and I suppose this is because it isn't fresh and also because I've grown up. The humour in The Hangover didn't appeal to me either and the trailer for Project X put me off completely. I wonder how funny someone born in 1999 would find this film now. I expect they would find it funnier that I. One character who still remains funny to me is Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy). His interactions with his son about sex are cringe worthy and embarrassing even today. He stole the film and the entire franchise.One thing that struck me this time round was how poor some of the acting was. Tara Reid is dreadful and Chris Klein even worse. Shannon Elizabeth's accent is ridiculous and the country she is supposed to be from didn't even exist in 1999! Another thing I noticed this time was how sweaty the whole cast looked. I'd never noticed it before but it looked like each actor had gone for a run immediately before reading their lines. I didn't particularly like the sentimentality towards the end and everything ended far too neatly but at least it wasn't a nasty or mean movie. I also really liked the film's soundtrack both in 1999 and now.Despite all its flaws I still have great affinity for this film. It reminded me of being in my teens, wearing the same overly baggy clothes and having the same overly gelled hair. The film has stayed with me all these years and in a way I wish I hadn't revisited it. It's like that video game that you loved as a kid and you see in a shop for £2. You take it home, dig out and dust down your old console and then realise five minutes in that times have changed. Sure, it was great when you were a kid but you're not anymore. It's best to put it back in the box and remember the good times you had as a kid.www.attheback.blogspot.com"

This is a story of online dating gone W-I-L-D in the early 2010s, and it felt incredibly difficult to take sides in this case, at least initially.. and I'll tell you why. For starters, the no-strings-attached guy was so quick to get back on the dating platform right after he'd been through a life-threatening situation that happened due to someone he met virtually. If it were me, I'd just delete the whole thing altogether and vanish from the digital space forever (..which is way easier to do than to deal with crazy stalkers for years). Also, the piece wants to keep you on edge, so the distancing feels somewhat intentional.The re-enactments, while giving you visual insights, go somewhat overboard in the latter acts of the piece, making them a tad too cinematic for my liking. I also began to wonder early on why one of the ""supposed"" victims wasn't extensively interviewed, but I got my answer as we moved into the second act. Thanks to a trio of ""good guys"", the real criminal is brought to justice in a fantastic instance of (ethical?) bait & wait. It also justified the presence of the real victim's mother, giving her the space to redeem her daughter's reputation. Happy for her.

I'll always scrub thru the initial 30-120 seconds as 85 percent of the time, it's material we'll see within the documentary proper, that's used as a teaser or preview (which is rediculous if we're already pressing play, although allow me to elucidate the criterium upon which Netflix considers a file viewed :TWO minutes, after which time they can count it as viewed in its entirety and it'll count later on for licensing or selling to another platform as well as the residuals and financial obligations for the artists involved etc), now I don't tell you this for any reason that applies to my review, just so you guys know to a) ffw thru spoilers and b) the metrics of the studios (which usually benefit themselves)As for the film, my first thought is, when did these documentaries begin with the gutteral horror film music the visceral chittering and grim violins and become so HEAVILY produced with this reek of entertainment over say, education or information? Sensationalized and imo, disrespectful and detrimental to those who remain, the collateral humanity that bears the pain of loss and the grief of a traumatic death - I don't know what it says about us that we keep making and consuming this content and albeit hypocritical I know, although I no longer will watch a film/series in which the criminal or accused, is allowed (and compensated) for thier anecdotes - but that's a personal choice of which, more and more I'm limiting what I expose myself to for better or worse, for noble or deluded reasons I don't know - Finally on the film itself, with documentaries it's so difficult to know what metrics to review or opine on, cause do u focus on the subject matter (which is the story the filmmaker chose to make, and is entirely subjective to them) or the technical merits of the film proper? In this case I'll focus on the latter - where I've already whinged about how over produced it is, I have to admit that it also lends a professional air to it so... Anyway that's my pair of pennies without continuing to ramblealthough I'd like to add, I would like you to bear in mind that these detectives are posing for and reinacting for this B role of them at work - this is very telling imo // also come on, this ultimately was obvious, the police did thier jobs in this instance and got lucky with evidence , not ""chess when the others playing checkers"" for the love of all the fish and apricots."
tt30852970,6.0,"Feels wrong to review and rate true crime stories and documentaries, but I mainly write these for myself to remember my thoughts after watching. The description makes it seem like a bit of love triangle gone wrong, which is vaguely correct but it's clearly a really distressing 'wrong place, wrong time' and incredibly unlucky for the victims involved. Liz is the unexpected suspect, who goes to great lengths such as burning her house down which subsequently kills her own pets, shooting herself and keying her own car, all to frame Dave's ex wife. She clearly was very methodical with the murder as the body wasn't discovered but her logic when trying to frame Amy (Dave's ex wife) walked right into the trap set by the honourable police department who spent countless hours by the sound of it making sure the justice was served in this case."
tt30852970,6.0,"Gave this a 6 rating for 2 reasons: First, had déjà vu as I believe I saw it on Dateline TV show previously, so the new release on Netflix timing could have been done sooner? Second, The documentary is told mainly from the victim Dave's point of view while there were other victims involved overall and am thinking maybe more could have been done to express the loss or feelings of the other victims in more detail; since the documentary was kind of short a few more minutes would have let the other victims have a little more closure on how they felt now that the real culprit has been caught and tried in the court of law. The victims mother, the victims children, the ex-wife, the ex-wife's children, other relatives, update from the detectives who had health issues and put off their healthcare to finish the case, etc.The documentary is a wake-up call to all though who form quick relationships - how well do you really know that person?"
tt30852970,6.0,"I have seen this case on Dazeline, and it is a haunting, cruel and heartbreaking case indeed. And I understand that stalking this guy and his ex-wife must be a horrifying situation. But in this documentary Dave Krupa presents himself as the super victim, but let's not forget that Cari Farver, her mother who lost a daughter and her son who lost a mother are the real victims here. And that sort of gets in the background. Dave Krupa should have known better than to let this monster of a woman into his life again and again. So - again - my heart goes out to Cari...and Dave Krupa - enjoy your fame."
tt30852970,5.0,"Aww....poor Dave. It interesting how these types of 'programs', whether it's a 30-min, or a 90-min project on any of the multitude of networks, the perspective and scope is the problem. I'm fascinated how the idea of 'very bad things happening to really good people' scenario can be spun into thousands of projects for propaganda, social programming purposes. It's all designed for exploitation of people, and to empower (socially, financially, etc) other interests in this culture (much like the justice system here in the U. S.). The prototype victims/villains and Heroes - yet, no legitimate insight into the dynamics of what, why, and how...it's just procedural, and then to print. This project is quite average, albeit well-crafted. Program - group-think - on to the next one."
tt0918940,6.0,Finally the background story of the legend Tarzan how all began. The special effects were well adapted but sometimes the pace of the scenes was slow.The end was great with full of action.It's a truly escape from our daily business into the jungle of Kongo. Give it a try. 6/10.
tt11628854,6.0,"This movie felt like another of Keira Knightley's films, ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,"" except it was much less funny. This film never made me laugh, or even smile. It has some awkward quirky moments where the writer attempts humor, but misses the mark.The basic premise is the government has announced that the world is ending, and they've handed out ""exit pills"" (suicide pills) to the population so that they don't needlessly suffer. Except for illegal aliens and the homeless. Because according to the film, ""they don't count."" Ironically, as you'll later find out, this might mean the meek shall indeed inherit the Earth.In the first act you find out that the end comes from an environmental disaster that has created a toxic cloud moving across the globe that kills people by liquifying their organs. They really don't even try to touch on the science about what caused it, but it is said in the dialogue that humanity has polluted the world to the point that ""the world spews it all back us."" To avoid an agonizing death, the government is actively promoting that everyone should take the exit pill.Old college friends gather at a country estate for one last Christmas party before the toxic clouds arrive, and they take their government-provided ""exit pills"" to avoid dying said horrible death. This part of the movie was a little like a millennial version of the 1983 movie ""The Big Chill."" Which also had old college friends from the boomer generation gather for a weekend reunion.There is an interracial lesbian couple, an interracial heterosexual couple, and two white heterosexual couples with kids, kids who drop a lot of F-bombs.The second act they all drink, dance, play games, reminisce and tell each other awkward and inappropriate secrets about their past. I sense that the writer wanted some of this to be funny but in my opinion really missed the mark.We learn that one of the characters is pregnant and doesn't want to take the pill because she doesn't want to kill her baby.One of the other couple's sons also doesn't want to take the pill because he wants to survive, and questions the government's narrative. This uncertainty regarding the narrative's validity is shared by several other characters. Maybe the government and scientists are lying, maybe they are just mistaken.At the start of the third act the son who proclaims he isn't going to take the pill runs off, he finds a car by the side of the road with a family in it that have all taken the exit pill and are dead. The boy begins to scream as one of the toxic dust devils blows in exposing him to the toxin. His father picks him up and takes him back to the house, where he announces it's time to take the pills. There are some more awkward quirky moments which follow.In the end, they all take the pill except the youngest son, who they believe is dead from exposure to the mysterious toxic cloud. He is unconscious and has bled from his eyes, nose, mouth and ears. .The final scene we see it is morning. The cloud is gone, and it's bright snowy morning. We then get a cinematic survey confirming that everyone has indeed committed suicide-even the young pregnant woman who didn't want to kill her unborn child finally gave in to her boyfriend's insistence that they ""go together."" The lesbian has stabbed to death her lover because her lover vomited up the exit pill, the scene shows them both dead on the kitchen floor.The final shot is on the face of the young boy who earlier we assumed had died and thus didn't take the pill. He opens his eyes. Confirming that he has survived. The government lied or was wrong. Then the credits roll.Filming for this movie wrapped before the COVID lockdowns. Which I think is a strange coincidence because it lightly touched on several themes that we're all dealing with today. Should you blindly trust the media and authorities?I'm not sure how I'd categorize this film. It's not a serious piece of fiction. It most certainly wasn't a comedy, and it wasn't much of a horror movie either. With that said, I kind of enjoyed it because of the actors."
tt11628854,5.0,"Not your traditional jolly holly Christmas fare in this movie as you might expect from the title, it started off like it was going to be Abigail's Christmas party but ended up in a much darker, post-apocalyptic place altogether.Matthew Goode and Keira Knightley are the couple living in a big country house with their three young foul-mouthed sons, into whose abode descends a motley crew of family and friends to on the face of it celebrate Christmas with them. After some initial thumbnail character sketches of all the participants coupled with some awkward attempts at humour and family tensions it seems as if we're in potential ""Love Actually"" territory but things aren't as they appear. Pretty soon, we discern that they are actually all gathering to carry out a mass suicide to prevent them dying a horrible agonising death from the gaseous fall-out blowing into every corner of the country, leaving no survivors as it goes.The government's considered response apparently is to issue everyone with a suicide pill to enable them to die in their own ordered way and not succumb to an otherwise painful, disfiguring death from the contagion. Before the end, the film has hit full ""And then there were none..."" mode although a slightly telegraphed, mildly shocking final scene sheds a new light on proceedings.I'm all for moving away from and indeed satirising ""Hallmark""-type cosy, unctuous seasonal features but this did seem a little too drastic in its intent. The different relationships and tensions between the partygoers are too lightly depicted, while the attempts at humour rarely hit the mark. Quite why the young children have to appear so obnoxious and speak so profanely I'm not sure, unless it was a thinly-veiled attack on the middle and upper classes where apparently it's cool for a parent to sit in alongside two of his teenage sons in a bath.In these continuing days of Covid and its devastating sweep across the planet and it seems Britain in particular, the film has something to say about how society faces a worldwide pandemic and similarly poses relevant questions about the right to die and assisted suicide. In the end though, as the swell of the moody synthesiser and orchestra grows ever louder, I found it difficult to relate to and sympathise with the plights of this extended, unappealing family. Overall for me the film lacked subtlety and failed to strike an appreciable balance between satirical humour and science-fiction horror.Still, it made for an alternative to the usual ""Deck The Halls"" / ""Christmas Vacation"" nonsense that normally gets served up at this time of year and is worth a watch for that reason alone."
tt11628854,5.0,The film tried so hard to become funny and creative but accomplishes neither. It got not a single chuckle for me.Pretty sad considering I had some good actors and actresses on board.
tt11628854,6.0,"I'm not really sure this film knows what it wants to be. If you want to watch a good film about adults and children facing the end check out 'These Final Hours'. If you want to watch a black comedy about the end of the world try Dr Strangelove. There is a lot of talent on screen but much of the script is nonsense and the characters are both sympathetic and unlikeable - but not in a good way. Roman Griffin Davis was pretty good, but the script was obviously distorted to feature everything he says and does. Nothing felt natural and most of the character's motivations remain a mystery. By the end you don't care how it ends."
tt11628854,6.0,"""Silent Night"" will keep you watching till the end, hoping for a twist that might not come? This movie is difficult to place as the story is straightforward and there are no twists. Maybe a small one in the last five seconds. A giant toxic cloud caused by environmental abuse is forecast to sweep in on Boxing Day killing everyone, so this is the last party. But no worries as the entire group have their government-issued suicide pills! Excellent acting performances from the entire cast and outstanding acting from Keira Knightley and Griffin Davis (Jojo Rabbit). This is satire that only can be made in the UK. But there is something undeniably astonishing and inexplicable about seeing the end of the world. And maybe there is more truth in this story then we can imagine. This movie is so bizarre you have to see it."
tt14846026,5.0,"First off, let me say that the cinematography in this movie is sick. The effects were amazing. It's bloody, it's unapologetically violent. But unfortunately that's all there is to it.If you want to enjoy this movie, switch off your brains because it will insult your intelligence. The problem with such movies is that, even though it's a fictional story, they paint a picture of realness but fail to develop actual real scenarios.The reason why movies like James Bond, Equalizer, Borne, Mission Impossible and even John Wick, to an extent, work, is because the directors created scenes which where very much believable. This movie was unbelievable from the very beginning.All the three soldiers had to do was point and shoot which they didn't do. I don't know why they chose to fight instead. Then you had the landmine scene which was laughable. How does a horse get blow up and the rider, not a scratch? Then you have several soldiers firing randomly in one direction and they completely missed you and you didn't step on any landmine? Then you had the sniper who misses every single shot and even when using the heavy gun, he seem to get the dead guy being carried by the man, but when the dead guy is dropped, he can't get the guy himself? And you mean to tell me that the guys walking behind the trucks, couldn't see him rolling on the floor? They didn't see him kill the soldiers, enter the truck and hand over guns to the women? If there's gasoline, you check the gas tanks, no? And when they finally caught him, they hung him? Someone who could hold his breath under water for hours?! You decide not to shoot him?! And theeeeeeeennnn when you thought it couldn't get worse, he hits a MOVING plane with an axe, held onto it for it for a lift off and still managed to release the axe, pierce an armored plane with it whilst in mid air, enters the plane in time before the villain could get to him. And when the villain finally got to him and beat him to a pulp, he forgot he has a gun he can use to kill him, but rather, chose to use a rope?! Absolutely Ridiculous. And the last insult was when the plane crashes headfirst, minutes later man gets out holding his axe, unhurt, unscratched, eyes still white as snow, he rides to the bank with his gold and demands for cash.NONSENSE!"
tt14846026,5.0,"After watching the trailer more than once, I was so anticipating the torrent to download Sisu in HD to enjoy on my 80in 4k big screen. But after watching it, all I can say is that this was just a predictable one man army killer going up against a group of Nazis who were after his gold find, with dirt covered on faces, hiding that they were probably just a bunch pretty boy models who can't act giving them a more authentic solider look. Overall the story was watchable. The women who the Nazis had captured added a nice touch of fight back but the story was void of any real premise. For me this was ok popcorn and nothing more. The kill scenes were voilent brutal and extremely graphic but the story was meh at best. Watch once and call it day."
tt14846026,5.0,"If you go into this movie thinking it's going to be a realistic portrayal of a World War II hero, you will quickly be relieved of that notion. Sisu is an over the top Nazi killing gorefest that will appeal to the John Wick audiences of the world. The fight scenes leave a little bit to be desired, and the realism (without giving too much away) made many of us, myself included, laugh out loud in the theater.Don't expect more than what you think this movie is going to be based on watching the trailer. It's an acquired taste this 90 minutes of low budget cinema.All that being said, it's hard not to root for this warrior as he takes on despicable antagonists using what can only be described as the world's strongest pickaxe.Verdict: Watch."
tt19864802,6.0,"Someone should have warned them 'Land of Bad' is a marketing disaster as a title for a movie. There is no way I'm going to remember the movie by this title.'Land of Bad' offers nothing original. We've seen this premise so many times before and chances are you're going to watch it for the action and not so much the story. A Delta Force team is sent to the Philippines to extract a CIA agent (whom we never get to see). Kinney (Liam Hemsworth) - also known as Playboy - is mistakenly assigned to the operation, and - as predicted - becomes the protagonist.When the extraction goes horribly wrong, the team relies on drone operator 'Reaper' (Russell Crowe) to be their eyes and guide them to safety. 'Land of Bad' is a no-holds-barred actioner with action and adventure from beginning to end. There are a few very good action sequences and even well crafted suspense. I do think the film's final moments could have been better, but in general I rather enjoyed 'Land of Bad' - even if just for the action and to see those ripped bodies in action."
tt19864802,6.0,"Not as bad as I feared. There is absolutely no nitty-gritty feel to it. Nothing dark or foreboding. Nothing really suspenseful. No, it floats gently on the surface, fairly nice, controlled and polished. But on the other hand it is mostly fairly realistic and surprisingly gory. The enemies cannot aim if their lives depended on it (which it actually does, making it even more surprising that they cannot aim) and hand grenades has huge explosions, tearing down walls and stuff. But overall fairly realistic, still.So yeah, I would give it a 6.5. Absolutely not a 7 and since 6.5 does not exist I am forced to give it a 6."
tt19864802,6.0,"A fairly decent and engaging action movie, with enough gunfire and explosions to satisfy most action fans. Russell Crowe does a good job here, although he's really too old and overweight to accurately portray a US Air Force Captain. The female SSgt who works beside him seems confused about her branch of service as her tape reads ""US AIR FORCE"" but her rank insignia is that of a US Army Staff Sergeant. Also, Hellfire missiles are rail launched, not eject launched.Nitpicks aside, I'd call it entertaining. The actors playing the Special Ops soldiers seem convincing, and look quite fit for their roles.Check it out."
tt19864802,5.0,"When the film gets its action blocks going, you forget what the core mission was. If it were a videogame, you could always press the Esc button to be reminded of it. But given it's a film where you have two protagonists (one on the field, one piloting a drone), the writers David Frigerio and William Eubank (who's directing) have their task cut out for them. We've already seen similar setups in Lone Survivor, Body of Lies (which also had Russell Crowe), and more. A lot was riding on two things here: a) the camaraderie between the characters played by Crowe and Liam Hemsworth, and b) the set pieces.Eubank handles the action quite ably. The firing of bullets and the drone strikes (and subsequent explosions) look dazzling in slow motion. Since character development is fairly on the lower side, they add random scenes of Crowe's character going vegan grocery shopping for his pregnant wife. The decision to intercut this with Hemsworth's character getting physically tortured by the antagonist was puzzling. The tones were completely distinct and the casual nature of one completely deflated the seriousness of the other. We've seen Hemsworth in similar (rookie) roles, and he's functional here. Crowe seems to be enjoying his nearly 60s phase, not caring much about his ballooning physique.Land of Bad is ultimately a ""watch-and-forget"" kind of action thriller that doesn't push your buttons. That has mostly been the deal with all of William Eubank's filmography. Still, it's better than the last Paranormal Activity flick he made."
tt8338762,6.0,"It's the 80's. Ambitious commodities trader Rory O'Hara (Jude Law) returns to London taking his wife Allison (Carrie Coon) and their two kids. He is pushing for a big deal with a big payout. He is spending beyond his means and moves the family again to a country mansion. It causes friction with his wife and exacerbating their money trouble.I like the idea of this family descending into dysfunction. I find a lot of it very compelling. Law and Coon are delivering intriguing performances. Filmmaker Sean Durkin, who made Martha Marcy May Marlene, is trying to give this film a quiet, naturalistic feel. It does need to be a bit clearer with the beginning. It's just too slow until the money troubles begin. That really raises the intensity and the movie picks up steam. Quite frankly, the start bored me to the point of passing out and I had to start over again. The passive filmmaking style is not conducive to paying attention."
tt8338762,6.0,"Nicely played and it does have some interesting themes but it never makes the most of them, feeling dramatically inert for long periods. All of the tense scenes are in the trailer, the rest is a rather humdrum, if never quite boring, collection of family scenes. Saved from being a 5 by the final few reels."
tt11138512,6.0,"Well, the movie's cover/poster definitely was interesting enough to catch my attention. And I figured that with the movie's 7.8 rating on IMDb, in this writing moment, then I would be in for something grand here.And I will admit that I was excited to see what writers Sjón and Robert Eggers had in store for me here with the 2 hours and 17 minutes that the movie ran for.However, I must say that while ""The Northman"" was watchable, it was ultimately just another run-of-the-mill Viking-inspired movie, for better or worse. Sure, it was a watchable movie and entertaining enough for what it was. But don't get your hopes up for this one. If you've seen other Viking movies, or TV series for that matter, then you already know what you are in for here. Yeah, director Robert Eggers didn't deviate much from the how-to-make-a-Viking-saga-movie blueprint.Visually then ""The Northman"" was interesting, as it definitely felt like an era-appropriate movie. I did like the props, costumes, sets, scenery, etc., because it definitely looked and felt like what is usually associated with the Vikings era.""The Northman"" has a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke and even Willem Dafoe. All great talents, sure, but some of them do raise a wondering sensation as to why they were cast for a Viking movie. But on the other hand, I will say that casting Icelandic singer Björk for the movie, despite being a minor role and appearance, was just phenomenal.Something that didn't sit well with me in ""The Northman"", was the fact that it was English language based. Sure, I understand that from a wider appeal to the audience approach. But it just feels wrong having Vikings speak English, it just takes away from the atmosphere and the believability. And also the supernatural aspects were somewhat baffling to me. Sure, I understand that the Valkyries are a part of Norse lore, but having a pale woman with retainers on her teeth screaming and sitting on a flying horse just doesn't really work.I was expecting more than just your average generic Viking movie from director Robert Eggers, and I was somewhat disappointed when the movie just turned out to be a run-of-the-mill Viking movie. It could and should have been so much more, especially for a production of this magnitude.While ""The Northman"" is watchable and entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, then this is hardly a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.My rating of ""The Northman"" lands on a six out of ten stars. It is the atmosphere, the brutality in the movie, and some of the performances that managed to snag the rating up from five to a six star rating for me."
tt11138512,5.0,"I won't waste too much time with this one. If you've had the misfortune to watch the recent movie ""The Green Knight"" then be prepared for more of the same pseudo art-house nonsense here.Coming from ""visionary"" director Robert Eggers (if you ask me, he's had one too many ""visions"") this is a dull, tedious slog. Now, as my title suggests, it seems inconceivable (yes I do know what that word means!) that putting vikings and a tale of vengeance together could be such a dud, but here it is.The Northman manages to take a story that should easily fit in the old 90 minute movie bracket and pad it out to nearly two and a quarter hours. The padding comes in the form of trippy daydreams/hallucinations by the main character as he suffers to satisfy his vengeance. Yeah, you'll want to skip those if you can.I've only given this as many points as I have because at least there was a small twist in the story, albeit a blindingly obvious one to do with the ""hero's"" mother. That, and the ending which...lets just say it isn't surprising given the story. That lack of surprise ending will still leave you with that sinking feeling. A feeling that you've just wasted two hours of your life on what amounts to an episode of Vikings that was discarded in the writer's room.SUMMARY: Going to Iceland (the store) is less tedious and frustrating than going to Iceland (the place) in this movie. Too much ""visionary"" and not enough ""entertaining"" in this one. Skip it, watch Vikings again, or Conan, or 13th Warrior or Outlander (2008). All are much, much more fun."
tt11138512,6.0,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Anything novel and not Marvel. But, unfortunately, this movie was dark, slow and not engaging. It started off with the harsh power of humanity to endure hardship and to impose it, but then went flat with the story. Nothing to learn, no one to love or hate, nothing to make you a character. Not intending the ultimate insult, but perhaps it is: you never forget you're watching a movie. You don't become one with it. However, it could win an Academy award for the production or costumes, but none of that makes up for a dark, slow and non-engaging story."
tt11138512,5.0,"This might be an unpopular one, but I guess I have to speak the truth as I found it - which was that I was hoping ""The Northman"" would be a crazy, wild and brutal Viking adventure - which in some elements it is, but it's also a lyrical, arthouse-style, loose adaptation of Amleth, that perhaps caught me in the wrong mood to truly appreciate.King Aruvandil (Ethan Hawke) is a Viking King, who is murdered by his brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang) who takes his Estate and his Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Fjolnir fails to kill his son, Amleth (Oscar Novak/Alexander Skarsgard) though, who swears revenge as a child and after years killing and pillaging with an adopted clan, learns that Fjolnir has moved to Iceland. Infiltrating the household as a slave, Amelth joins forces with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) another slave in the house and his long-awaited vengeance begins.I can see why people liked it. It's beautiful to look at, shot in practical locations and using CGI to enhance the scenes when required, such as the epic volcano that looms over Iceland throughout the film and features in the ending. The fight scenes are generally well done, though I don't necessarily think that they were as gory as I hoped, or as others seem to have found them. Skarsgard's performance was good, though if I'm honest I'm not sure that any of the rest of the cast (perhaps with the exception of Claes Bang) really fit the roles they were playing. . . These are all actors I like in other things, but personally felt like they were miscast here.Again, I really do feel like on another day, or perhaps at home rather than at the cinema I might have enjoyed the film more, but it felt long, and I didn't care for the times when the film took its more artistic flights of fancy. The film I'd compare it too is ""The Green Knight"", which is similar in terms of tone and use of fantasy elements, though obviously with a different cultural mythology.It's not often that I feel like the problem with a film I haven't enjoyed might be me, rather than the film - but ""The Northman"" feels like a film that's going to divide it's audience and, this time, I'm not sold."
tt11138512,5.0,"The Northman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows the son of a king whose father is murdered leading to him having to flee the kingdom leaving his mother behind. He spends his life building his strength, vision and understanding of his fate so he can obtain revenge and save his mother.This movie is directed by Robert Eggers (The Lighthouse) and stars Alexander Skarsgård (True Blood), Nicole Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut), Ethan Hawke (Training Day), Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man), Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch) and Claes Bang (The Square).This was a very uneven movie with an incredibly predictable storyline. You literally know every single thing that is going to happen in the first 15 minutes. There's also some painfully unrealistic scenes like how the child escapes after his father is murdered. The editing could have been much better and the film definitely didn't need to be 2 hours and 15 minutes. The script also could have been better written. The cinematography was tremendous, the action scenes were fantastic, the settings and attire perfect and the cast was well selected.Overall this is a very uneven movie that required better editing, contains mediocre writing, a predictable storyline but entertaining action sequences. I would score this a 5/10 and recommend seeing it once."
tt11138512,5.0,"I was looking forward to ""The Northman"" due to a variety of different reasons.... or, if I'm being honest, just one: Anya Taylor-Joy. The talented, gorgeous seductress she is, once I learned that she would play a starring role in this film, I knew I had to see it on the largest screen possible. Unfortunately, the theatre I went to had an unfortunately small screen that certainly detracted from my viewing experience; maybe this was a strategic move, however, on the part of the studio, as now I will be going to see this movie again at a different cinema, preferably one with a bigger silver screen. And as I am so willing to go pay to see this movie again, surely I must have loved it.... right? Wrong - and don't call me Shirley.""The Northman"" is no doubt overhyped. Directed by Robert Eggers, who has made ""The Witch"" (which I adore) and ""The Lighthouse"" (which I haven't yet seen), ""The Northman"" is his third feature, one that was making a name for itself before it was even released due to how well-received his previous two movies were. In all honesty, it seems like people were ready to love this without even having seen it yet, and I believe that, because of this excitement, people (critics included) are having a difficult time looking at this movie objectively - because with all there is to appreciate, there is also an equal amount to criticize.Anya Taylor-Joy is perfection, as always - she's not just beautiful, but she is proving her range as an actress in each and every role she chooses. Yes, she may have been my reason for buying a ticket to this, but I was equally as impressed with virtually everyone in here. Alexander Skarsgård is one of my favorite actors, and he was very effective as a monstrous brooding brute. Ethan Hawke and Nicole Kidman also do well with what they have; in short, the acting is good - that is, when the script allows it to be. Because, even though the actors and actresses are clearly committed to their parts, the script is full of borderline embarrassing dialogue. Conversations have no substance to them, with people speaking as if they've never spoken before. Many lines are simplistic to the extreme, almost as if they were written by a mediocre fan fiction writer. You can almost look past it due to the clear competence of the performers, but my near constant eye rolls had me wishing for a better screenplay.If you've seen the trailer for this, you already know the movie looks incredible - and it does. My eyes were constantly glued to the screen, soaking up the scenery. Similarly, my ears found themselves honed in on the soundtrack; basically a star in and of itself, the score here booms through the theatre sound systems. Ominous and engrossing, the soundtrack is nearly constant, seeping everything in a sense of horror and unease - and it's effective (and so loud that, even if you find yourself bored, you won't be able to fall asleep). Visually and audibly, ""The Northman"" is 100% worth the price of admission. From a plot and story perspective, however, you'll find it lacking.""The Northman"" has a simplistic story - perhaps too simplistic for its own good. Following a young Viking prince on his quest to avenge his father's murder, you'd think that Eggers would have something unique up his sleeve. I assumed that he'd either fill this movie with great action and have this be his entry into blockbuster filmmaking, or if not that, at the least attempt to throw a wrench in what is otherwise a traditional revenge movie. Alas, he does neither! ""The Northman"" does not have enough action to qualify as a satisfying action movie (granted, the action is filmed well, but is surprisingly tame and not as bloody as I expected or wanted) nor does it have enough plot twists to switch things up from average revenge fare. The movie meanders, barely picking up any steam except for the occasional burst of violence. You'll spend a lot of time watching characters engage in uninteresting conversations that could've been interesting with better dialogue. You'll see psychedelic dream sequences that are unique the first time, and then quickly overplayed by the second, third, fourth, and fifth time. The story lacks focus; so sure, while you'll see a visual feast of Norse culture that never really leads anywhere, you'll also find yourself asking whether you're watching a revenge movie or a historically accurate portrayal of 900 A. D. life.In many ways ""The Northman"" delivers. It's great to look at (and not just because of Anya Taylor-Joy), with truly immersive world building that draws viewers in with overwhelming sights and sounds. This is a brutal film, one that's not afraid to show Norse culture as it was. This is also a film that has a shocking lack of direction. While I would never say I was bored or disengaged, I can say I found myself slightly confused at the way the movie plodded along; for a movie that's over two hours, not much happens, and when things do happen, it isn't very interesting. I was disappointed in ""The Northman,"" but even so, cannot deny the quality of its technical aspects - I only wish that quality carried over in the storytelling."
tt11138512,5.0,"While they definitely aren't for all tastes, I was blown away by the originality and singular visions of ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse,"" even if they still are so specific that I still had my criticisms of them. As a result, I was hoping for this to be a truly unique and memorable cinematic experience. Unfortunately, it looks and sounds incredible but otherwise ended up being a letdown in my book. It's certainly Eggers' weakest film yet, which is disappointing.The film centers on a Viking whose father is killed by his uncle when he is very young. Decades later, he is a berserker raiding villages who ends up plotting a bloody plot for vengeance. Shot on location in Iceland, the film's cinematography is often beautiful, with expansive and wide shots. The film's score is also stirring and authentic. Everything looks and sounds incredible in a Dolby Cinema screen, accentuated by Eggers' precise attention to historical accuracy that we see throughout his films. Tragically, though, these technical qualities are about where the strengths of the film end. Unlike ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse,"" this film feels oddly derivative. The story feels like a recycled revenge plot, and the brutal Viking action doesn't feel like something we haven't seen before. While those two other films generally lacked plots in a conventional sense, people who enjoyed them could successfully argue that they made up for such a lack of plot in clear vision. They were uniquely atmospheric and created pitch-perfect senses of suspense and dread, accentuated by the period detail and aesthetics. Unfortunately, ""The Northman"" just doesn't feel as atmospheric or tonally unique. This might in part be caused by the fact that it has a much bigger budget than those other two films, but it also means that I feel the film dragged on a bit longer than it should have. You can have a unique plot and/or an engaging atmosphere. Some films have one of these elements, and some have both. But unfortunately, I feel like the derivativeness of the plot and the sometimes-choppy editing and pacing ended up getting the better of it. In ""The Lighthouse"" and ""The Witch,"" you felt genuine psychological peril that could make you appreciate the comparatively low-but-serious stakes of the characters. The same cannot be said here. All of the violent Viking action is plentiful, but it gets very predictable and repetitive, and simply just doesn't feel as impactful or soulful as genuine psychological suspense and taut narrative creativity. Sadly, I don't recommend this one. 5/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. The picture and sound quality were excellent."
tt11138512,5.0,"If the boats were very long then this is longer, but longevity doesn't make it any stronger, the accents are a grind, claustrophobic and confined, left feeling peeled, pillaged, plundered, and without wonder."
tt19887550,6.0,"Definitely fits into the underwhelming category based on the well known writing capability of Dan Levy. I liked the concept, but don't think it delivered. The opening segment was anticlimactic and didn't illicit the expected empathy, it was almost like ""okay... now what"". And the now what, was three self obsessed people pretending to be friends and having mostly meaningless conversations. The characters were all for the most part unlikeable, and therefore it didn't matter to me if they got ""happy endings"" and dealt with their hangups. Overall, okay, no depth to characters or story. I feel no need to ever watch again."
tt19887550,5.0,"I saw the trailer for this movie on Netflix, and it was much anticipated on my end. Although Dan has always done comedy, I wanted to give him a chance to express his artistic brush to the category of drama. Sadly, it just did not work. The script seemed to have had potential, and I think with some adjustments to the script, and definitely to the casting, this would have have been phenomenal. It just fell flat. Dan was just not believable as a grieving husband navigating life. His friends were unbelievable and curiously cast. Honestly, I think Himesh Patel (great acting) would've done better in the main role and Dan as the friend. Ruth Negga's character was so over acted and so over the top, that I believe she was one of the primary reasons I did not like this movie. It was as if she was taking high school drama 101. She was distracting. Perhaps she was just trying to work with a really bad script. This category of movie, in my opinion, is at the top of all the genres that are available, and it's so rare that Netflix will put out a good movie in that category, so I really wanted this to work.OK some of the things that did work was the music. The music was impeccable. The aesthetic of the movie was amazing. I like the clothing, I liked the apartments, I liked the art gallery, Etc. That was beautiful. And I think if it was different actors with a slightly adjusted script, it may have evoked a tear from me. I wanted to feel sad, I wanted to feel pain, I wanted to feel a sense of something, but no. I just stared at the screen with disappointment.Dan Levy is an amazing actor in the comedy genre. I don't like to box someone in the category, but I would like to see him try again, but with some adjustments. We need people like him, creative and brilliant. And I know he wanted to break out of the comedy genre, and I respect that, but this was not his crowning glory."
tt19887550,6.0,"In Good Grief, Dan Levy creates a morose take on the rom-com, dealing head-on with the different ways grief affects people. The idea is strong in that it's different, and maybe even innovative, to try to place grief at the center of a film like this--but it would have taken a more deft hand and a little more digging to make this work. I think Levy might have served himself better had he chosen someone else to play the lead. Then he could have given that actor more challenging scenes to work with, maybe even had him struggle with sorrow and loss. Instead, the film comes off as the story of a pampered man who seems to lack depth. There needed to be more of an idea than: three friends go to Paris with what seems like an endless expense account to shake off the blues.Passion is the yin to grief's yang--and this film lacks passion. We sense no real sparks between Levy and Evans early in the film, and even less when he mets the French Theo in Paris. When we see two actors
kissing passionately, we need to feel the heat, feel that they can barely control themselves in the moment. Levy does not seem up to it and that affects the whole film. His sadness is more like that of a person who didn't get the table he wanted in a tony restaurant.There was a better film hiding in here."
tt19887550,5.0,"At best, the movie was average. The narrative is somewhat heartbreaking but never reaches a high degree of intrigue. I had the impression that I was constantly waiting for the big reveal, the big twist, or the moment that would pique my curiosity, but it never materialized.From the protagonist's lover's death until the revelation of the unidentified affair, there were opportunities to set up the film, but it failed to elicit the necessary emotions. I'm not sure if this makes the film more realistic than other films where I found the characters were more sympathetic and relatable. All the movie did for me, though, was make itself seem dull."
tt19887550,6.0,"Dan Levy steps behind the cameras for a solemn yet ardent look at grief and unexpected loss. Levy goes slightly against his ""Schitt's Creek""-persona to try and convey an emotional and sincere character study and despite a rocky start the film finds its groove and gets quite moving particularly in the third act. Solid directing, lush cinematography showing a glorious Paris at Christmas. Still, quite a bit of the premise and writing is pretentious, unrelatable and unrealistic - can we ever get a film like this where the characters have regular jobs? Levy is sturdy in the lead, Himesh Patel is quite good but appears stuck in a different film whilst Ruth Negga is grating to say the least - her character is already in contention for one of the worst in 2024. She comes close to ruining the movie with her vain, selfish and unlikable character. Solid debut!"
tt19887550,6.0,"Muted to a fault, Good Grief gets a lot of points for offering a mature look at the struggle to move on from a heartbreaking tragedy. However, it feels like that same level of restraint hinders the film almost as much as it helps, preventing it from truly being the emotionally resonant story that's in here somewhere.Dan Levy gives a good lead performance that definitely doesn't feel showy or excessively vain which is nice. Similar to everything else though, it does feel like he's holding back a little too much. On the other hand, Ruth Negga and Himesh Patel are really good at maintaining that restraint whilst still having grander moments where they can let everything out.The greatest strengths of Dan Levy's direction lies in the strong opening and how it can further emphasise his character's grief through the slow pace and clinical visual style. It doesn't really look like a film but regardless of that it can still look gorgeous, helped by being set exclusively in Paris and London."
tt19887550,6.0,"The directing is quite good, image and general aesthetic are qualitative, acting decent, the dialogues bring at time some sort of accuracy; I liked the promise behind the synopsis and what the letter brings.However it doesn't deliver properly, I have not been fully satisfied with any of the aspects of the development, of the characters. Even though it sometimes felt right, the whole thing was a bit tasteless, seen before and didn't drag me into the story.It's as shame, as many ingredients were there to make a good movie, but it is just average and a bit cringy at times. I liked that the romance was treated as a normal romance rather than gay stereotypes, but I would have enjoyed a better development. The secondary characters aren't especially likable, and some moments or conversations just didn't felt right.I don't know if it should have been spiced up a bit or just more focused but the result wasn't pleasant enough to want me to watch it again sometimes. I like movies about grief and overcoming it, but they should also uplift and bring some more feel-good to finish it with satisfaction."
tt19887550,5.0,"Good Grief is not a ""bad"" movie by any means. It has great production values to support a great idea of a movie. The issue here, at least for me, is that I found it ultimately disappointing, and at times affected and then a tiny little bit Hallmark-y. It has its good moments, but sometimes it just doesn't fly from here to there. The way some of the characters speak, sometimes in broad generalisations trying somehow desperately to make us, the audience, feel the intended feeling is a big drawback, it pushes me away from everything that is happening in the movie. Some speeches feel overlong, indeed. I must say that I specially loved Ruth, Himesh and Arnaud, both actors and characters.Given the pedigree involved I expected it to be a little bit better than just OK or merely watchable. I look forward to Dan next project.And perhaps that was the problem for me: my own expectations about the whole thing."
tt19887550,5.0,"Not a bad effort from star writer director Levy, but first timer mistakes keep it from really taking off. It's also all rather mild in all regards, be it as romance or drama or semi tragedy or comedy it dabbles in all these to not very exciting funny or moving ends. All the characters tend to speak alike and the performances are also of the soft-just above a whisper variety that make you want to shake them and ask them to speak up at times.The title is kind of funny, with it's Charlie Brown allusions. It's no spoiler to say the film is about Levy's character dying at the start and how this effects his husband and his husbands friends.It's really about this group of friends, two gay men, former lovers, and their gal pal a sort of actress. They are all seemingly very well off finacially which makes this a sort of mild neurotic problems of the upper class story, how bad can you feel as they all wear expensive clothing and hang out in the beautiful locations beautifully decorated. The story sets up possible financial issues for Levy's character but these are dropped. You really kind of feel not much is at stake, Levy's character is kind of sad, never seems on the verge of collapse though, nor does he display much bitter wit--aside from one very funny line.It feels like a pretty good first draft of a script, there is one good twist early on that doesn't really go anywhere after that, you wish some real bitter comedy or real soul shattering grief might errupt but never does. Levy is a talented performer getting to make his his movie here, but as a filmmaker and feature length writer he shows his lack of experience and a lack of being able to look at the material from an audience point of view. The valid points the film does make about grief and friendship tend to just get repeated over and over again in the dialogue. It's pretty much all talk actually, the two kind of dramatic scenes happen off screen. One nice ""date scene"" at an art gallery is an exception.Visually it's all smooth and pretty looking, the only thing that stands out is Levy's glasses, often they glow in an otherwise dark scene, this happens over and over again, is this to highlight his eyes, it tends to take away from the expression in them actually, it seems like either just a choice or a try at something that doesn't totally work.Location work in Paris and London are beautiful, music score doesn't add much life toany of it. The fact that the film could probably be exactly the same with a male and female married couple rather and a gay couple sort of points to the generic polite middle of the quiet road the film remains on all the way through.Also as a first time director and writer Levy's influences show, most of them being from Woody Allen, perhaps mostly Annie Hall which is far superior."
tt19887550,5.0,"Where is the Dan Levy I know from Schitt's Creek?! Because based on this movie, which he wrote, directed, and starred in, I see a completely different storyteller. And not really for the better. Good Grief is an overwritten, yet authentic debut film that tries so hard to say something, to make you feel something, that it ends up doing neither. Instead, it felt very surface level, as in it told us what the characters were feeling rather than showing us, making it nearly impossible to emotionally connect to the material. I love Dan Levy and what he did with Schitt's Creek... but this just felt like it was a vanity project for him. I felt like he took on more than he could chew here, and his inexperience won out. You can tell he is trying too hard to make it all work, but unfortunately, the film is just missing something. The gaping hole sitting at the heart of Dan Levy's directorial debut film is hard to pinpoint exactly, but if I had to put a finger near that button, I'd say that for a film about grief, even with ""grief"" in its title, the film talks about grief - the idea of it and the emotions surrounding it - much more so than letting us in and feel said (titular) grief. Once again, I never really ""felt"" anything. Levy and his wonderful cast, his sharp, smart writing, and the warm interior designs and artwork featured make this more than amenable as a sorta bougie, sorta indie Netflix exercise, but the film can't seem to wear its heart on its sleeve like it desperately wants to and therefore keeps us at arm's length the entire time. It pains me that this film is somewhat hollow because I love Dan Levy and he deserves all the success life, the universe, and everything can give him, but this film is unfortunately a bit of a stagnant step forward in hopefully what will be a successful directorial career for him."
tt1937390,6.0,"One story, apparently divided into 2 as the whole thing is just shy of 4 hours long. Seligman, played by Stellan Skarsgard, finds a badly beaten woman - Joe, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, and takes her home where she recounts in 8 segments across the 2 parts how sex has completely taken over upon every aspect of her life.Whilst there is a lot of explicit sex / images covering different aspects of sex and how they have have featured in and shaped Joe's life, this is not remotely an art house porn movie. Instead it is never less than engrossing, beautifully filmed and a generally quite sad insight into an addiction. Certainly there are some quite shocking scenes, some of which are perhaps rather hard to fully understand, but the controversial, often brilliant and sometimes crass Von Trier does a great job here and the drama and the set pieces are all convincingly played out - the scene where the young boy leaves his cot is terrific. My only minor concern is with the characters generally - the actors, especially Gainsbough give their all here to be sure, but they're all the same and frankly all seem stoned.An extended edition featuring even more explicit material running at 5 and a half hours exists - not sure I could take that. I was impressed by the film(s) but it's not a lot of laughs."
tt14537248,6.0,"I frequently despise movies that are entirely dialogue-based, where nothing really happens aside from the conversations. But with Nefarious, I was locked in on that dialogue from beginning to end.This was partly accomplished with good writing. The conversations are interesting and seem strategic by the characters. But the biggest reason it works is the performance by Sean Patrick Flanery. The entire success of this movie rides on him.He knocks it out of the park. His performance is so good, so convincing. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. As I wondered why this talent hasn't launched him to bigger roles, I went back and looked at his history. I've only seen him in Dexter and Saw VII (aka Saw 3D). I have no idea how he hasn't earned bigger roles. The only reasonable explanation would be that he just recently developed this level of skill, which is possible but hard to believe.I enjoyed Nefarious overall, despite most of the movie being very slow. But I did wish there was a little more that would push it past the threshold of being a great movie that I would want to rewatch. I also think the listed genres of horror and thriller are highly misleading. It's neither. If I had to choose, I would describe it as a creepy drama.(1 viewing, opening Thursday 4/13/2023)"

The only grace was seeing Ryan Gosling on screen. A big budget film with neither strong screenplay nor efficient set up, The Gray Man feels like a sunk ship with lots of efforts vanishing in vain.Aside from two hand-to-hand combat scenes, the fights are a dimly-lit mess of quick cuts and bullets flying, something similar to what Michael Bay has done all over these years.Being a big budget film, The Gray Man is a disappointment to a greater extent, considering that the project had A List actors, but a poor storyline.My Rating: 5/10."
tt1649418,5.0,"Rushing from place to place after opening with a colorful killing in Bangkok adds little to get us into the story.IMHO relying on Ryan Gosling and Ana de Armas proven star qualities fails to substitute a proper establishment of their characters in this movie. Of course as many others I wondered who took all the money Netflix paid for this production but as with so many other big productions today, it's not the point if CGI, actors or travel expenses of the crew were overpriced, the problem lies in the script. The art in script writing is to build up characters and a story. If you don't know why things happen, you don't care and all the surprises and zigzags of the plot loose a lot of their potential."

tt1649418,5.0,"Considering the huge budget, cast and previous talent of the filmmakers, the fact that The Gray Man is thoroughly average is extremely disappointing. An action thriller that does nothing new and doesn't even play the greatest hits in a particularly memorable fashion.Ryan Gosling is a fine leading man but sadly isn't able to do anything with his character's surface level depth and very hit and miss humour. Ana De Armas is equally let down by the material, resulting in an equally fine performance not worthy of the talent on screen.Chris Evans on the other hand, is able to give the strongest performance of the film by a country mile. He's clearly enjoying being able to play against type once again and it results in a bonafide scene stealing, larger than life character.The Russo Brothers direction is very mixed. The film is competently shot for the most part but hindered by some distracting and misplaced drone shots. The film has a few moments of style but is extremely dull and bland overall.The action sequences are equally hit and miss. Many are enjoyable on a base level but still too choppy or obscured by random things but a couple have genuine weight and impact. The CG is distractingly cheap which really breaks the larger set pieces."
tt1649418,5.0,"The Gray Man (2022) :
Movie Review -The Avengers director duo, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, have teamed up for an action drama with Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, Ana De Armas, and Dhanush. What we expect from the trailer is an action-packed ride, and nothing else. Netflix has already done it last year with Red Notice, which broke records on OTT viewing. Now, with the same aim, the Russo Bros have tried their version of a spy-action-drama with a basic old plot and a lot of action. The duo deliver some high-octane action sequences to make fans happy, but the film doesn't know anything better about the storyline. The old cliches bore you despite a short runtime, with action sequences working as the saving grace.The film follows the hunt for the CIA's most skilled mercenary known as Court Gentry, aka Sierra Six (Ryan Gosling), who has accidentally uncovered dark secrets of the agency. He becomes a primary target and is hunted around the world by a psychopathic former colleague, Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), and international assassins. Another CIA agent, Dani Miranda (Ana de Armas), accompanies Six just to save her reputation, while Lloyd calls upon a sexy Tamil friend, Avik (Dhanush), a merciless killer. The cat and mouse game between Lloyd and Six forms the crux of the rest of the story. While following a cliched plot, The Gray Man tries no variety at all, which hurts. The screenplay seems pacy due to back-to-back chase sequences and action stunts, but lacks interesting conflicts.Performance-wise, Ryan Gosling as Sierra Six is decent. Frankly, this isn't an acting-driven film, but still, the actors try to add something extra of their own, which is noticeable. Six's character is quite prominent because of Ryan's physics and emotional quotient. Chris Evans' gruesomeness as Lloyd and his never-care-for-anyone attitude with humour packs a good punch. However, the basic points like reliability and temperament are missing from his character. The female forces, Ana De Armas, Julia Butters and Alfre Woodard, have done well with their limited screen space, but they do play important roles in the film. Indian actor Dhanush has like a 10-minute role, and it's all about merciless and bloodshed action. Yes, he has his heart in the right place, which will surely please his die-hard fans.The technical aspects of The Gray Man are below par. Except for brilliant cinematography, the other technical aspects fail to leave a mark. Stephen F. Windon's camerawork may not be that great, but look out for those action scenes. The way he pans and shifts the camera in the darkness is indeed praiseworthy. The editing by Jeff Groth and Pietro Scalia has had a few problems coming continuously right from the beginning. It's an action-packed film alright; that's some extra boost for sure, but the background score doesn't grow as it should have been. The action stunts are enjoyable, though.The Russo Brothers have adopted the novel with no extra features, which makes things very corny. Also, their intention to start a franchise based upon a novel seems interesting. The reputation of the Avengers films has put tremendous pressure on Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, and I guess that's why anything they make looks underwhelming. Of course, not every film they make can be that big and marvellous, so it's okay to look for a different view through different perspectives. The Gray Man takes you on an action-packed ride filled with out-and-out merciless fight scenes and bloodshed, despite the weak story at the centre. So overall, it's a watchable affair for your eyes if you don't mind not putting extra strain on your brain.RATING - 5/10*"

tt13345606,5.0,"I hate writing this review, because I feel like maybe I missed something here, but I didn't love Evil Dead RiseThe film starts off with a great opening scene then goes back a day prior to explain what is occurring. I really like the setting of this being in an apartment, as it gives the film more dread. I also love how the children give a back story/urban legend explanation then find the hidden book in a really cool way. I guess I wanted more if this back story, as it's really cool.The movie then goes pretty break neck and carnage ensues. The character development isn't great, so I didn't really care that they were all in this awful situation. The acting is good for sure, especially the mother, she makes the film.There's a lot of blood in this flick, and maybe I watch too many horrymovies, but I wanted this to be more brutal with gore. Blood and gore are different to me, just to clarify. Anyway, when I found out this was initially made to be released via streaming, it made more sense.I think there's a good movie in here, but it fell flat for me. I loved the 2013 reboot, so maybe my expectations were off. I guess you could do way worse for a fun time in theaters, but to end ""I'm not mad, just disappointed""."

It starts with a really cool opening scene that had my jaw dropped. And an epic opening title shot that reminded me of Fury Road's.The entire movie is so loud and bombastic. You could say the same about the violence. It's brutal. I love that they take full advantage of the R-rating. It doesn't hold back. I liked all of the kill scenes and carnage.So why didn't I like this more? I have no idea. I was having a decent time. But I wasn't fully engaged or attached. My mind wandered a couple times.

tt13345606,6.0,"After all the hype, the rave reviews, the revealing trailers, and the silly reaction videos (God, how I hate those), Evil Dead Rise turns out to be exactly what I expected: a serviceable sequel, nothing more, nothing less. Like the remake before it, it delivers on the gore, but is lacking in originality and likeable characters.The film takes place in a rundown apartment building, home to single mother Ellie (Alyssa Sutherland) and her three obnoxious brats, Bridget (Gabrielle Echols), Danny (Morgan Davies) and Kassie (Nell Fisher). After an earthquake hits the area, Danny discovers a secret vault below the building's underground car park where he finds an ancient book and three old records. Playing the discs unleashes an ancient evil that possesses his mother and spreads to other people in the building. On hand to protect the kids and fight the evil is Ellie's sister Beth (Lily Sullivan).Writer/director Lee Cronin conducts matters in a workmanlike manner, ladling on the blood and slime, killing off characters that might reasonably be expected to survive many a horror movie, and throwing in a few nods to the original movies to appease long-time fans of all things Evil Dead (I particularly enjoyed the EDII flying eyeball scene); unfortunately, the film wastes its promising locale by confining most of the action to one apartment and doesn't generate much in the way of atmosphere or genuine scares (I didn't jump once).What the film sorely needed was more imagination and creativity (in both story and direction), and characters that I could actually care about -- exactly the qualities that still make the original film the best of the franchise.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb."
tt13345606,5.0,"It's... good. It checked all the necessary marks. Being a huge fan of the franchise I went in knowing what to expect. But there's something missing from this entry that becomes more evident when you try to rank all five films. I can't say it's better than the previous four, yet I still don't know why.I guess an apartment building can't beat the cabin or medieval times. But the humor was severely lacking, and to be honest... the gore wasn't as relentless and shocking as I thought it would be.It reminded me of the Hellraiser remake released by Hulu or the recent Shudder original films. The X factor is clearly missing here, and it'll take me some time to figure out exactly why. It's a good horror film. It's just not an awesome Evil Dead film."

tt13345606,5.0,"It pains me terribly to say that this movie was not good. Over the years, 'The Evil Dead (1981)' has become one of my favorite movies of all time. I've watched the director commentary multiple times to see how they created a shoe-string budget indie masterpiece, which they explain through hilarious stories from the production/filming process. The entire cast/crew put themselves through the highest of highs and the lowest of lows to get the original 'Evil Dead' made. Nothing but sheer will-power and creative ingenuity are what got the original movie made. Actual blood, sweat and tears from the cast and crew poured onto the original, glorious-looking Necronomicon. None of that love went into this movie.We've seen what a modern 'Evil Dead' can look like with 2013's remake, which I thought was pretty good, definitely miles better than this. This movie was extremely tame, way too tame to have 'Evil Dead' in the title. The cheese grater scene that was hyped up so much (that I was looking most forward to), that they made a WHOLE POSTER FOR, turned out to be a MASSIVE let down. The tattoo gun scene you get a glimpse of in the trailer? Also a massive let down. Why were they so afraid to show gore and intense violence in this one? 2013 (and the originals) went WAY harder than this. For God sake, a woman gets assaulted by a tree within the first 20 minutes of the original! No boundaries are pushed with this entry. It makes no sense why they went so tame for this, especially since Terrifier 2 (which just released last year and made BANK at the boxoffice) was extremely BRUTAL and had insanely gory and violent scenes that showed off somewhat cheesey, but also very impactful practical effects (what 'Evil Dead' is supposed to be all about).There was a decade between this and the 2013 remake, and tons of production time, so why was the script so bad? The way the Necronomicon was discovered in this movie was some of the most lazy, terrible writing I have seen in years. Also, what is up with the characters? None of them are likable and they're all female, half of which are pronoun warriors. If I didnt know any better, I would've thought Disney had their hand in the writing material for this entry. The 'Evil Dead' franchise broke the mold by being one of the very few horror franchises to have a male be the hero/survivor. 99% of horror movies (especially today) have a final girl. We had Jane Levy as Mia in the 2013 remake swap roles with Ash by being the sole survivor of the Deadites, and I thought that worked pretty well. Levy kicked ass and earned her right to be the final girl. That is not the case in this movie.Another thing I don't understand is if they're going to do something different with the franchise, why not go all the way? What I mean is that they changed the setting, and that's about it. The Necronomicon was discovered in the same way (albeit WAY dumber and less believable in this entry), the story beats were nothing new, a close knit group has to defend themselves from the Deadites, etc etc. Almost nothing but the setting (which they didn't even use well) was anything new for the franchise, so I'm not sure why they're trying to pass it off as some game-changing entry. They also used one floor of the apartment for 90% of the movie, so it's not like they even changed the setting that much.The homages in this movie felt so out of place, like they were forced into the movie. 'Evil Dead Rise's' eyeball homage made me roll my eyes to the back of my skull, hoping I'd become possessed myself because it felt so forced. I could feel the director writing all these homages with a big grin on his face like 'Oh yeah, Mr. Raimi's gonna love this hehehe!'. At least 2013 was subtle with their homages, whereas this movie was just blatant and forced, making the homages feel extremely out of place. I'd rather they just did their own thing and not have any homages at all than get the homages I got.THE GOOD PARTS:
The main possessed mom actress stole the show. When she first got possessed, her movements and facial expressions were top notch. I'd say she's the best Deadite probably since first two 'Evil Dead' movies. I would even go to say she may be the best demonic portrayal in many years. She was really chewing up the scenery early on. Everyone else was just meh, but it's not the actors' fault that their characters are trashcans.Obviously, there was gore, but really not that much, and when there was gore, a lot of the times it was implied. They'd pan away a lot when a kill or something gruesome was about to happen, or the character would kick the demon off before getting brutalized. This is easily the most tame 'Evil Dead' entry; some guys in the bathroom were even saying the same thing. The demon kill count is also pathetic; none of these women could kill a demon for the life of them. The theater I was in was damn near sold out, yet my girlfriend and I were the only ones to laugh during the entire showing. Everyone else was dead silent throughout the whole movie, so that should let you know how things were going.OVERALL, this was a massive disappointment, but not just as an 'Evil Dead' movie, but as a horror movie. The movie doesn't stand on it's own enough; story and lore-wise, it just doesn't really carry the franchise forward in any meaningful way, leaving me questioning what the point of the movie is. At this point, I think it would be best for the 'Evil Dead' franchise to do what 2018's 'Halloween' did and only count the original 'Evil Dead' as existing, then make a trilogy from there. That being said, do it better than the new 'Halloween' trilogy because those took a nosedive quick. I'm not saying 'Don't see this movie'. By all means, see it. But don't expect to be on the edge of your seat terrified. Don't expect creative and crazy camera work, lighting or practical effects. Don't expect the franchise's story to move forward in any meaningful way. But most saddening, don't expect any soul in this movie (possibly because it was sucked dry by the studio). Hopefully, for the next entry, they get Damien Leone or Ari Aster, someone who is passionate and thrives in the indie horror scene and pushes boundaries when it comes to extreme horror; something 'Evil Dead' is supposed to be about, but apparently not this time.EDIT (May 5): Upon a second viewing, I've gotta admit... that this movie is indeed bad. I double down on everything I said previously. They did to Evil Dead what Disney did to Star Wars. How they found the book is awful, the deaths (which are almost all off screen) were lame and uninspired, the setting was completely wasted, and all the characters were worthless and annoying. This movie felt like a dumb kid (Lee Cronin) copying an essay of a smart kid (Sam Raimi) and just changing one word per paragraph to try and pass it off as their own. What a joke.5.1/10."
tt13345606,5.0,"When you watch this flick you need to know what to expect. This film is loosely based on the Evil Dead trilogy, but without Bruce Campbell or any character that is suppose to replace him. Instead the plot takes place in an apartment complex in Downtown Los Angeles. The main characters in the film is a family consisting of a single mother and three kids. They are joined by the mother's sister who works as a sound engineer and been away because she's on tour with a rock band (her sister has given her the misplaced nickname ""groupie). Since the sister isn't aware of the divorce, they decide to have a talk and the kids are asked to go and buy pizza to let the grownups talk in piece. When the kids return with the pizza in the garage of the apartment complex there's an earthquake. The floor in the garage is opened and below them is a bank vault. The son of the family jumps down. Down in the abandoned vault he finds The Book of the Dead. He decides to bring it with him home, a decision he will later regret. That's when the horror begins. It's the mother who is first to be cursed by the demon. My opinion about this film is that it's ok as a horror movie, but if you're expecting a worthy sequal to Evil Dead look elsewhere. This film lacks an important component of the previous films and that's humour. Neither is there any bad ass character like Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell), instead it's a group of four women and a boy. It feels like it's been a conscious choice to make the main hero of the film a woman and that the men should only play a marginal role. That doesn't have to be a problem, but in this movie it feels too obvious. That is, contemporary values have influenced the plot a lot. I would rather have wanted to see a plot that resembles the original. Sam Raimi's Drag me to Hell is doing exactly that. It's got the humour and the bad ass feeling. This film had none of that. Even if both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are listed as producers, I doubt that they have had much impact regarding the end result."
tt0120915,5.0,"Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I've always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with ""The Phantom Menace"" is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he's just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.For one thing, this project is limited by the fact that anyone familiar with the first trilogy knows the story's outcome, and it therefore lacks some of the suspense associated with a gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, this situation leaves Lucas with very little freedom as a storyteller. It also encourages him to gloss over key events; because their outcome is a foregone conclusion, he forgets to bring them to life.For example, we know there will eventually be a romance between Anakin and Padme. So Lucas has the two characters meet here and--surprise, surprise--they seem to like each other. Their developing friendship isn't portrayed that clearly, and their motivations for becoming close aren't explained. Because Lucas fails to make scenes like these believable, we can't help being conscious of how he's manipulating the plot in his effort to connect the two trilogies. Another good example of this problem is Anakin's portrayal as a potential Jedi. There doesn't appear to be anything about this kid remotely out of the ordinary, even though the other characters keep talking like there is. Our only reason for thinking he's special is that the plot requires it.If the story fails to be engaging, it is because we never see the important events. Lucas makes a fatal error in not showing what's happening on Naboo, the small planet whose capture is the focus of the plot. Numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against the planet's inhabitants, but we only know about this because the characters on screen refer to the events, usually rather woodenly.The deadpan performances are a problem in themselves, but they only highlight our lack of involvement in the story. Think of Han Solo sweating in fear, then think of the emotional vacuums passing for characters in this film. Whenever any of the characters do express emotion, as in the scene where Anakin and his mom part, it still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages to keep the emotional reactions of his characters to a minimum, which gives the film an almost mechanical feel.It's true that ""A New Hope"" never showed Alderaan's inhabitants, but we still could feel the tragedy of the planet's destruction through the horrified reactions of Princess Leia and Obi Wan. Moreover, there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly, such as the slaying of rebels at the beginning; the capture and torture of the princess; and the murder of Luke's foster parents. Furthermore, the major plot elements were intriguing in and of themselves. They weren't there merely to show us how they were to be linked to later events, which seems to be the case with the new film.I suspect that Lucas was not as concerned in the first trilogy with what had to happen later in the story and was therefore able to focus his attention on the events at hand. The weakest segment was ""Return of the Jedi,"" which had the task of bringing the story to an end. Only then did Lucas start to show signs of forcing plot points. In ""The Phantom Menace,"" he gets so bogged down in the task of bringing his story from point A to point B that he ends up with only the bare bones of a plot, and none of it comes alive.This is especially true of the characterization. In the old trilogy, characters like Yoda and Han reveal distinct personalities in their first few minutes on screen. This film goes for more than two hours and the characters, including the familiar ones, come off vague and nondescript. We aren't given much of a chance to experience their personalities in the way they interact. We must take Qui Gon's word for it when he describes Obi Wan as ""headstrong."" What's most odd is that the cartoons seem better developed than the humans. The scenes where Qui Gon negotiates with the birdlike slave-owner Watto are amusing and well-done--probably the movie's best scenes aside from the stunning action sequences--but they can't hold a candle to the constant interactions throughout the first trilogy.One thing I cannot do is accuse the film of lacking creativity. The design of the creatures, the technologies, and the planets is impressive. Watching the film is sort of like reading a children's book that isn't very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations. There is certainly a ""wow"" factor in the movie's visuals, but the effect of it is short-lived.I get irked when I hear fans talk as though the ""Star Wars"" movies were never about anything beyond special effects. While the inventive visuals are part of what made the originals so revolutionary, they're not what made the films so fun to watch. And in no way can they explain the trilogy's continuing popularity today. After all, many of the original effects look primitive by today's standards, and their novelty has certainly worn off. Only an enduring and compelling storyline could have allowed the first three films to become the classics they're almost universally acknowledged to be."

tt0120915,6.0,"I still remember the first time I tried to watch this movie. I was 13 when I watched the original trilogy for the first time and I loved it. I wasn't really interested in seeing the prequels as I heard they are not good, but then I caught this one on TV few months after watching the originals and I barely made it through the first half and then I stopped. I absolutely hated it and even called it the worst movie ever for some time. Then there was the entire hype for The Force Awakens and I decided to watch them all before seeing The Force Awakens, doesn't matter if I don't like some of them, I'll watch them all. So, after watching the original trilogy, it was the time for this one. I was kinda bored at the beginning, but later realized that it's actually not bad at all. The effects look a little dated, but a lot of them were practical, so I'll forgive them. The acting is nothing special, just good enough to not be bad and Ewan McGregor probably gave the best performance and he's one of the very few who stand out. But what really made me like this movie is the villain, Darth Maul. He's one of the coolest villains ever and is my favorite Star Wars character so far. Too bad he's so underused and I really hope they make a spin-off (in my opinion, he's a much more interesting character than Boba Fett) about him or bring him back in the new trilogy. Ray Park also nailed the role even with only few lines (from what I heard, it wasn't even his voice), but he's really intimidating and I could talk about his character all day but I'll stop now to say more about the movie. And the award for the worst comic relief ever goes to Jar Jar Binks! He's one of the biggest reasons people hate this movie and you'll see why. And while everyone is talking about him, everyone forgets about Sebulba. Gosh, that underrated a-hole! He's the most annoying character in every movie ever! These two were also a big reason why I used to hate this movie. Looking on the directing, Lucas didn't do the greatest job ever, and considering he was also a writer of this movie, and looking back at A New Hope, we all know he can do much better then this. But still, it turned out okay, could've been better, but it's not the worst in the series. The worst in my opinion comes after this, with Attack of the Clones. But I'm not gonna say much about it here, I'll leave that for it's own review."
tt0120915,5.0,Bad movie and CGI The film is very bad until the year it was released. The story of the film was very bad. The character of Queen Amidala was bad. The only thing that intercedes for the movie is a Jade fight with Darth Maul.
tt0120915,5.0,"The galaxy is run by the Republic, however they are under treat of a Rebellion run by the Trade Federation.  Sinister forces are also at work within both the Republic and the Federation and the Empire has it's hands in both in the form of Darth Sidious and his protégé Darth Maul.  Meanwhile Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and his pupil Obi Wan travel to protect the planet of Queen Amidala, along the way they find a child strong in the force and resolve to train up the child Anakin Skywalker in the ways of the Jedi.The first Star Wars movie (albeit number 4 in the production order) was always going to have a lot to live up to  after all we've been waiting for over 15 years!  Maybe that's why it was so poorly received.  The story isn't the most exciting thing due to the fact that it's setting up the coming films  the Empire is years away and is mostly in the background.  There's a lot of politics involved that make little sense and don't appear to go anywhere and this slows the film down.The film's focus is dull because the child Anakin is pretty innocent and cute  he is yet to have any hint of his future.  The action is quite cartoony and the ground battle at the end is as much reliant on slapstick comedy as it is on action.  In fairness to the film  it is less of an entity in itself and more of the stepping stone to the other films, it was never going to be the best of the lot  the best SHOULD be parts 3,4 and 5 as they are where the main action occurs (although we don't know what was planned for 7-9).  However that doesn't mean it shouldn't be good but it's bad in a number of ways.First of it totally lacks any sense of wonder or fun.  The effects may be better but the fun is gone, the characters are wooden and dry, the politics is dry etc.  Even when chased by a giant fish the Jedi remain unshakable  compare that to the action of Han Solo etc involved in a chase!  The characters are undeveloped and those that are created to be `fun' are actually annoying  namely Jar Jar Binks.  This `thing' is supposedly for children but he's just not funny.  If anything I find his `messa sorry' dialogue to be almost racist!  Could he have been made to sound more like a cotton-picking slave?  His slapstick antics aren't funny, they may amuse very young kids but compare him to the comedy of C3PO and R2D2  they were value for kids and adults alike and they weren't annoying!  To me the main concern is that it's just not fun  this only exists in a few good action scenes or a few comedy moments  but I wasn't enjoying it, I was only watching it.All the actors may be quality but they all treat the material with such respect that you'd think they were doing Shakespeare.  In part 2 they are still a bit dry but at least they get to have character and be a bit more life-like.  The only character that stood out was Darth Maul  even without any significant dialogue, at least he had passion and energyshame really!Overall this is just a stepping-stone to allow you to move on in the series. As a film it isn't enjoyable apart from a few scenes including the double-ended light sabre and the pod-race.  Happily Lucas put much of the faults right for part 2 but really as a film Part 1 is a disappointment."
tt12412888,5.0,"On the one hand, Sonic & Tails are great (their voice actors and animation are solid) knuckles is decent too. Eggman at times feels a bit too much like Carrey being Carrey, but he still does a great job portraying him.Where does this movie go wrong then? It has a lot of time wasted on cast members nobody cares about - like a bride, and this coupled with the minimal moments showing Sonic's world make me realize how much better this would've been if it was all animation and not mixed with live actors in real shoots.At times Paramount make this movie goofy too with 4th wall breaking lines and overuse of hip-hop, they aren't even that funny.There's some good action sequences and as above the actual characters from the classic games are well done, but it feels like everything else is kind of weak and off focus.Worth a watch, but not one I'd be eager to watch again."
tt12412888,5.0,"The first Sonic the Hedgehog film was surprisingly fun...and so I was excited to go see this sequel. Sadly, however, I thought the sequel lacked much of the charm of the first and emphasized battles and special effects instead.The film unites Sonic with Knuckles and Tails...his friends from the video game sequels to ""Sonic the Hedgehog"". Initially, however, the evil Dr. Robotnik convinces Knuckled to work with him...and only due to his huberis does it become apparent to the rather dim Knuckles that the Doctor ISN'T the nice guy he claims to be. This leads to an ultimate battle which takes up most of the final half of the movie...with Sonic, Knuckles and Tails taking on the crazed doctor.To put it quite bluntly...this film isn't as fun nor as charming as the first. Instead, it's much more action-oriented. To make it worse, I loved Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik/Egghead in the first film...but here his clever reparte was lacking. Overall, watchable and not bad....but disappointing because it could have been so much better.By the way, if you do plan on seeing this, try seeing it in theaters....you'll lose much on the TV screen because there is just so much action."
tt12412888,5.0,"I'm sorry but was it an unannounced extended cut? Was I simply not aware of it? If not, then why the heck was this film so stretched? I can understand when a certain script demands an extra bit of time to build up the tale or to settle some essential things, for Sonic 2 though, I still don't get the urgency, what was the necessity? Really, what was it?I mean sure you have two new characters in this sequel who need adequate introductions but what about the rest of the cast? The humour is obnoxiously loud, the performances (except for Jim Carrey) were awful and on top of all that you have this dubious CGI; which was supposed to be the film's main attraction, what a shame!Now following the success of the first film, it is quite obvious that the creators had the green light from the studio to spend additional cash this time and guess what they did; however, to our utter dismay, it appears as if they have only utilised that extra bit of budget to demonstrate some cool action set pieces and nothing else!Had they invested a small percentage of their budget into hiring a better Screenwriter; things could have been much different! Why? Cause the Screenplay was poorly paced. Not only it was tiresome but it also dragged the whole movie down with it.The only good things that are worth remembering are Sonic and his newfound counterparts (Tails and Knuckles). Perhaps it's my nostalgia talking here but yeah I was having fun whenever these characters were in focus."
tt12412888,6.0,"I didn't see the first movie, so I'm not sure how this compares, but I found this movie pretty upbeat and entertaining. It took me a moment to get used to how the movie set up Sonic in the real world, and from then on the plot carried things well enough.Knuckles as a character was my favorite part of this movie, with Tails being a close second. I enjoyed the action and how simple the plotline was, too, but some of the jokes and memes fell a bit flat for me. (Looking at you, Eggman.) The dance battle also felt a bit silly, but that's to be expected. Overall, I had a good time watching, and would recommend this movie if you like Sonic and have some time to kill."
tt3829266,6.0,"I'd heard nothing but bad things about The Predator, wall to wall hatred and mockery. It was even suggested that it was one of the worst movies of 2018 and comparable with the messy AVP movies. Going in I was forced to have low expectations, and I firmly disagree.Let's make something clear, I am not saying The Predator is a good film because it simply isn't but worst of 2018? Absolutely not. It's just a badly flawed addition to the franchise yet manages to be oddly loyal at the same time.So a Predator comes to Earth but this time the government is ready for it. Cue lots of action, blood shed but a pretty wafer thin plot that doesn't exactly go anywhere.With a stellar cast including Thomas Jane, the stunning Olivia Munn and the excellent Keegan-Michael Key it had no problems on that front. Okay actually I retract that, the leading man Boyd Holbrook is less than impressive and just wasn't up to the task.With an odd amount of comedy and levity The Predators tone isn't exactly in keeping with the original movies yet manages to solidly feel like a Predator film thanks to the original score and franchise tropes. I loved the first movie, I thought the second was passable and hated the third but this right here is underwhelming yet perfectly watchable despite the lashings of Hollywoodness it has.Sure it's goofy and badly flawed but I'm not sure exactly what everyone expected. There are certainly a lot of problems with the film, I'd have liked it to be darker, I'd have liked it to be longer and I'd liked the original Predator to have gotten more screentime.Regardless despite it's many many problems it comes under the category of harmless take your brain out fun.The Good:Loyal scoreSome great nods to previous moviesQuite a few very funny momentsDecent castThe Bad:Lacks elements that should be essential for a Predator movieNaff endingMuch of the cast feel wasted"

tt3099498,5.0,"Ah, Kevin Smith – I knew him well (mainly in the nineties during his Clerks, Mallrats and Chasing Amy period). I would always say that he's one hell of a writer of dialogue, whether his work falls straight into the 'comedy' bracket, or he dabbles in other genres, i.e. romance, science-fiction fantasy or horror. And, this time round, he's playing with the 'horror genre.' 'Tusk' tells the tale of a complete idiot (played delightfully by Justin Long). He's a typical product of the modern age – a podcaster with ideas way above his station. Yes, he's a little bit famous, but it appears that a little bit of fame corrupts almost as much as absolute power. He thinks he's 'it' and lets everyone know it, whether it's his co-presenter, his doting girlfriend, or generally anyone he meets along the way.One article on his upcoming podcast is an interview with a Canadian 'celebrity' who's also made his name on the internet. Sadly, the 'celebrity' in question is so traumatised with his newfound fame that he kills himself, 'selfishly' leaving our glorious podcaster with nothing to report on while in Canada. That's when he happens upon an interesting offer in a men's restroom. It leads him to a reclusive hermit, played brilliantly by Michael Parks, who offers to tell him his life's story.This is the fun part. The interaction between the two is just about as perfect as dialogue can be. The two exchange tales and taken on life in the setting of Park's Gothic mansion. The tension is cranked right up to the max – you know something is going to happen (something bad, obviously), but you just don't know what. This atmosphere is just electrifying when combined with the snappy dialogue. Everything is going great until......the film just kind of switches atmosphere and great dialogue for cheap shocks. And shocks that look pretty bad rather than shocking. The second half of the film is everything that the first half isn't, i.e. cheesy. Yeah, there are a few moments of brilliance thrown in there, but, when you realise what's actually happening, you'll probably just shout, 'What... seriously?' It just doesn't work. It feels like someone has tacked a second (lesser) film onto a good one. If I was rating the first half I'd say it was awesome. If I was rating the second half I'd say don't bother. Fans of Kevin Smith may like the dialogue (like I did), but most people will not really go for this on account of the sudden change in mood that doesn't fit where the film was originally heading.Best to watch this one for free however you can before you invest in actually paying for it. Some people may find the second half as shocking as it was intended. Personally, I just found it a let down and stupid. Pity."
tt3099498,6.0,"This is a 100 minute movie by prolific writer and director Kevin Smith. The cast is pretty good It only consists of four people really, but all of them played their parts well. The first half belongs to Justin Long, the second half belongs to Johnny Depp (almost unrecognizable). Also in there are the stunning Genesis Rodriguez and Academy Award nominee Haley Joel Osment (""The Sixth Sense""). The latter two have an affair with Long's character being the real boyfriend to Rodriguez' character. However, he constantly cheats on her and treats her and everybody else like crap. Osment's character really loves her and comforts her and this is how the two became a couple. Obviously they made Long's character as despicable as possible, so you will not really have too much sympathy for what happens to him as the film goes on. The two guys have a show together, so Long's character travels to Canada to find interesting people to talk to and interview for their program. He finds a note and visits an old man's house. Sadly, that one has no good things in mind and intends to transform his victim into a walrus to re-enact a scene from his life from many decades ago. In the end, the evil guy gets into a walrus costume himself and the two fight like real animals.This was one of the weirdest things I have seen in a long time. The moment Long's character was seen for the first time as a walrus was like the biggest wtf-moment ever. The whole thing can probably be categorized as a horror movie, but it is all so absurd that it can also be described as comedy. There were a couple funny scenes, like when they call the police in the car and say ""not-see party"" and the police officer immediately hangs up. This was the funniest moment for me. Or another (not so) funny scene when he says he does not want to die in Canada. And it works as drama too. That final shot one year later was actually pretty sad. I recommend this film especially to people who liked ""The Human Centipede"". It reminded me a lot of this one. Or just to people who are looking for something different. As weird as it gets."

In this case ""they"" being stories about what the movie is about, not Human Centipede (with which this is kinda rightfully being compared).Kevin Smiths talk track on the movie is insightful, though it might be a bit too much for some. A bit too much can also be attributed to the movie as a whole. This is not for the faint hearted mind you. This is not your Clerks movie or anything like it. Though the bits with Haley (I know, if you watch Sixth Sense before this and then this, it might be a shock to see him like this) and Justin could be attributed to that genre, but they are not the main focus here.The fact that Michael Parks is in the main role (was also in Smiths Red State) elevates this movie for me.

But no, it's a king of psychological thriller crossed with a feminist polemic (most of the creatives behind the camera are women, and there's nothing wrong with that).And, to be fair, the film is about sexual power politics and, while it recognises that men can pose a physical danger to women, it also recognises that women can destroy men with mere allegations. It draws no conclusions, and that's fair enough, but it paints an unremittingly dark picture of what is essentially an ill-matched, ill-considered relationship arising from mismatched expectations and poor choices.It's an attempt to do something worthwhile and interesting, and it partially succeeds, for which I praise it but, to be frank, it's a bit boring."
tt14647404,6.0,"I saw this as part of an Odeon Screen unseen showing so was completely and literally in the dark about what I was going to see. Well I was pleasantly surprised. It's a tale about 20 year old Margot and her bouncing around the excitement and misunderstandings of relationships and how communication, expectation and reality can all blow things up.There were times whenn I expected the story to go down a sinister route but then was I being manipulated by the opening quote?Worth your time. This is just a privileged view into a 20 year Old's life which reverberated with me on many levels. If you approach this as just that then you won't be disappointed."
tt14647404,6.0,"Men are afraid what women will say, women are afraid what men might do. This is the trailer quote. For good measure the Margaret Atwood quote is added on screen. ""Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them"" - Margaret Atwood. Now we know where we stand. Margot, a student, does a side job at a cinema when Robert, a regular there, asks for her phone number. Margot's friend Taylor keeps advising Margot about potential dangers from Robert and advises her how to keep Robert at arm's length. Robert claims to be a cat person but Margot doesn't see a cat on a short visit to Robert so this is a red flag that he might be a serial killer. Margot has a lecturer who informs her that some male ants will ""get their ""comeuppance"" for not protecting their Queen and joyfully tells her that male Bees die from having sex the first and only time they do. Margot has sex with Robert when she doesn't really want to in order not to upset Robert who might do something if upset. So she pretends to have a good time and later dumps him by text. He's confused by all this having believed she reciprocated his feelings. Meanwhile Margot acts as if he's a serial killer.I would say the first half is a dark comedy and the second half gets serious. I've only given it a 6 because it's not completely unwatchable but don't expect any serious answers as what to do about women who assume the worse of men."
tt14647404,6.0,"Cat Person, the 2023 film adaptation of Kristen Roupenian's viral New Yorker short story, claws its way onto the screen with a promising premise: exploring the awkward, unsettling, and sometimes dangerous landscape of modern dating. Unfortunately, despite stellar performances and flashes of brilliance, the film ultimately stumbles, failing to recapture the potent ambiguity and unsettling dread that resonated with so many readers.Margot, a college student, finds herself drawn to the enigmatic Robert, an older man who works at the local movie theatre. Their initial interactions via text are playful and flirty, but when they finally meet in person, the sparks don't quite fly. A nagging unease settles in, hinting at something darker beneath Robert's charming facade.Director Susanna Fogel expertly navigates the film's early scenes, capturing the awkward tension and anxieties that plague young love. Emilia Jones delivers a nuanced performance as Margot, portraying her vulnerability and growing unease with authenticity. Nicholas Braun, however, struggles to fully inhabit the enigmatic Robert, leaving the character feeling somewhat opaque and underdeveloped.The visual storytelling in the movie is its strongest point. Cinematographer Manuel Billeter paints a stark portrait of Margot's emotional world, using tight close-ups and muted colour palettes to emphasise her growing isolation and fear. The score, a blend of unsettling electronic beats and melancholic piano melodies, further amplifies the film's unsettling mood.However, as the film progresses past the point at which the original story ends, the plot begins to unravel. The narrative takes a jarring turn, veering away from the ambiguity and suspense that characterised the short story and instead opting for a more conventional, even melodramatic, thriller plot. This shift in tone feels jarring and ultimately undermines the film's emotional core.Cat Person is a film with undeniable potential. It boasts strong performances, particularly from Jones, and a visually striking aesthetic. However, those who have read the original story may be disappointed with its failure to capture the essence of the original and its jarring tonal shift, ultimately leaving it feeling like a missed opportunity.While not a complete failure, Cat Person is best suited for fans of the original short story or those seeking a darkly comedic thriller. For those looking for a more faithful adaptation or a deeply unsettling exploration of modern dating, this film may not be the cat's meow."
tt14647404,6.0,"When the movie opened with the quote ""Men are scared women will laugh at them. Women are scared men will kill them"", I thought ""Uh oh, here we go. Another 'All men are nasty' movie"". But it ended up being more nuanced than that, a bit messier and less black and white, just like real life. Both protagonists were a little bit wrong and a little bit right, so I thank the writer for bringing a more balanced and less predictable perspective to how relationships can unfold.The film had its share of dramatic moments but also had lighter moments interspersed, with imagined scenarios, which provided a little light and shade.Overall, a thought provoking movie with more than one perspective."
tt14647404,6.0,"Margot, barely looking 19, works in a theater that showcases old horror films and cult flicks. She encounters a customer who is obviously every bit of 35 who she imagines is only 25. If you're a woman over thirty expect to feel immediately creeped out. Her crush Robert is every weird neck beard guy on the Internet and she's too young to see it. However as a woman I still related to her torturous courting phase of texting a new love interest. That's the thing about this movie - if their icky age difference doesn't get under your skin THE IRRITATING REALNESS of their interactions will.This is discomfort and annoyance as horror. It's quirky and funny but the kind of funny Curb Your Enthusiasm or Fawlty Towers is i.e. Hell is other people and every day social interactions are anxiety inducing.Robert just gets worse and worse. He isn't nicer than you as an adult woman think he might get as the movie progresses, he is that creep that forces his stupid Star Wars movies on you, your own opinion as his date be darned. Even worse he gets this 20 year old girl to his house and starts acting 40, playing Depeche Mode. The sex is bad, he doesn't have the cats he claimed to have and he's every weird middle aged guy cruising for little girls and forcing his terrible personality on her. The only voice of reason in sight is Margot's best friend.I'm not sure what the real point or message of this movie is but it's not pleasant to watch. Horror typically isn't but this is like...real life horror comedy and I'm not sure it worked for me.P. S. This movie isn't ""ambiguous"" at all. Robert is way too old for Margot, he's controlling and violent, and while she does overreact somewhat anyone who is equalizing the behavior of an adult man in his thirties with a teenager needs their head checked immediately."
tt4154664,6.0,"CAPTAIN MARVEL is the latest Marvel comics offering and the follow-up to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; inevitably it's a big step down from the success of that movie. This one goes down a much more predictable route, and it suffers hugely from having a main character who simply isn't very interesting; like Superman, her immortality and strength make her rather boring to see on screen. The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff."
tt4154664,5.0,"Travelling to Birmingham to get Easter presents for friends and family,I decided that whilst in the city I would go catch a film. Visiting the oldest working cinema in the UK (The Electric) I found a flick with a run time that would give me just enough time to catch the train home,so I get set to see the new captain of the MCU.View on the film:Whilst facially de-aged with seamless CGI,Samuel (yel)L. Jackson swaggers with a coolness that has not aged one bit, with Jackson hitting Fury's comedic punch-lines with a smooth as silk ease. The first woman superhero in the Disney Marvel films to have her own solo movie, Brie Larson brings out the heroic in Marvel's passion to save the Skrulls, but fails to fly to a super height in the comedic,and establishment of her own origins,as Larson delivers punch lines with a stilted awkwardness which allows Jackson (who has worked with Larson three times) to outshine her in the jokes, and Larson also keeps a cold distance from giving Marvel the enthusiasm other superheros have when using their powers.Designed as a origin for Captain Marvel, the writers visibly show more interest in the side characters than they do in lead, with the plight of the Skrulls bringing a heart and urgency to the mission, which drifts away in the mid-section that focuses on Marvel's dry beginnings. Dipping into the Dr Strange-style fantastical with a striking sequence of Marvel fighting her inner turmoil, co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are joined by cinematographer Ben Davis in largely skipping over the enticing fantastical (save for a cute cat) to deliver slick Marvel Comics action set-pieces and Star Wars-inspired space ship races, wrapped in a catchy 90's soundtrack leaving No Doubt on Captain Marvel's powers."
tt1259521,6.0,"I'm a Joss Wheedon fan, so I had pretty high expectations for this - and it just didn't live up to them. For a John Carpenter movie, this'd be pretty much middle of the road, and for a Ewe Boll flick, this would be a masterpiece, but it's not really up to Joss's usual standards.The single most disappointing part of the movie is the editing - much of the action is shown in dimly-lit, flash-cut closeups. The film editors, having seen all of the footage shot, know what's going on; they forget that the audience doesn't, and much of the action leaves the audience wondering what the heck just happened. This trend in cinematography is already longer-lived than it deserved; maybe Hollywood will get over the 'flash cuts cause excitement' nonsense and get back to telling the story, rather than manipulating the audience.Other than that, there was a new twist on an old genre, some good fun, some mystery to solve, some characters you could care about, and an unusual ending. Worth seeing, but don't expect a masterpiece, and accept that there's action that you won't quite be able to see."
tt1259521,5.0,"""I love being scared."" So said Joss Whedon in an interview with Total Film regarding ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" which he produced and co-wrote with director Drew Goddard. ""The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had sung a little too far in that direction."" When I first read that quote a few weeks ago, I wished Whedon had been there with me, for I wanted to shake him by the hand and thank him for publicly reaffirming what I've felt about horror movies for quite some time. But then I actually saw ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" and I couldn't help but wonder why I wasn't seeing things as he saw them. Something wasn't quite right.The film, promoted by Whedon himself as a ""very loving hate letter"" and ""a serious critique of what we love and what we don't about horror movies,"" is nowhere near as clever or insightful as it has been made to seem. Whedon and Goddard clearly have fun with a number of threadbare horror clichés, but never once do they actually say anything relevant about them. All these men really do is confirm that they exist, which is shortsighted considering the fact that most horror audiences are already well aware of this. They think they're letting us in on the joke when in fact we were in on it all along. What I was promised was satire; what I got was a confusing, ridiculous, and surprisingly depressing film in which archetypes and conventions are addressed but barely improved.Central to the story are five college kids who were clearly intended to be one-dimensional caricatures. But pointing out their shallowness and actually commenting on it are two entirely different matters, and frankly, I would have preferred the filmmakers to go in the latter direction. There's Dana, the reluctant virgin (Kristen Connolly). There's her best friend, Jules, the perpetually horny sexpot (Anna Hutchison), who just dyed her hair blonde; although she can't pronounce one of the words on Dana's math book, it's declared that she's premed. There's Jules' boyfriend, Curt, the hunky jock (Chris Hemsworth). There's Holden, the scholarly gentleman (Jesse Williams), who will inevitably fall for Dana. Finally, there's Marty, the goofy pothead (Fran Kranz), who sounds like he knows more than he initially lets on.They leave campus and take an RV to a remote part of the woods, where they vacation in a strangely decorated and certifiably creepy cabin. Little do they know that beneath the cabin lies a subterranean office superstructure, where a bureaucratic team of workers in suits, ties, and lab coats watch their every move via surveillance cameras. Two scientists, Hadley (Richard Jenkins) and Sitterson (Bradley Whitford), use a force field to seal the college kids into the wooded area and subject them to a scenario of their own design. They manipulate the circumstances as much as possible, mostly by the release of airborne chemicals that can change a person's ability to think. They eventually open the cellar, where, amidst an eclectic mix of creepy Victorian paraphernalia, Dana finds an old diary. Upon reading a Latin incantation, zombies emerge from the ground and descend on the cabin.At this point, I'm going to stop describing the plot in detail, as there are numerous twists and turns that most will not want spoiled. I will say that the film is intended to be both frightening and funny, and to an extent, it succeeds at both. In the humor department, we have more than the antics of the college kids; we have the working environment of the subterranean office. Just as it would be in an urban skyrise, we see division of labor and the formation of cliques. We see money pools and office partying, and there's even enough time to work in the playful ribbing of the nerdy intern. When they're not working, the scientists will gab about their personal lives; in the opening scene, Sitterson spends a great deal of time complain about his wife and her new cabinets.There's an extremely bloody confrontation involving every imaginable monster from the annals of horror, from wispy spirits to werewolves to giant cobras to robotic slicing machines to zombies to carnivorous mermen. All leads to a Lovecraftian ending that was not only lame-brained and inappropriate but also needlessly upsetting. Was that the point of ""The Cabin in the Woods""? To espouse a nihilistic viewpoint of humanity? If this is Whedon's idea of sticking it to the makers of slasher films and gore fests, he might want to steer clear of the horror genre altogether. I hate to think that there are other genres he feels have been corrupted. If he were to write another very loving hate letter, say for a romantic comedy or a musical, would it too end in the same way?-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
tt5198890,6.0,"Quick review: 'Eileen' is one of those films where all the pieces were there to be something great, but they just weren't quite assembled correctly. The film just comes across a little flat. There's quite a prolonged and drawn out build-up, and then the pay-off isn't quite worthy of it. I still liked the film, don't get me wrong, but I can't help feeling it could've been something more.There are a few attempts at humour long the way, none of them really land though. And there are a couple of fake-out scenes that were truly shocking, but ultimately meant nothing unfortunately. Not a bad film, but not one I'm sure I'll remember much of a year from now. 6.5/10."
tt5198890,6.0,"Thomasin McKenzie is quite good as the eponymous, rather timid, prison secretary who lives a rather pedestrian life watching the couples make out in the car-park, or fantasising about a quickie with one of her colleagues, before returning home to her retired cop/dipso father replete with two bottles! The arrival of new psychologist ""Rebecca"" (Anne Hathaway) injects a little life into her dull routine. This assertive sophisticate takes an interest in ""Eileen"", they go for a drink - there's even some flirting - before ""Rebecca"" shares a secret with her new friend that involves a young man in prison accused of the brutal murder of his father, and of just what his mother might know of the crime and it's causes. The first hour is quite intriguing but that sense of anticipation is let down by a last half hour that is really quite undercooked and the denouement, well that is just incomplete - on just about every level. The acting and writing is fine - nothing more, but I left the screening thinking that something was missing. What exactly was the point here? It's a good looking film - effort has certainly gone into the aesthetic but I'm not sure I'm really any the wiser."
tt5198890,5.0,"This movie had all the makings of a great film. Act 1 provided a satisfying introduction to our main cast and let us explore the intricacies of their personalities. It seamlessly eased into Act 2 with the twist that was greatly hinted at in both the trailer and the synopsis. Then once we get to the height of the climax the film ends. We get no Act 3 and no resolution to what went on in the whole film. Every single plot point was left open with too much room left to interpretation. I honestly got hooked onto these characters and invested in their lives and stories and from Act 1 to Act 2 I felt like the film had an average score of a 7 that turned into an 8, but when everything ended so suddenly that score in my head dropped to where it is now. This film really should have had another hour to explore the consequences of the character's actions whether they were allowed to lead their same lives or not. As for now, we as the audience will never know and that doesn't jive with this viewer.To sum up my thoughts the movie was the start of something great. But since it cut off so suddenly I'm left to wonder what the point even was."
tt5198890,6.0,"I saw Eileen, starring Thomasin McKenzie-Last Night in Soho, Jojo Rabbit; Shea Whigham-Mission: Impossible_Dead Reckoning Part One, Joker; Jefferson White-Yellowstone_tv, God's Country and Anne Hathaway-Interstellar, Get Smart_2008.I wasn't expecting too much and I wasn't disappointed. It started out alright but ended really weird. Thomasin plays a secretary at a juvenile detention center in 1960's Boston. She leads a boring life and lives with her father, Shea. Shea is a retired cop and sits around the house a lot, just drinking and swinging his service revolver around in the air-I guess to remind everyone that he used to be a cop. Jefferson plays the cop that keeps answering the call when Shea gets his gun out. Anne plays the new psychiatrist at the center and becomes friends with Thomasin. Thomasin has a lot of fantasies and day dreams-some sexual, some murderous-and starts to think that Anne may have some feelings towards her. Then, like I said, it gets weird at the end and leaves unanswered questions.It's rated R for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour 7 37 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD or stream. If I were you, I'd wait until it comes to cable tv."
tt5198890,6.0,"Watched this film because I'm a McKenzie fan. I'm gonna give credit to the brilliant acting presented by McKenzie, Hathaway and Shea Whigham (btw he's alcoholic and tortured role really reminds me of Eli Thompson in the last season of Boardwalk Empire). Girl's acting is becoming even more infectious since Last Night in SOHO and Totally Completely Fine. Her performance in the intense interrogation scene impressed me.Back to the movie, The first half is fine alright, with some nostalgic vibe beautiful aesthetic, and a decent storytelling. But the second part, after Rebecca invited Eileen to Mrs. Polk's house, things are getting out of control. The interrogation is understandable, but what happened after Eileen shot the woman was somehow lack of more explanation. I can understand that Rebecca left because they actually did not build a strong friendship (or relationship) and it was a rational choice to leave the town. As I thought there might be some twist, like something happening to Jim or Eileen, either good or bad, the movie just ended with a lot for the audience to imagine. There were even theories saying that Rebecca is Eileen's Tyler Durden, but IMO she definitely existed because there were no implications like those deliberate inconsistencies in Fight Club (and from Mrs. Polk's words we knew that she saw two women standing in front of her.)"
tt5198890,6.0,"I wish I hadn't watched this movie back-to-back with Saltburn; I would have liked more time between viewings before seeing so many similar character traits and situations. Eileen kept me interested throughout the runtime, mostly thanks to Thomasin McKenzie. A less interesting performer could have rendered this completely skippable. The movie spends a lot of time establishing what Eileen's life is like, and those details drew me in to the story. Then, Anne Hathaway's character is introduced, and the plot begins to take off. As the action continued to build, I really wanted to see where everything would end up. However, I was disappointed by the resolution; I felt like most of what we had learned about the characters became unimportant as a result of their final choices. It was hard not to feel like I had wasted my time when the credits came up because it was such an unsatisfying way to end things. It prevents me from being able to recommend this movie to anyone. I don't regret watching it, but I was definitely let down."
tt5198890,5.0,"Mark Kermode gave this film a positive review with Simon Mayo on their YouTube podcast (and made an obvious reference to the Dexys Midnight Runners song ""Come On Eileen""), it sounded like an interesting independent film and I decided to go and see it in the cinema during its limited release. Basically, set in Boston, Massachusetts in the 1960s, Eileen Dunlop (Thomasin McKenzie) is a young woman who lives a dull existence working in a youth detention/correctional facility (young offenders prison) for teenage boys. At work, Eileen is given the cold shoulder by Mrs. Murray (Siobhan Fallon Hogan) and her colleagues. She has been watching one of the inmates, Lee Polk (Sam Nivola, Alessandro's son), for some time and may be having fantasies about him. Eileen's home life is worse however, living with her widowed and alcoholic father, Jim (Shea Whigham), a former police chief who suffers from paranoia and is emotionally abusive towards his daughter. Eileen frequently daydreams about killing herself and her father. Her world is turned upside down by the arrival of a new psychologist, Rebecca Saint John (Anne Hathaway), who joins the prison staff. Eileen is immediately drawn to Rebecca's intellectual conversation and glamorous appearance. After Eileen has been talking about him, Rebecca begins working with Lee Polk, who is revealed to have stabbed his father to death and has been imprisoned since. Rebecca invites Lee's mother, Rita (Marin Ireland), to speak with her and her son, but Rita soon leaves distraught after Lee refused to speak with her. Rebecca invites Eileen to join her that evening at a local bar. Rebecca introduces Eileen to smoking, and they spend the night drinking and dancing. Rebecca kisses Eileen before leaving which excites her. The next morning, Eileen wakes up lying in her own vomit in her car and finds that Jim locked her out of the house. While cleaning the car, a local policeman visits to tell her that the neighbours have complained about Jim's violent and erratic behaviour. Consequently, Jim must relinquish his gun and give it to Eileen. At work, Eileen is upset to find out that Rebecca has already left for the Christmas holiday. Eileen spends the day sleeping on Rebecca's desk. Eileen receives a call from Rebecca on Christmas Eve, inviting her for drinks at her house. Eileen is delighted and they have a drink when she arrives. But Rebecca is panicked and eventually reveals that they are actually in the Polks' house. Rebecca arrived at the house earlier to question Rita about Lee, suspecting he was sexually abused by his father. But their conversation became heated, they got into a scuffle, and it ended with Rita falling into the basement. While Rita was unconscious, Rebecca tied her up and drugged her. Rebecca intends to coerce Rita into admitting involvement in her son's abuse and wants Eileen as her witness. Eileen reluctantly agrees to help, getting her father's gun from her car. In the basement, Rita initially refuses to answer Rebecca's questions, until Eileen threatens to shoot her. With the gun's safety off, Rita breaks down and admits that, although initially ignorant of her husband's abuse of Lee, she eventually became aware after walking in on her husband in Lee's room. She felt powerless to stop the abuse and enjoyed her husband's renewed interest in her, so it continued, she gave Lee an enema and bathed him before he went to bed. As Rita finishes her story, Eileen (perhaps accidentally) shoots her in the shoulder. As she yells in pain, Eileen and Rebecca drug Rita into unconsciousness. As Rebecca panics, Eileen suggests that they frame Jim for Rita's shooting and run away together. Eileen finally admits she has feelings and is in love with Rebecca. They carry Rita and put her into Eileen's car boot and agree to meet at Eileen's house. Arriving there, Eileen waits and looks out the window waiting for Rebecca, while her father is sleeping in his chair. After Rebecca fails to show up and dawn breaks, Eileen drives to a remote forest. She leaves the still-drugged Rita in her car and turns on the engine to asphyxiate her smoke. Before leaving, Eileen's father briefly woke up and she wished him goodnight. Eileen returned to the main road and hitches a ride, smiling to herself as she leaves the town; the fate of Rebecca is unknown. Also starring Owen Teague as Randy, Jefferson White as Buck Warren, and Tonye Patano as Mrs. Stevens. McKenzie gives a good performance as the young prison worker with strange thoughts, but Hathaway almost steals the show looking hot and being mysterious, they are an intriguing double act, I kind of hoped Whigham was on a bit more. It is a fairly simplistic story with good period detail, a near-lesbian relationship that is toxic and takes a dark turn much later is interesting, but it doesn't go quite the way I hoped or expected, it could have been more thrilling or racy, and I must say that the ending was a bit of a let-down, overall it is intriguing enough, a reasonable psychological drama. Worth watching, in my opinion!"
tt5198890,5.0,"As ""Eileen"" (2023 release; 98 min.) opens, it's the late 1950s/early 60s and we are introduced to the title character, a 24 yo who works at a corrections facility for teenage boys in New England. Eileen lives with her dad, a retired cop who is an alcoholic and emotionally abusive of Eileen. Then just in time before Christmas, the corrections facility introduces the new resident psychologist, a splashy dame from Harvard named Rebecca... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the screen adaptation of the novel of the same name, which I have not read and hence I cannot comment how closely the movie stick to the book. The best aspects of the film are the two leading performances: Thomasin McKenzie (as Eileen) and Anne Hathaway (as Rebecca) are solid, period. Alas, it's not their faut that the script leaves them shorthanded for a good part on the movie. Indeed the Big Reveal doesn't come until just over an hour into the movie, and hence the ""crime drama"" part gets only the last half hour. Id this a ""bad"" movie? It is not. But neither is it great or a ""near classic"" as another reviewer here puts it. For that the movie lacks the necessary punch.""Eileen"" is currently playing in US theaters. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (only 3 people including myself). Even though ""Eileen"" is currently rated 85% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, I can't see this playing much longer in the theater. Of course don't take my word for it, so if you are in the mood for an ok, but just ok, psychological crime drama, check it out and draw your own conclusion."
tt5198890,5.0,"The ending of a film plays a crucial role, and unfortunately, despite a well-developed plot and a suspenseful atmosphere, this film falls short with a simple message of ""good family is everything"" at the end, making it forgettable.I particularly enjoyed the atmosphere and color palette, which truly immersed me; however, the ending, concluding with a cliché message about the significance of a good family, turned the film into an annual watch rather than leaving a lasting impression. I don't believe the film deserved such an ending, considering the importance of the theme.I appreciated Thomasin Mckenzie's performance, finding it the standout in the film. She has the potential to become one of the most talented actors from this generation in the coming years. Other performances were average; even Anne Hathaway, despite her screen time, didn't deliver an exceptional performance.Despite the initial good casting and the suspenseful atmosphere, it's not enough to redeem a film when, at a crucial moment emphasizing the importance of the father figure, a murder occurs, and one of the most dramatic events is revealed. Eileen's random escape and the relieved expression placed on her face at the end felt like undermining the significance of the development I mentioned. This sensation significantly lowered my rating, as the film had potential in various aspects.In short, it's a wasted film. I always say the ending of a film is one of its most impactful aspects. If a film is bad, it can redeem itself with a strong ending; if it's good, the ending can make it legendary; if it's average, the ending can elevate the overall feeling. It requires a well-crafted screenplay, and I don't think this screenplay achieved that. The costumes and atmosphere make it watchable, but not much more."
tt8097030,5.0,"This is the first Disney Pixar movie that I felt wasn't made for me whilst I was watching it. Their films usually have something for everyone and a very broad appeal.I felt like this film was aimed squarely at young female TikTok users going through hormonal changes.It has some very important messages that I'm glad to see getting some attention, but it was also very derivative and borrowed a lot of elements from a lot of other kids movies."
tt8097030,6.0,"This is a story about a girl who turns into a big Red panda.The animation is fresh with a scent of manga about it, the characters are pretty interesting and all in all this a solid enough movie.I think a younger audience will like it and there is lots of relevant stuff for young people.Looking back over the Pixar catalogue there is a dizzying choice of absolute classics that are loved by children and adults alike.Many took really big choices like opening with a tragic death, including a full length music video or excluding dialogue for the entire opening act.Pixar couldn't possibly keep this up forever and Turning Red shows signs they are running out of steam.This takes no risks and is happy just being a kids film about a big fluffy creature.The scenes with the Panda are relatively rare and after a few incidents everyone accepts the Red Panda and that embarrassment factor is removed diminishing the aliment.The story shies away from any kind of conflict. Making it very soft and friendly - happily rolling around in themes of friendship and individuality - but removes any kind of tension.The mother starts as a great character but the story can't stomach her overbearing nature for long and soon it is apparent that everyone is right and the things that were held as important really never mattered, everything works out and everyone agrees to disagree without any consequence.This is all very nice and friendly; younger people of a milder disposition will love this.As an adult it made the experience feel quite empty and pointless - I have a feeling this isn't going to stick long with a younger audience either.Perhaps this is aimed at a eastern audience where perhaps it resonates better.Nothing bad here but if I was to watch all the Pixar movies again this would be way down the bottom of the list.*EDIT* my 8 year old grand daughter has since watched this and she loved it. When I asked what she liked most about the movie she said ""the big fluffy panda"" - She seemed a bit sketchy on what the actual plot was but she is a girl who knows what she wants and fluffy panda's is it - so a 9/10 from her."

I didn't feel a connection to any of the characters besides Barry, the others were glossed over and kind of just there for background and easter eggs. It all went very slow at first and then so fast it was hard to keep up.Compared to the Bruce Timm glory years of DC animation, this new art style is medicore, mass produced commercial art, devoid of any charm or uniqueness. Bland and boring, and not very well animated either.Honestly, how many times did we need to see Green Arrow shoot a totally ineffectual arrow and then dodge out of the way of the enemies return fire?"
tt29195117,6.0,"One of few in the recent lines of the Tomorrowverse animated original films, as a long time fan of DC and love Marv Wolfmans George Perez work, I honestly haven't been much of a fan of these newer films they've put out recently, firstly the art style, not a fan of the Archer Artstyle, it doesnt feel like a DC original animated movie, wish they go back to that death & reign of Superman to JLD war and young justice art style that defined the DC original animated movies & DC animation for a long time - -wish you guys at DC WB would go back to that! The archer style sucks for dc, it's pretty average. Once you get 50 mins to 1 hour into it the film starts focusing on what the titles about, they made numerous changes from Wolfman and Perez's book, some good the Barry Allen centric focus was a nice touch, some changes unnecessary. 6/10 slow burn."
tt29195117,6.0,"An uninterestingly useless, too mild of a 'Crisis on...' DC animation. It's like a walk in a park with 85 years olds, even though many of them look young. The screenplay is not interesting, like an old photo album, the animation is so so, unthrilling, the visual effects just bear the name of visual effects, the score is good actually and better than the rest along with the voice-overs which at times is like the actors are on Valium while reading their lines.It would have been so much better to have the two parts fused in one ""hell"" of a production with smooth ""joints"" and continuity and only then would it have gathered a 7+ to 8+ .Screenplay/storyline/plots: 6Development: 8Realism: 5.5Entertainment: 4.5Voice: 7Animation/filming: 6.5VFX: 7Music/score/sound: 6.5Depth: 5Logic: 2Flow: 4.5Animation/action/adventure: 5Ending: 6."

Could have been a great thing but it lacks of style, flow, drama and intention. If only they would have improved DC studios characteristic drawing and style they could have come up with something better. Moreover lacking of a cinematographic universe to rely on or to defend such poor work.

As with the previous film, it starts without any clue as to what's happening and just continues like that for quite a bit.From there, we get bits & pieces of explanation, and then mess. And then a bit more explaining. And then mess.The first 30 minutes keeps this tediousness going so much that it feels like an eternity before any sense of cohesiveness comes through.As an ending of the ""Tomorrowverse"", it feels completely lackluster, especially taking into account the horridness of Warworld into this movie. Plus (spoiler alert), having Constantine being Paraiah seems very cheap."
tt0285175,6.0,"Allison Lang (Anne Hathaway) is from the upper class white neighborhood of Pacific Palisades. Her parents (Michael Biehn, Laura San Giacomo) are divorced and she's not connecting with them. Her boyfriend Toby is a Wigger and a poser. He takes her and her friend Emily (Bijou Phillips) to the bad side of L.A. They try to buy drugs and get rolled by Hector (Freddy Rodríguez). Even with Toby's cowardice, she is excited by the incident and returns to the spot the next night with Emily, Amanda (Shiri Appleby) and Sasha (Alexis Dziena). She finds Hector again as she falls further and further into his dangerous world.This is a souped-up afterschool special. I don't particularly find these characters that compelling. The girls could do whatever the hell they want for all I care. It starts with the idiotic posing from Toby. It brings up an interesting casting choice. It's crazy looking back that Mike Vogel got the bigger role while Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Channing Tatum are cast as his friends. The other problematic casting choice is Freddy Rodríguez. I can't buy him as a gang leader especially since he's a foot shorter than Anne Hathaway. He's definitely not hard enough and there's a bit of Napoleon going on here. Hathaway is good in this movie and keeps it compelling. She's really the major bright spot in this."
tt0285175,5.0,"This movie was often times painful to watch, and it's not because of its ""moving"" subject matter. It's possible the filmmakers aren't at fault, here, because when you make a movie about irritating people, don't be surprised that the viewers will find themselves irritated. But if you take on a film that'll make people's brains hemorrhage, you probably deserve to be booed.Honestly, though, after seeing this piece of crap, I'm surprised Stephen Gaghan can still get work in Hollywood. Likewise for Hathaway, who does a respectable job with a vastly mundane script. Not so kudos to Bijou Philips, for whom playing trash isn't exactly a huge stretch or test of acting ability, nor to Freddy Rodriguez, who, to make his speech more threatening, actually slows himself down so much that he starts. Speaking. In. Fragments. Of the trio, though, he may be the most surprising transformation, especially since he's so squeaky on ""Six Feet Under."" It was unexpected, but it may have been a casting mistake. Instead of appearing threatening, he looks more like he has Short Man's Syndrome, since Hathaway has a head of height on him, and may appear more menacing therefore. I know I shouldn't be so astounded, but it stupefies me still, how far Hollywood will go to make the worst casting decisions in the name of getting someone proximately famous for the DVD cover. Oy...I think the most irksome thing about ""Havoc"" is that, in the end, it's a vacuous morality tale. They had a chance to make something of the examination of bored, rich teenagers who want to be poor on purpose, but they instead glazed over it. No one involved has long-lasting suffering. It's like the whole thing was just a bad dream, which is, I suppose, a fitting description of a night spent watching ""Havoc,"" a most aptly-titled film. The most disappointing aspect of the whole deal is that the personal responsibility lesson isn't given enough gravity. Bored, unlikable, upper-class adolescents get in a wee bit of trouble with a Latin gang of their own accord? My cup overfloweth. Honest to God, if I have to hear another person defend an individual's actions on the basis of the ""It's only your fault until you get hurt; then, you can blame someone else"" line, I'm going to implode. And guess what ""Havoc"" does? Bottom line: if you're looking for half-naked girls, you've hit the jackpot. Also, if you're a teenager and you're looking for some kind of searing expose of the ""Gee, I think I'll go join a gang today"" lifestyle, you, too, are in luck. Otherwise, don't be surprised if you find yourself vomiting uncontrollably and crying for your mother during the ninety minutes of the train wreck called ""Havoc."""
tt0285175,5.0,"Negative comments about this film need to be tempered by the sad story surrounding its making. The script was written by a 17-year old girl named Jessica Kaplan. No, It's not Citizen Kane, but it is an extraordinary piece of work for a teenager. And most sadly, she perished in an airplane crash at the age of 21. The film is dedicated to her memory.As to the film's merits, it is by my count the 1,464th variation of Rebel Without A Cause, which I think said all that needed to be said on the subject. Did you know that adolescents often find society empty and pointless? And that they do stupid things by way of rebelling against it, in hopes of dispelling their angst and finding something more meaningful? Yes, it's true. In this version of that old chestnut, the rebels are a particularly spoiled group of high school students living in Hollywood. To find something they consider ""real"", they form youth gangs in imitation of the poor folk in East L.A. And then they actually go there, at first to buy drugs; but then rich girls Anne Hatahway and Bijou Phillips try to get involved in the local Hispanic gang scene. Some pretty modest mayhem ensues.The East L.A. people are awfully sanitized and not very believable. Nobody is addicted to anything. Nobody is desperate. Nobody appears to be poor. These are basically solid middle class folk, devoted to family, who have a few surface quirks and who happen to sell crack cocaine instead of, say, life insurance.Is it my imagination or does the gorgeous Bijou Phillips always play exactly the same role -- a sexually eager girl who gets in over her head, discovering the hard way that yes, she has limits? That's the role she plays here, and she is fine (as is lead Anne Hatahway). But I wonder whether that is her entire repertoire. Perhaps she will branch out someday.Somewhere on this planet, there must be some group of people more deserving of sympathy than affluent Hollywood teenagers. So I found myself wondering why this film had been made. The young scriptwriter should not be held accountable, but you would think older people would know better."
tt0285175,6.0,"I could start off this review in Singlish by saying ""This movie damn havoc"", and it just about sums it up accurately and nicely. Sex, drugs and gangsterism from the hop is hip culture, this movie attempts to provide a social commentary about the lives of super rich teenagers in the Palasades, wasting their bored lives away by trying to emulate another culture they think is cool, the wannabes who chose not to conform to the norms, but try their darndest best to be one in the 'hood.Anne Hathaway assumes the lead role as Allison Lang, a wide-eyed teenager whose language is as beautiful as her appearance. Having her material needs satisfied by her ultra rich parents, but living in essentially an empty home, her friends and her seek out the alternative lifestyle which promises loads of fun and excitement - drugs, drink and fights. Being associated with a gang brings about some perceived self esteem and self worth. But where do you draw the line when you're always seeking another high moment? A journey to ""downtown"" - the areas of the have-nots, where seedy bogeymen reside in, areas where parents warn their children to stay away from, sparks a discovery of a wonderland for Allison and her best friend Emily (Bijou Phillips), as they make repeated trips to be amongst the real boys in the 'hood, to hang out, chill, and do whatever them wannabes have done at a magnitude of 10. It's a primal attraction and sexual tension between the girls and the men (not the boys they hang out with, who pee in their pants when faced with real danger - acting cool is not cool), and between Allison and Hector (Freddy Rodriguez).But like all revelations, sometimes it takes the hard way to learn a lesson, and the movie picked up on this rather rapidly in the last third, once they got enticed into playing a game of dice (with sexual connotations) in order to be initiated into Hector's gang. Basically, the audience observes the attraction of an alternative lifestyle, of wannabes thinking they can handle it all, and of redemption and change.While it was a surprise to see Michael Biehn in the movie, the movie clearly belonged to Anne Hathaway in her very first attempt to break away from her goody-two-shoes roles like in the Princess Diaries and Ella Enchanted. However, with the M18 rating here, this movie suffered cuts where it really mattered, and a poor edit too at one of the more pivotal scenes which literally screwed up the understanding of what actually happened, only to be told at face value, suggesting the ""truth"" of the matter, at a later stage. Sometimes I wonder why not release it as R21, and keep the film intact. Surely Hathaway has fans, but to mutilate the movie to let them in, is a bad decision.It's peculiar to have the movie released this week, up against Singer's SUperman. Maybe some rebellious bored teenagers happen to be the answer to balance the truth and justice that the last son of Krypton embodies?"
tt0285175,6.0,"Havoc (2005) The Shadow of Sixteen Candles., 16 June 2006*** This comment may contain spoilers ***A lot of people seem not to have enjoyed this film very much. I'm not sure why. Yes, the rich girls seemed phony but lots of teenage girls sound similar in their speech. It comes across as so stylized as to be stilted, yet it's a genuine parole. It's the way some people speak in real life.The acting wasn't that bad either. The only major flaw in the story is that Ann Hathaway didn't take her clothes off more often. Just kidding. I've never seen her in any of the Disney epics so was deprived of the enjoyment of having any pedophilic fantasies fulfilled. She's the best looking of the bunch, in a conventional way, and she handles the part like a pro.The story, alas, is the weakest part of the film. It isn't just that the rich kids are stereotypically bored. I imagine boredom among the very rich can be a serious problem. When you have everything material that you need, it's hard to glom onto a goal other than momentary pleasure. And it isn't just that the Latinos we see are a horde of overmuscled greaseballs who feel only contempt for the ""white girls"" and who sell dope and whose bodies are adorned with elaborate tattoos.It's that the dialog doesn't always ring true. Some Pachuco punk who has gang banged her and her friend comes up with something like, ""Who are you? You not real. Not REALLY real. You a fake."" And so on. The guy sounds like he's studied with Fritz Perls.And yet the movie is an attempt to answer an interesting question and perhaps only a happily middle-class female director could have handled it this well. The question is: What is it about lower-class men that attracts upper-class women? In my experience black men have far more of this mojo than Latinos, but okay. The attraction extends to gangstas in prison, even those who will never be released. Are such men perceived by such women as imbued with some feral sexual power? Are women driven to them by impulses like those that put men behind the wheels of racing cars? Is it self-testing? Is there an adrenalin rush involved in seeing if a rogue male can be brought under rein, like a wild stallion? I don't know. I'm just asking. I'm not aware of any professional research on the subject but it's a fascinating one."
tt0285175,5.0,"After reading the comments for this movie, I had a strong urge to see it. To be honest, it seemed like a bit of a pot boiler, though I was surprised when I found out it was penned by the same writer that gave us Syriana and Traffic. What I really liked about this film was what lied beneath its surface, even if that seed wasn't brought to fruition for a number of reasons. What I thought the film truly attempted to explore was the membrane between cultures that has become permeable in today's media-saturated environment, or more specifically, the access granted to those with the means to appropriate what has become a stylized version of ghetto culture. It is one of the more fascinating reversals in contemporary culture made possible only by the media explosion : the cultural performance of a sort of ""ghetto aesthetic"" by white suburban youth, whose participation in that aesthetic is one of choice, rather than of necessity, as it could possibly be said is true of those who must actually navigate the ghetto. I appreciate the effort on the part of Gaghan to explore this cultural phenomenon, but unfortunately, he and his collaborators fell short of their endeavor in more than one area.For one, and I imagine many would agree, the choice of Anne Hathaway as the lead was particularly disastrous, and not because of her association to more wholesome films, but because she simply did not have the capacity as an actress to perform this role. Secondly, the performance of the PLC actors was fairly laughable, though the blame must be placed on the scriptwriters for this one. The characters switched too freely from their ""thug"" personae to their ""authentic"" (if that word is appropriate) suburban personae. The filmmakers truly cut their own feet out from under them and missed the point: white teenagers immersed in this sort of cultural performance are usually far more invested in their own individual performances, and thus, would not be likely to slip so freely between identities. That they were able to do so betrayed the fact that the teenagers were aware that they were in fact performing, rendering the characters unbelievable and blunting the point of the film. But the film's true failure was in its mind-boggling refusal to prioritize the subject matter above the personal struggle of the protagonist, which comes off as pretty flimsy. If the filmmakers really wanted to explore the interplay between cultures and the consequences of that interaction as the result of our media-saturated environment, there really should not have relied on such an antiquated notion of a central protagonist. It's just not that kind of movie (or shouldn't have been). Gaghan did a stunning job of elevating his subject-matter in Traffic and Syriana, which leaves me with the sinking sensation that there might have been some studio intervention on this one. In the end, Havoc is stifled by the centrality of Allison's moral dilemma. What is far more interesting is the implications of this threshold - both figurative and literal - that has been opened in contemporary American society. Havoc's endeavor is a bold one in exploring a sojourn between cultures not just in a circumscribed sense wherein suburban teens take part in a cultural performance within the confines of their own environment mediated by digital medium, but in a real world scenario. The most poignant moments occur within this awkward zone of interaction, and much of the praise can be placed on Johnny Vasquez: the scene where he explains that East Los Angeles is a place where ""people live,"" rather than a vacuum of nightly news reported crime. Perhaps the most searing line occurs after the contentious ""rape"" scene in which Manuel asks Allison, ""What did you want?"", alerting her that this experience is not within the locus of control usually allotted her as the result of her white privilege. An ""authentic"" experience is inherently alien to her, and experiencing the alien is rarely comforting. Such interaction carries the weight of victimization for both parties - Allison and Emily for whom the sexual taboos are too great a hurtle to jump, and Manuel, who suffers the consequences of Emily's attempt to grasp at some sense of control and to cover up the shame that she feels following the sexual interlude. This double victimization is something that is overlooked in the was-it or was-it-not arguments over the sex scene, which is unfortunate, because the point of the film, although poorly articulated, can be found in the aftermath of that scene."
tt0285175,6.0,"A group of bored teenagers coming from rich families in Los Angeles discover the style most black inner city kids practice. Some of them, especially the young men, even go as far as sporting the clothing worn by the people they are imitating. Two girls, Allison and Emily, on the other hand, are more daring without a need for adopting the fashions when the hang out. Sam and Eric, who are the leaders of the school gang, decide to explore East Los Angeles, a neighborhood in which the Hispanics are a majority. The teenagers, accompanied by Allison and Emily, decide to buy drugs from a street gang called '16'. The meeting ends up badly, as the Mexicans cheat the suburban kids. Allison, who earlier has spoken about how bored she really is, finds the excitement she yearns to have in her sheltered life.All these aimless youths have one thing in common, they come from dysfunctional families with money, where a parent figure is always absent. Allison invites more trouble when she decides to explore that world, totally dominated by Hector. Allison, having sold the idea of joining the gang to Emily, decide to go to Hector's turf. The thrill of entering that territory will end badly, as Emily, the weakest of the duo, suffers a shock of her life. In the end, there will be a confrontation heard, but not seen that serves as a sobering reminder the two worlds could not blend easily.Barbara Kopple, the award winning documentary director, tried her hand with this film that juxtaposes two cultures that are as far as night and day. The rich life in Pacific Palisades will never accept the less privileged people of East Los Angeles. The film is a sort of parable in how the bored teens of the richer suburbs want to experience the real world they only love to imitate. Ms. Kopple uses a device she is quite familiar with, the young man that is seen interviewing his peers in search of answers which are never too clear.Anne Hathaway surprises with her daring performance. Usually seen in good girl roles, her Allison is quite a departure for her. She showed courage in accepting a role that was totally the opposite of what we knew of her screen persona. Freddy Rodriguez is also good as Hector, the boy that prefers to stay within his own territory. Bijou Phillips plays Emily. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Matt O'Leary do a good job of imitating the black kids they would like to impersonate. Laura San Giacomo and Michael Biehn are seen briefly as Allison's parents."
tt0285175,6.0,"A slice-of-life about privileged, bored, hedonistic white kids who want a taste of street/gang life but get more than they bargained for is clichéd movie material by now, and ""Havoc"" is too short to develop the theme with much depth, but it has a harsh immediacy that probably comes from director Barbara Kopple's documentary background, and you can't take your eyes off it for a second. Anne Hathaway lets it all out (literally) in her breakthrough adult performance, and she is incredibly sexy. **1/2 out of 4."
tt1723121,6.0,"The idea behind this movie is nothing really new. It's a road trip, this time to Mexico. A small time drug dealer, David, owes his supplier. In order to pay the debt, he must deliver a shipment of drugs from Mexico to the US. He ""hires"" a family to help him to seem less suspicious. They get the drugs then hi-jinx ensues. Of course, they are chased, there's some poll dancing, a huge spider, a lesson on kissing.All of it was amusing and it was one of Jennifer Aniston's better comedic roles. Kenny was the funniest character, with his naivety and shocked that he wasn't getting paid.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, decent for a light weight comedy."
tt1723121,5.0,"""This is not a smidge of pot! You got me moving enough weed to kill Willie Nelson, man!""We're the Millers is a raunchy comedy with some funny moments. It's an entertaining movie, but ultimately the script felt a bit lazy. The premise and the cast promised more, but director Rawson Marshall Thurber uses jokes and gags we've seen in other comedies. I did laugh at several scenes and there were some great lines, but I can't just judge a comedy based on that because usually I will laugh at anything. You know there is a problem with a comedy when all the audience laughs more during the end credits in the blooper reals than during the entire film. There are some awkward and uncomfortable scenes as well, and I didn't like the fact that they made all the lovable families look uncool and act as dorks in this film. Jason Sudeikis is a great actor and I would love to see him starring in more comedies. He has great comedic timing and delivers his lines with a perfect precision. Jennifer Aniston is also a very likable actress despite the fact that she really hasn't made a great film, but there is something about her that draws the audience. Will Poulter was the star of this film as he had the funniest scenes. He didn't have to say much, his facial expression alone was hilarious. This is the first comedy I've seen him in, although he did have some funny scenes in the last Narnia movie. Emma Roberts was probably the weakest link in this film, but I wouldn't blame her because her character was the least developed in the film. Ed Helms was a big disappointment for me here, his performance was way over the top, but Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation) was effortlesly hilarious. I was a huge fan of Thurber's earlier film, Dodgeball (perhaps one of the few people who enjoyed that movie), but I can't give him a passing grade for this movie although I didn't have a bad time either.David (Jason Sudeikis) is a low profile pot dealer who receives his supplies from Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms). After getting robbed during a deal, Brad forces him to go to Mexico and bring back his latest marihuana shipment in order to pay his debt. Being a small dealer David has no idea how to cross the border as he realizes the consequences his actions may have. He believes that the best way to cross the border safely will be pretending he is on a family trip. The only problem is that he is single so he gets a local stripper named Rose (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend she is his wife, a streetwise angry teen named Casey (Emma Roberts), and his kind hearted neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) to pretend they are his kids. He plans on getting across the border without problems by driving his apparently wonderful family on their big RV.The funniest scene in the movie happened during the final credits, but I also though there were some funny moments here and there, like when Kenny realizes that David is paying Rose and Casey to come along with him, or when Kenny gets bit by a spider. I also enjoyed some of the pop cultural references like when David thought he was going to be killed because of the plastic he was standing on claiming to know what it means because he has watched Dexter. The cameo with Luis Guzman was pretty funny as well. Those were some of the silly moments, but nothing that stood out or that I will probably remember tomorrow. The film is predictable and you know where it is heading, but it still is an enjoyable movie."
tt10304142,6.0,"Amsterdam comes roaring out of the gate with a fast-paced, quirky, charming, and unique mystery of the likes of Sherlock Holmes or Knives Out. The list of celebrities and actors continues to grow as almost every face in this movie is another a-lister making an entertaining appearance. I was so excited to see what happened next and was surprised when the story suddenly screeched to a halt for a very long slow flashback that didn't offer much to the plot. I hoped the exciting pace would return when the story returned to its original narrative, but the risk and urgency had been replaced by a scattered collection of arbitrary dialogue and scenes that lingered much longer than needed. The pacing lagged almost an hour before ramping back up in the final act. Amsterdam had so much potential but floundered in its attempts to be different and unique. The film's best part was Michael Shannon and Mike Myers' quirky bird-loving spies. Every time they were on the screen, I couldn't help but laugh. Christian Bale logged another amazing performance, as expected. But even with entertaining characters, great performances, and an exciting opening and conclusion, Amsterdam fumbled all its fantastic elements and ended up making my eyes heavy and my heart yearn to go to bed early."
tt10304142,6.0,"This movie is a bit long at over 2 hours but is written, acted, and directed in a style that is interesting all the way. There is quirkiness, sometimes it reminded me of Wes Anderson's movies, like ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" The character played by Christian Bale, a disheveled doctor who lost an eye in the war, reminded us of Peter Faulk's 1970s TV series Columbo in his mannerisms and his quest to find out facts.While this is almost entirely a fictional story it is loosely based on something that was called ""The Business Plot."" Roosevelt was newly elected and a group of businessmen didn't like the direction things were headed. So they hatched a plan to overthrow the President.But very little of the running time is actually devoted to that, most of it has the three main characters, accused of murdering a woman by pushing her into the street to be run over by a delivery truck, working to prove their innocence and to focus in on the real bad actors.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library, a totally interesting and entertaining take on the times."
tt10304142,5.0,"I had some hopes for Amsterdam. It sounded unique, edgy and boasted a well known cast. But I was very disappointed. Amsterdam is a train wreck of a film. It never really takes off. It is poorly put together. The pacing is bad and it has no logical sequence to it. It is a chore to watch this film as it is ridiculously long and for the most part barely covers any ground. There is difficulty to piece together what on earth is going on. I feel there might have been a good story here but it was so badly told and adapted that it falls absolutely flat.The worst film I have seen in 2023. I am so glad I did not waste money watching this in the cinema. I am sad however for the time that got wasted watching this disaster of a film."
tt10304142,5.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes no matter how hard we try to like a movie, it simply doesn't work for us. In those instances, I typically attempt to focus on what I did like and offer an explanation of why it fell short of expectations. And it's that word, ""expectations"", that is usually the culprit. High expectations often lead to disappointment, whereas 'low' or 'no' expectations at least have a shot of ending up a pleasant surprise. So when the writer-director of SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012) and THE FIGHTER (2010) rolls out his first film in seven years, and his cast is filled with Oscar winners, Oscar nominees, and other talented actors ... well, high expectations are in order. Unfortunately, so is the disappointment.David O Russell is the filmmaker noted above, and despite some disturbing accusations made against him recently, his cinematic track record and ability to attract deep and talented casts and crews make his new project something to check out. This one is inspired by the true story of a1933 political conspiracy, and that's where the story begins before flashing back to 1918 and ultimately returning to 1933. It's during the flashback where we see the beginnings of the friendship between Burt Berendsen (Oscar winner Christian Bale) and Harold Woodman (John David Washington). It's here that we also witness the presence of racism in the military during the Great War. When Burt and Harold are injured, they are cared for by nurse Valerie Voze (Margot Robbie). Harold and Valerie fall in love, and third wheel Burt joins them as a roommate in Amsterdam, where they live a blissful bohemian existence ... right up until Burt returns home to his wife and Valerie vanishes.Returning to 1933, we find Burt is a doctor experimenting with multiple medical options focused on injured war veterans, and Harold is a distinguished lawyer. Burt has a scarred face and glass eye from his war injuries, and Harold has been contacted by the daughter (Taylor Swift) of their former commanding officer (Ed Begley Jr). The daughter suspects foul play in the death of her father, who was scheduled to give a speech at an upcoming military reunion gala. Ms. Swift's appearance is in fact swift, and leads to the murder and scandalous autopsy findings.Going through all that happens next would be as convoluted on paper as it was on screen. There are so many characters and so many story lines and so many familiar faces that the film couldn't possibly be expected to flow smoothly. And it doesn't. A mention of some of the supporting cast includes standout Anya Taylor-Joy as the wife of filthy rich Tom Voze played by (Oscar winner) Rami Malek. When the murder occurs, Burt and Harold are the prime suspects of the detectives played by Matthias Schoenaerts and Alessandro Nivola. Andrea Riseborough plays Burt's estranged and ultra-snobby wife Beatrice, while Chris Rock is another old war buddy of our wrongfully accused murder suspects. Robert DeNiro (another Oscar winner) plays General Gil Dillenbeck (who we learn is based on real life Major General Smedley Butler). Others making an appearance include: Michael Shannon and Mike Myers as American and British spies, Timothy Olyphant as an undefined henchman, Zoe Saldana as the autopsy nurse, and the always dependable Colleen Camp and Beth Grant. Now you understand what I mean by so many characters and familiar faces.All of the actors are as strong as you would expect. Mr. Bale and Ms. Robbie go ""big"", while Mr. Washington stays in a low-key mode for balance. The film has an unusual look through the camera of 3-time Oscar winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, and seems to be filled with an endless stream of close-ups shot upward at the subject's face. It's not a whodunnit since we see the crime happen, and instead is more of a ""we must solve the case to avoid prison"" - kind of a quasi-comedy caper film, only they aren't trying to get away with anything. It's also not quite a farce, and is a madcap with a shortage of ""mad"". We see the power play between various factions that catches the unsuspecting types in the crosshairs, while raising points of fascism, antisemitism, and racism. The film meanders when it's not downright choppy, and it often plays like a scripted series trying too hard to appear improvisational. I believe the message is the power of friendship and love wins over the lust for power, however it's hard to know for sure. Drake as an Executive Producer adds an element of interest, but as a movie, this one mostly falls flat despite the efforts of a sterling cast.Opens in theaters on October 7, 2022."
tt10304142,5.0,"A quirky genre-bending caper with a political bent seems right up David O. Russell's alley. Unfortunately, this movie just never gels. At all. It feels like 10 different movies with 10 different casts, even if those casts are flat out jaw-dropping. I enjoyed some of those movies more than others (e.g. The farcical scenes when Russell pretended to be Wes Anderson), but every time I started getting interested in a plot or enjoying a performance, the whole thing swerved. And more often than not it served right off the road.Also, was Bale doing a Peter Falk impersonation? I kept waiting for him to light a cigar and say, ""Just one more thing..."""
tt10304142,5.0,"AmsterdamThis strange movie was riddled with problems from the start, the plot was predicated on mystery men in the background pulling the strings of society through wealth and privilege for whatever nefarious reason all to be revealed at the denouement, an outcome we had all guessed long since!What occupied the main body of the movie were either anarchic and incomprehensible contrivances that were meant to be funny, however I didn't laugh once, medical procedures of the most graphic variety, and strange stilted dialogue between the protagonists. There was just no chemistry between the three ""inseparable friends"" that took the leads.With an almost entirely black cast there was a bizarre thread of racism/outcast/underclass running throughout the movie, it was quite inexplicable.My main concern is two fold, the under utilisation of some truly first class acting talent and the terrible editing that led to a lumbering and patchy narrative flow. The movie was 25 minutes too long.To my mind this movie did not need to be made and overall it flopped at the box office costing 80 million to make and grossing only 15 million overall in the US......ouch!I am struggling to give this 5 outta 10 and I remembering avoiding watching this in Cineworld after the terrible reviews."
tt10838180,5.0,"I've been waiting for this one with anticipation and I was thoroughly disappointed. I spent the first 40 minutes wondering what was going on. It was barely coherent. The rest of the movie got slightly better. But there was no real story. Some parts were enjoyable. Some weren't. But, at the end, I didn't feel like my day had been enriched by watching it and I have no desire to watch it again. The original Matrix, on the other hand, I still watch that at least once a year. This movie was done strictly as a money grab. There was no real story to tell and no journey to follow. I don't recommend it!"
tt10838180,6.0,"Aside from the action scenes and a few throwback moments, this film is a misfire on many levels. It just doesn't have the feel of a Matrix film at all. Just some cool visual effects, decent action and a bit of uniqueness is what this unnecessary sequel is watchable for one time.It's not boring but also doesn't justify the length. The sad part is, the non-action or the dialogue parts don't have any excitement or energy at all. Watching them is almost a chore, while the action set-pieces hold your attention with the style and presentation. The actors did good, and that's something I can't deny.All in all, this feels more like a direct-to-video sequel made to cash in on the original franchise. Resurrections isn't really bad: it's watchable, but has its limitations. Keep your expectations in check before you watch this and you might find a good time-pass action flick for the evening. That's all there is to it. The Matrix should have stayed a trilogy, but a new film is welcome for a singular viewing experience nonetheless."
tt10838180,5.0,"Agent smith says things like OMG and robot sentinels give fist bumps now. Though failing to capture the magic of the first movie, I could appreciate the other sequels for trying to expand the universe and keeping the same tone. This one purposely makes a mockery of itself and calls it self awareness. I'll stick with watching the first one only for now on."
tt19984386,6.0,"Two bits of trivia for you. 1. Ian McShane is one of those rare actors who has never given a bad performance. 2. The Canary Islands are, geologically, not islands but mountain tops. Once, long ago, when sea levels were lower, there was a civilization there. The reason for this trivia? Although McShane has never given a bad performance, he does occasionally take parts that are less than his due. Arguably, this is one of them. And, two, unless you succumb to the hypnotic delight of chillin' on the island (and many of you will indeed succumb!), this meandering and moody film may not be for you. It is literally 10 full minutes before we have actual dialog. To say the pace is slow is like saying water is wet. There is indeed some action in the Third Dramatic Act but, in all honesty, by then you will have absolutely decided whether or not this film is for you. And voted, accordingly, with your keyboard.

tt0112697,6.0,"Silky-smooth, vanilla-coated pleasure about matchmaking in modern-day high school. Far from the insufferable smugness of all those '80s teen-flicks, ""Clueless"" is bright--in both senses of the word--clever, funny, fanciful and yet grounded in reality (a rich one). Alicia Silverstone is adorable, but the supporting cast is affable and seemingly carefully-picked (they all get their share of funny lines, particularly Dan Hedaya superb as Silverstone's father). Seems more inspired by Jane Austen's ""Emma"" than based upon it, with a few mean-spirited lines but plenty of lightly innocent laugh-getters. **1/2 from ****"
tt17663992,5.0,"Never thought I'd see another Scream movie after Wes Craven's passing, but here we are with the second film since and I gotta say, it was better when Wes was alive. Now, I'm not saying this isn't a competent film. It very much is and is enjoyable through most of the runtime, dodgy acting aside, which was also a problem in number 5. But this new team can't come up with a good twist to save their lives. Saw the ending coming a mile away, same as the last one, and when it hits, you can't help but to feel let down. The logic that you have to throw out the window to believe this one is, well, illogical. I will say that the film is better than the previous one. There is no unimaginable deaths, like a 17 year old, 5 foot tall, skinny high school girl lifting a man twice her size. Thank goodness for that, because that is still hard to swallow for me. All the puzzle pieces fall into place quite nicely here, it's just fairly unbelieveable that the new crew, including old crew member, now FBI agent Kirby, had zero info on the culprits and had no idea about their intertwined past with the new crew. Kinda ridiculous. Other than that, it was a decent entry in what I hope is a dying franchise. This film just proved to me that there is not a whole lot left to do with the story and they are starting to slip when it comes to motives for their plotline. That and no Sydney Prescott is kind of a deal breaker. Even a cameo would've been nice, but we got nothing.2.5 butcher knives out of 5."
tt15268244,5.0,"Joy Ride is a comedy about four girls who take an unplanned trip.The movie has a solid plot that doesn't rely on just the comedy to get things going. Rather, it offers a lot of bonding moments between the girls, some moving and emotional moments when it came to finding the main lead's biological mother, and a nice character development for the lead. The individual storylines were interesting and entertaining as well.Also, the girls did a great job with their characters and their chemistry was undeniable.However, the comedy part was so so, often using the shocking factor to impress and some of the jokes were even over the top. But, overall, it was a fun ride."
tt15268244,5.0,"A not so funny comedy movie. At first I had high expectation but the script and some dialog are just weird and low class. Some of the characters are just stupid and unnecessary. Some of the acting was not that professional and ameture. I couldn't believe they even shot in China, Korea and even in Paris with such budget?I was happy to see another movie with Asian as main casts. But I wish they find a better script or storyline to showcase their acting skill. The content of this movie is just not solid and some of the supporting casts are just not ready for the Hollywood movies. Kind of disappointed."
tt15268244,6.0,Sorry guys word of mouth is going to be bad. There were plenty of walkouts during our sneak tonight. Jokes fell completely flat and you like you're in trouble when the audiences are dead silent during comedic moments.Sure there were some funny parts but the trailer made this out to be a Crazy Rich Asians meets Bridesmaids non stop laugh riot. Sabrina Wu was horrible. Her timing was terrible and made for some very uncomfortable moments.The reason Bridesmaids was a master class in comedy was it was hilarious and perfection from beginning to end. This was bottom of the barrel bad writing mixed with awkward performances that borderline unwatchable. I am embarrassed for some of the talent. If you must wait for stream.
tt9243804,5.0,"Despite one of the biggest divides in critical reception (critical acclaim) and audience reactions (much more polarising, with a large amount of strong dislike) of any film seen by me, 'The Green Knight' was still seen anyway on high recommendation from my sister. Also like Dev Patel, with him coming on a long way as an actor, and have liked David Lowery's other work. Especially 'The Old Man and the Gun'. The subject did fascinate me a good deal and have no problem with symbolism or slow pacing, have even in the past defended films with heavy symbolism and/or slow pacing.Somehow though, 'The Green Knight' was one of those difficult to rate and review films. Really wanted to like it, with how much it had going for it and how highly recommended it was, but it was wildly uneven. There are good things, and those good things are actually quite outstanding. There are also bad things, and a few of the bad things are worse than bad. Actually saw 'The Green Knight' last year, but it has taken a while for me to think over and adequately sum up what my thoughts were.'The Green Knight' does have good things. Cannot fault the acting, with Patel giving perhaps his best performance to date in full command of a strongly written role. Alicia Vikander is suitably enigmatic and 'The Borgias' Sean Harris makes the most of his short screen time. Did think that it started off great, very thought provoking and with a very haunting, creepy mood. The Green Knight is pretty frightening.Also cannot fault the production values, which are quite wonderful. Very handsome and atmospheric scenery enhanced by the vibrant yet also moody photography. The effects work shows a lot of professionalism and care. The music has a haunting ominous vibe and had no problem with how it was placed, also felt that it suited the tone of the story and didn't come over as too heavy.On the other hand, the story felt dully paced and over-extended, starting off with great promise but meanders about a lot in the second half. If you read any synopsis that indicates that a lot goes on, it didn't feel like it to me with a lot of scenes going on for too long, everything that happens post the battlefield sequence (which was well done) to the arrival at the Green Chapel feels like forever. Lowery directs with ambition but sometimes it was very more style than substance and show offy.Furthermore, the symbolism is very heavy handed and not easy to get the head round. Especially in the final act. Some interesting themes here, not dug into deeply or insightfully enough. The whole ending also felt confusing and it feels rather abrupt as well. Too much of the script is too rambling and there is not much fresh or insightful about it.In conclusion, very difficult to rate and review. 5/10."
tt9243804,6.0,"I really wanted to like this film, but other than the obvious care towards its execution, everything else is basically slow, pretentious, referencing stuff important to the writer/director and metaphorical. This is one of those movies that you have to research after watching it, trying to understand what it wanted to say. In short: a boy's rite of passage to becoming a man by facing his own death... stretched to more than two hours.It certainly helps to know the 14th century poem the film is based on, its various interpretations and associated folklore, including the French versions. Not ready to do that? Well, you're out of luck! Because the film is purposely vague, explaining nothing, making no sense and adding stuff from poems from the same era as filler. In short: Gawain was this noble and kind knight, unless you read the French versions where he was a total dick or the later rewrites which feature Lancelot as the top good guy.The film is slow, methodical, making you want to watch it at 1.5x speed, only you can't because you need to see every detail and divine its meaning. For example: King Arthur's coat has these little metal badges on it, which are references to previous projects of the writer/director and of other people in the team. What? You didn't get that while Arthur is walking around in a dark room and scenes are interspersed with scenes of Morgana Le Fay doing pagan magic? Well, I can't understand how, because the writer/director spent more than a year perfecting the scene until it was just right! And yes, I am sarcastic.The only reason why I rated this so high is because the sets were nice and the actors did great work. However, this is one of those obscure works that carry meaning only to the creator and can't possibly bring any joy at the first viewing. Do I care about old British folk lore and how the writer/director wanted to tell the story so I would research all of this and then rewatch the film so I can revel in the details? Hell, no!"
tt9243804,5.0,"I don't know what kind of drugs David Lowery took but it seems like that stuff was doing its job. The Green Knight is well filmed, I'll give them that, but the story itself is slow, making no sense for the majority of the time. It's just a weird movie, and normally that doesn't mean it's bad but in this case it was. The acting wasn't bad either so it wasn't their fault this whole movie was a mess. Apart of the good cinematography and the decent acting it's just not good. I wouldn't waste your time with this one if I were you."
tt9243804,6.0,"Liked the first half, disliked the second half. The alterations to the original story were in some ways intriguing, like including the story of St. Winifred whose fate echoes Gawain's, but in other cases, went too far off the rails. Some of the wild ideas that got included to pad the film out to 130 long minutes should have been excised.What is the green knight? Death, the green of the earth that will cover us all, the moss that will grow over our edifices when we're gone - I loved this interpretation. Facing the prospect of death with honor, resisting temptation - the basis for the original story may sound rather old-fashioned, but it's from the 14th century after all. Too many of the embellishments David Lowery made to the story - subplots, characters, hallucinations, etc - detracted from it, feeling at best inelegant and at worst pretentious. You certainly don't get the impression from the film that the story is about virtue or honor, and that's a shame. It started feeling like ambiguity for ambiguity's sake, which was irritating by the time the film ended.The cinematography certainly had its moments, but I prefer less CGI, less darkness, and a more realistic look even to fantasy stories, at least as much as possible. Aesthetically I had a very mixed reaction, and in any event, the lighthearted tone of the poem was completely lost here. Dev Patel is wonderful though."
tt9243804,5.0,"I'll start by saying that visually, this movie is stunning and it has some moments of great acting. That's about the extent of the positives. As an avid fan of A24, I was very excited for The Green Knight and tried to go into it with as open a mind as possible. I wasn't expecting a horror or action movie. I went in simply expecting to be told a story. I anticipated that it would be on the slower side, but wow. I feel so guilty for saying this seeing as so many people loved the film, but it was way too boring for me to enjoy. I have loved the slow-burn approach that A24 has taken with other movies like The Witch and The Lighthouse, but The Green Knight just didn't have enough substance to keep me engaged in what was going on. Every time something significant seemed to happen, it would be followed by an agonizingly long shot of a forest with loud, eerie music playing over it. Furthermore, this movie is DARK. Like literally dark. I couldn't see who was on the screen or what was happening for at least 30% of the movie. As for the other 70% that I could actually see, I had literally no idea what was going on. What's the meaning of those giant gray naked people? Why did everyone want to kiss Dev Patel? Beats me. Maybe that's my fault because i'm not very familiar with the story of Gawain and the Green Knight, but I consider myself a generally thoughtful person who makes an effort to understand complex films. I spent the entire drive home mentally analyzing this movie and still had no idea what any of it meant until I read some online articles explaining the story. I really wanted to love this movie and I wish I could understand why it is receiving such praise, but both my friend and I left the theater feeling very underwhelmed and sleepy. I've also noticed that a lot of these rave reviews are coming from people who are likely pretentious arthouse film lovers who somehow think they are better than everyone else, since they all seem to think that anyone who didn't enjoy this movie is ultimately ""unintelligent"". As one review states, ""all negative reviews are from people who should have stayed home with a bud light and watched South Park"". Well I hate both South Park and beer and still found this film boring, as did the four or so people who walked out of my theater."
tt9243804,5.0,"The Green Knight is an adaptation of the story, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Gawain(Dev Patel) goes on an adventure, to fulfill his destiny with the Green Knight(Ralph Ineson).The Green Knight is a mediocre film. Director David Lowery has given us an extremely dull & dragging movie, that is just filled with ambiguity. Maybe viewers have to read the source material to truly enjoy this film. The cinematography by Andrew Droz Palermo is breathtaking & is the only strong point of the movie. Dev Patel is good as Gawain. Alicia Vikander is awesome as Essel/The Lady. Ralph Ineson is effective as the Green Knight. The supporting cast is impressive. The Green Knight is not worth a watch. Watch it, only if you want to get bored out of your mind."
tt9243804,5.0,"While I have to give credit for the amazing cinematography and set disigns. Overall this movie was kinda a letdown. I already knew the 14th centrury story, and I kinda expected they would do more with it. What we're left with is a film much like 'Macbeth' (2015). Well made but not that interesting of a story.5/10: yes, but no."
tt9224104,6.0,"Personally, I was surprised that Jason Statham decided to make a sequel to the Meg. Most likely because I did not think the Meg was his type of movie. Not exactly Crank on water or anything. The film is an obvious cash cow but worth the money. No need to put any thought into how stupid this movie its cause it's met to be the opposite of smart. Its entertaining as hell and does not slow down long enough for me to point out the plot holes and the science mistakes. A perfect Tie-in to Shark Week.

Just like the first, if you're prepared for a bit of outrageous, over the top action, then this may just be the summer pick me up that you need.This time it's not just The Megs that represent a threat, expect a few surprises along the way, but man's greed is arguably the main villain that Jonas has to battle with.The usual mix of action and special effects, if you thought the first one lacked subtlety, this one rips up the rule book, it's outrageous, big sharks, and plenty of opportunity for Statham to do his thing.It's not easy to pick out the characters that are solely here as cannon fodder, but in fairness it's not shy about bumping off the cast.I think this film has been lost among Barbenheimer, and that's a shame, it was a fun watch. Maybe The huge Chinese market will ensure a third film follows in the future.Best of all, Pipin is back!6/10."

tt1041829,6.0,"Well, if I could split the movie into two, I would say that the first half is a superb Proposal and the second half is fairly traditional Hollywood pablum. In the first half, the wonderful comedic timing and chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds was terrific. The writing was first-rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put-downs. Kudos to the Director, Anne Fletcher, and the Screenwriter, Pete Chiarelli.The completely different tone in the second half, I surmise, could only be attributed to the studios/producers stepping in and stating that the film must appeal to a wider audience. We, then, get lots of family characters thrown in, with a great reduction of Bullock and Reynolds mutual screen time. And when they do share time in the second half, it's more about slapstick/physical humor (cue studios/producers needing appeal to wider, a.k.a, younger audience). Maudlin music comes in on the soundtrack, letting us know that this part of the movie is supposed to tug on our heartstrings.I don't buy the inevitable resolution either. I don't believe that it is supported well or justified by what came before it.The 1st 45 minutes is WELL worth seeing. I wish the filmmakers could have pushed and maintained the pace and feel for the entire movie. Reynolds and Bullock are so good, they could be this generation's Tracy and Hepburn. I'd like to see them in another project that follows through all the way.BTW, this film was actually shot in Boston and (the Alaska scenes) in Manchester by the Sea and Rockport on the North Shore with digital effects adding snow capped mountains. You might even recognize Motif No.1, a famous small building on a wharf in Rockport which has been the subject of many famous painters' and photographers' work. It was also fun seeing some of my local Boston area acting colleagues doing background work in the film."
tt1041829,6.0,"Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel's ""The Devil Wears Prada"", I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock's break-out vehicle, 1995's ""While You Were Sleeping"", including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ingénue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock's die-hard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher (""27 Dresses"") and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.The storyline has Bullock playing vituperative book editor Margaret Tate, a workaholic careerist who instills fear into her entire office. As her bullied assistant Andrew Paxton, Reynolds caters to her every whim in the hopes that she will help boost his publishing career. As is typical for an opposites-attract rom-com, a complication occurs when Margaret, a Canadian, finds out she is to be deported because her visa application has been denied. Instead of facing immediate termination, she manipulates Andrew to let her superiors know that they are getting married. This moment of desperate deceit leads to an awkward visit with an immigration agent who senses a green-card arrangement and requires proof of their relationship. In order to avert suspicion, Margaret accompanies Andrew to visit his close-knit family in Sitka, Alaska, where it is revealed his family is quite wealthy and in fact, run many of the businesses in town.They continue their charade of being engaged, which of course, fans the flames of his family's enthusiasm for a wedding. The rest of the film is pretty much you would expect save a strange episode of Andrew's grandmother performing a native dance in the woods. It's funny to see how Bullock cleverly uses the same prickliness she displayed effectively in her near-cameo in Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" in this film's establishing scenes as Margaret. In turn, Reynolds shows smart timing as put-upon Andrew, and their interplay has a nice edge. Note how well they perform during the best scenes early on when Margaret baldly lies about their upcoming nuptials at the office and in front of the immigration officer. It's just when they move into more traditional rom-com territory where their chemistry feels weakened and the sparks doused. Chiarelli's haphazard screenplay doesn't help them as they have little beyond one bedtime confessional scene to make us think they may belong together. Craig T. Nelson plays a familiar role as Andrew's disapproving father, but their subplot weighs down the proceedings unnecessarily.Except for one brief face-off with Nelson, Mary Steenburgen is wasted as Andrew's always-smiling mother. Betty White is a welcome sight as feisty Grandma Annie, although I wish the creators could have made her more like Sue Ann Nivens (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"") and less like Rose Nylund (""The Golden Girls""). As the girl Andrew left behind in Sitka, Malin Akerman (""Watchmen"") is actually left stranded by the script, while Oscar Nuñez (""The Office"") grows increasingly tiresome as store clerk/male stripper Ramone. His absurd club performance, along with a nude run-in between the principals, just shows how little faith the creators had in the material to sustain the plot. Standard extras come with the 2009 DVD: a decent commentary track from Fletcher and Chiarelli (but sadly not the actors), seven minutes of outtakes, two deleted scenes of little interest, and an alternate ending which really just switches the locale versus the resolution."
tt1041829,5.0,"The moment when pushy boss Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) suddenly forces her unsuspecting, docile, but ever-so-hunky young assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to tell her superiors they're to be married so she won't be deported back to her native Canada, there's a certain awkward amusement. But it's more in the way Ryan Reynolds plays it than the situation, as written -- our unease, and the actor's. If there is such a thing as ""reality,"" this ain't it. What's a Ken-doll type like Ryan Reynolds doing in a job like this? The answer is, waiting for this moment. Otherwise, if you had the sort of guy who might really be doing this sort of job, you wouldn't have a romantic comedy, and that's what the makers of the elaborately lame The Proposal are reaching for.It's not just that the assistant would probably be gay, or a young woman, as are Meryl Streep's in The Devil Wears Prada. Well, yes, it is, in a way. The author of the Prada book had worked for Anna Wintour. This ill-conceived book editor is feared by everyone on the floor just like the editor of Vogue. But although she seems ready to fire anyone she doesn't like, she does nothing but read unsolicited manuscripts while riding an exercise bike and coax well-known authors into doing Oprah. Her assistant, who presumably takes care of everything else, is an aspiring writer and editor, but he still looks like a guy who spends most of his time at the gym.The standard Forties material -- sparring guy-and-gal fall in love -- has to stand the test of 21st-century role-reversals, boss-lady, servile man. But the real problem is the serious lack of chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds. This is role for Katharine Hepburn, who could be imperious, overbearing, elegant, but very feminine. If only Ryan Reynolds were Cary Grant, but needless to say, he isn't. He's not suave, merely fresh and pleasant. The best you can say for him is that despite his bulky muscles he looks okay in a suit. The wardrobe department are the unsung heroes of this film. But it's not that Reynolds or Bullock does bad work, just that the writing sucks.The movie doesn't manage to establish Margaret's dominance or Andrew's competence before the plot gets its sendoff. Instead, off they go to Alaska to meet his family on a weekend when the Paxtons plan to celebrate the ninetieth birthday of Andrew's Grandma Annie (Betty White). Clearly, Andrew realizes he now has the upper hand. Margaret threatens to fire him if he doesn't cooperate, but she has more to lose. And so he sets out to make her experience in Alaska hell.But the new venue takes over and the comedy gets lost in the surprises Andrew's family offers. The Paxtons turn out to be by far the richest people in the remote town of Sitka (no, not Sitcom). This is the lazy way to handle the situation, so long as the filmmakers have the budget for it, which they do: poshness is so generic, so Hollywood. On hand are Craig T. Nelson from The Family Stone and Mary Mary Steenburgen from a couple more raucous but equally bad family comedies, 'Step Brothers' and 'Four Christmases.' And veteran Betty White, whose energy at 87 is admirable, but whose eccentric old lady role is annoying and cloying.Anne Fletcher lacks inventiveness and finesse in staging the standard situations. When Andrew has to jump into bed with Margaret in the morning when mom brings in breakfast (the Paxtons are rich, but they still do all the work in their mansion, except at party time), the sequence is drawn-out and unfunny. When the still-unfriendly couple accidentally fall on top of each other while naked, it's more clunky than cute: they're like big icky wet statues. It's better not even to talk about the omnipresent Ramone, played by Oscar Nuñez of ""The Office,"" who apparently somebody thinks is funny enough to be a waiter, a general store manager, an erotic dancer, and the minister for a wedding ceremony. The erotic dancer part is excruciating. Only in Sitka, not, hopefully, in any other movie. Did the filmmakers bring in an actor from ""The Office"" to make up for how poorly they developed the office scenes earlier in the movie? Oh yes, and there's other fun stuff like an eagle chasing a puppy and then flying off with Margaret's cell phone instead; Betty White chanting around a fire with a rug; Betty Steenbergen looking harried; and Craig T. Nelson driving biodegradable golf balls into the bay. When the two would-be lovebirds return to New York and tell the immigration officer they're in love for real now and willing to undergo his scrutiny, he says ""Let's do it!"" Let's not."
tt1041829,6.0,"The Proposal is a hard film not to enjoy but it's an even harder film to admire. Aside from the two exceptional lead performances from Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock and the humour they create, the story is dowsed in clichés and left to drown. I need a film to at least be thoroughly realistic if not authentic, and the tired screenplay often delves into slapstick and camp when it should have let the leads carry the film.Bullock and Reynolds ooze charisma in all scenarios here, and their chemistry is what anchors the film firmly in watchability, even elevating the film at times to outright excellence. And to The Proposal's credit for every cliché it puts forth, we often get a quick rebuttal of charm, but which ultimately asks the question, why in the first place? I am almost tempted to follow in critic gene Siskel's footsteps and swear off watching movie trailers, because all the best line are in the promotional material; I don't mean they are the only good lines, simply that they would have made the film even more enjoyable had they been fresh. Directed by Anne Fletcher, who has already had rom-com success with Step Up and 27 Dresses, takes a chance with Bullock in my opinion as most would have good with a younger, hot-at-the-moment star. She does not disappoint and in her role as boss, Bullock is certainly suited; imagine that, a character that looks their supposed age.The plot is certainly one of contrivance, as are with most romantic comedies today, with the stern manger of a publishing firm (Bullock) essentially blackmailing her younger assistant Andrew (Reynolds) into marrying her so she can save herself from deportation and stay in the U.S. It just so happens of course, that it is Andrew's grandmother's birthday that very weekend and is heading up to Alaska for the celebration. Trapped in secluded north, will this faux engagement become something real? The worst scenes of the film take place in the office, with the underlings of the tyrannical boss quite literally diving for cover upon her arrival. We have surely seen in films like Office Space and The Devil Wears Prada that a work scenario can combine humour with realism without the need for the employees to act like Looney Toones characters. My first impression of the time frame in which evil over bearer and ambitious assistant fall in love was that of annoyance as such feelings would never form so quickly. However I may have initially judged too harshly, as is nicely illustrated, Andrew and Margaret only have each other. Andrew is ambitious and loyal, knowing everything about Margaret, and in turn Margaret is so dedicated to her job without any semblance of a personal life, he is her only true confidante and slowly the scenario becomes slightly less preposterous.The Alaskan scenery is beautiful, and the supporting cast including the delightful Betty White, Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson make for a well rounded and talented cast. My absolute favourite member, which perhaps not coincidently my favourite part of the film, is Malin Akerman as an old flame of Andrew's. It was so refreshing to see an ex portrayed as a nice, honest human being instead of a vengeful witch and it is these intermittent moments of true human emotion that wouldn't make me turn this film off if I happened by it again; even if I wouldn't seek it out on my own accord.Read all my reviews at www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
tt1041829,5.0,"Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a mean boss. Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) is her long suffering assistant. When she is about to be deported for her immigration problems, she forces her assistant to marry her. An INS agent is going to test them, so they must spend time together for her to learn about him. Only he has to fly home to Alaska for his grandma Annie (Betty White)'s 90th birthday.Sandra Bullock's character is way too unlikeable and she's miscast. They need an actress who plays meanies. Then she can melt and become a good person and blah blah blah... There's no doubt that Bullock and Reynolds are great comedic actors. They just need a better story. Betty White had some fun. And having Bullock and Reynolds naked was quite funny."
tt1041829,5.0,"The formula of a great romantic comedy certainly exists in The Proposal. You've got big-name attractive stars, who have been successful in rom-coms before. You've got a plot that is reminiscent of other films, where two people who don't get along must pretend to be in a relationship. Why is it that the creative team simply couldn't make all those elements work to form a solid movie? My first guess is that they started with a sub-par script. The comedy never quite works, and I didn't even find myself chuckling at the situations. There are a few moments when Ryan Reynolds will deliver a line that feels like a throwaway joke, and those made me laugh more than anything else in the movie. Even the amazing Betty White didn't get any good jokes, unless you find her dancing around in a Native American headdress to be funny.I think one of the other things that hurts the Proposal is the fact that it doesn't feel like the right casting. In my opinion, Sandra Bullock has more of a girl-next-door quality, so she doesn't work so well as this hard-nosed workaholic who mistreats all of her employees. We're supposed to see her as the equivalent to Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada, and I just don't buy it. This also means that her transformation throughout the film doesn't have a natural flow because she's quick to settle into her comfort zone, and that means the devil-woman disappears too fast. All the flaws don't change the fact that I still enjoy some of the rom-com tropes that are included in The Proposal. It has those moments of conflict and reconciliation that warm your heart and sell you on the relationship. It's not going to be added to my list of favorites of the genre, that I gladly rewatch on a regular basis, but it's certainly not the worst."
tt15257160,6.0,"Pain Hustlers is an opioid rendition of the Wolf of Wall Street by the way of The Big Short which means it's a really entertaining true story with a clear purpose but it's also really hard to deny that it took the safest and most boring approach to telling such an important story, drowning out the more serious aspects in favour of something more generic.Emily Blunt is great, the film wants you to genuinely care about her despite the flaws and it's her skill that actually makes that happen. Chris Evans continues to get as far away from Captain America as humanly possible with another undemanding yet enjoyable irredeemable asshole.It's so nice to see director David Yates finally break free of the Harry Potter franchise with something so different, even if the newfound style here is derivative and remains fairly desaturated. The needle drops are used the right amount, they work well even if some of them are incredibly obvious song choices."
tt15257160,5.0,"Liza (Emily Blunt) is broke, depressed and looking after a sick child. One day she runs into pharmaceutical company exec (Chris Evans) and takes the plunge as a sales rep selling a cancer pain relief drug to doctors. Soon she is raking in it and becomes rich and influential, but is troubled by the strategy of Evans and more particularly their boss Dr Neel (Andy Garcia) in their sales techniques.Whilst Blunt is impressive and largely holds the film together, the overall effect is remarkably cold and flat and seems to take ages to get through its 2 hour running time. Chris Evans seems to sit at the back appearing occasionally, coming out to scream and shout a lot, whilst Garcia is actually quite good fun as the increasingly crazed, doesn't give a dam boss. Overall this could have been a sharp vicious satire on the value of money over everything else in America's prescription drug market, but instead it's a rather wasted opportunity and a somewhat uninvolving drama."
tt15257160,6.0,"In style & content, inspired-by-truth pharma-scandal drama ""Pain Hustlers"" feels like it's been made many times before. Struggling single-mum Emily Blunt (daughter of Catherine O'Hara) takes a low-level sales job in Chris Evans, Andy Garcia, Amit Shah & Jay Duplass' small pain-drug company, which she saves from closure, then turns into a massive overnight success via dubious, immoral & ultimately illegal methods of 'recruiting' doctors to write scripts & bump up prescriptions. It's polished (by fine blockbuster director David Yates) but the Wells Tower screenplay and Blunt & Evans performances are tired. Big Pharma sucks - ok Hollywood, we got the memo, enough."
tt15257160,5.0,"Emily Blunt is good in everything (and *great* in some of them), but she's said in the past that she tries to avoid mimicking an American accent, as she does here. And I can see (hear) why: Kate Winslet is mistress extraordinaire of American accents, whereas Emily struggles from scene to scene to sound like she's from the same, distinct place. Because a lot of British actors have heard and studied Southern drawls (think Vivien Leigh) they tend to lapse into one whether meaning to or not. Anyway, Emily gives a good, believable performance as the lead in this big Pharma tale, but Chris Evans struggles against his ingrained ""nice guy"" image, Catherine O'Hara goes over the top as the mother of Emily's character, and Andy Garcia-I don't even know what to say. In the last year or so, there have been several mini-series about the infamous case of OxyContin & Purdue Pharma, and they were better than this film about a lesser-known Fentanyl nasal spray. Check those out instead of this one, unless like me, you must see EVERYthing Emily Blunt's in!"
tt7657566,6.0,"I love Agatha Christie novels and want so badly to enjoy big screen interpretations of her stories. I think her writing is what makes Death on the Nile work better than it would otherwise. It's a solid mystery that has plenty of good twists and turns because there are multiple layers of mystery beyond just the murders. Thankfully, it has been long enough since I read the book so I didn't totally remember the actual solution to the whodunit. However, I figured things out relatively early because Branagh struggles to deliver these type of mysteries with any subtlety, and that's a shame. You'd think it would be obvious that you don't want someone almost literally shouting ""Pay attention, this is a clue!"" but that's what we have here. Also, while I said I guessed the truth early, I just mean early in relation to when the first murder occurred. Because it takes almost half the runtime for things to truly get going.Some of the character work in Death on the Nile was solid, and I appreciated seeing a couple people play against type. They take a lot of time to establish the relationships between all these characters which I would ordinarily appreciate. It's too bad Branagh (or the studio) thought we were too dumb to follow all the groundwork they were laying out, so they literally had a character painstakingly explain to Poirot everything all over again. He might as well have broken the fourth wall and just spoken straight to the audience since it's so clearly all for our benefit. The ending was also corny and handled poorly, plus some of the green-screen of Nile scenery in the background was horribly shoddy. All that being said, I still appreciated aspects of Death on the Nile. It's a genre I love, written by an author I love, and starring a detective I love. Considering all that, it's no wonder I managed to have a good time with a film that really isn't put together all that well."
tt7657566,5.0,"First off, great cast and amazing acting, the leads had chemistry and the emotions felt authentic. However, the score and cinematography were mediocre borderline poor. It was painfully obvious that every set was green screen. The score left too many dead moments. Also, what was with that very weird Gadot as Cleopatra moment?!"
tt7657566,6.0,"The book is simple. The book is not a long book just short of a 300 pages, so why the unnecessary changes to the characters from the book? It either broke interesting characters or completely removed them. Some characters from the book are combined in a single character in the movie and not for the best. WHY??? These changes completely ruined the smooth structure of the book to ""simplify"" it for modern audiences I suppose but again, WHY? The book is not that difficult to follow. Another thing that ruined the movie is the horrendous CGI. The CGI looks like a cutscene from a Playstation 3 game. The green screen OMG looks like someone cutout the character from a green screen with his phone and then pasted on a badly drawn background. And lastly the acting. I'm sorry but most of the cast were bad, which is sad because most of them proved their talent in other projects (except Gal Gadot. All she has is a beautiful smile)
Skip this movie. If you want a good detective story go read the book. It's not a long story. You'll probably finish the book a day. 3-4 days if english is not your first language. Yes it's that easy to read through and understand it."
tt7657566,6.0,"I don't always agree with the professional critics, but I have to say that I do agree this adaption, is, without a doubt, the most turgid and poorly executed Christie adaption that there has been.There is over an hour of the film before the mystery even begins and that interminable hour consists of exposition that leave the characters as two dimensional as when it started. And half of the characters seem shoveled in with no purpose whatsoever. E.g. Sophie Okonedo. She is a great actress. Perhaps the best in this cast. I strongly recommend people see her Hollow Crown and Hotel Rwanda. But her character (or that of the character's niece) in Death on the Nile is what? Serves what plot purpose? (Answer: none)The actual ""solving"" of the mystery has to be the most predictable Christie adaption ever. It is a outright ""Cui bono?"" It makes it clear this is written for very low brow audience."
tt7657566,6.0,"Death on the Nile fails to meet the high standard of its predecessor Murder on the Orient Express. That being said the film is beautifully shot and the final act is an overall fun mystery ride. The film is generally well acted and directed. One negative is that the audience is just told things a little too much. Murder on the Orient Express had a little more set up and the audience felt more of a part of the mystery early on. That aspect of storytelling felt diminished in this sequel. The mystery does not really pick up until the final act and even then some things are just explained by Detective Poirot without any of the tantalizing intrigue that the first film possessed. Murder on the Orient Express had an amazing twist with good people doing a bad thing which made the audience seriously reflect on the right and wrong of the crime. Unfortunately, Death on the Nile's big twist of bad people doing a bad thing for money felt a little flat. Murder on the Orient Express was a work of art. Death on the Nile is a decent mystery movie."
tt7657566,6.0,"I hope a genius like Kenneth Branagh can find another outlet for his directorial style and leave Dame Christie alone. I guess he fancies himself Poirot and wants that role. Like with Orient Express, he is not all that interesting. If anything, he gets a little too flamboyant at times. The story is great in the book. Here it plods along, taking nearly the first half for anything to happen. It's more than exposition. In one scene there is a menu of characters presented to the viewer. Show them. Don't tell them. I have to say I was disappointed because I was told by a friend that this was really an excellent movie. Live and learn."
tt7657566,6.0,"I beg Mr. Branagh to direct and/or produce films based on Agatha Christie's novels but NOT TO PERFORM as Hercule Poirot, anymore. Please...Not even his moustache is credible.After having watched Peter Ustinov's and David Suchet's WONDERFUL Poirots...there is no way I can like this current Hercule.Neither in this movie nor in the previous one.Besides,as a Christie's fan, I watched the 1978 version of her novel and that was a beautiful piece of art. Actually located in Egypt and full of great famous actors (who were absolutely absent at this time).This is my humble advice to Kenneth ...knowing he won't read it,of course.I hope the other people here (at IMDB) will join my wish.Regards from Argentina.♥"
tt7657566,6.0,"I wasn't anxious to see Kenneth Branagh's version of DEATH ON THE NILE. I thought his remake of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS was a poor imitation of Sidney Lumet's masterpiece, and his mustache awful. Previews of this movie made it apparent that he had changed mustaches, by gluing one on top of another; this made him look like Eddie Izzard. When the movie started with the Belgians going over the top against the Germans during an anachronistic gas attack in World War One, I felt even worse. Did Branagh think that stretching out the movie with Poirot's back story would make something out of a collection of tics that Agatha Christie used in place of learning how to write a character? Was this supposed to add depth to the stereotypes and make of this more than another of her perfectly plotted impossible murder mysteries? Was I going to care about any of these waxwork figures?And by the end I did. Whether this is simply a matter of having my expectations set so very low, or Branagh's understanding of Shakespearean drama and how to supervise a flawless Nilotic location shoot, I cannot tell. Some star casting was wasted, although it's nice to see French & Saunders back together again. Gal Gadot's native Sabra accent comes and goes; Letitia Wright gets to score some points, and by the end we regret every murder, victims of their own weaknesses. And despite the awkward ending, Poirot comes off as someone more than a collection of little grey cells who wants to retire and raise vegetable marrows."
tt7657566,6.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. For us Agatha Christie fans, a certain amount of trepidation exists every time a new movie or TV version of her work hits. Stress level was reduced a bit this time since director-actor Kenneth Branagh and screenwriter Michael Green are back following their collaboration on Christie's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (2017). Although the star power this time isn't quite at the level of 'Orient', it seems Mr. Branagh has grown quite fond and confident of his own Hercule Poirot, the Belgian super-sleuth.Director Branagh takes an unusual approach with a black and white Prologue from 1914 as a young Poirot shows flashes of his intellect as a soldier in WWI. The real purpose of this segment is to show Poirot was once a young man in love, and then a wounded soldier in love, and then a broken-hearted wounded man who would go on to become the world's greatest detective. The prologue also provides backstory on the infamous mustache that is so much a part of Poirot.We then flash forward to a 1937 London speakeasy where a fastidious Poirot fusses over dessert while watching the formation of a shaky love triangle unfold on the dance floor as Salome Otterbourne (Sophie Okonedo, with singing vocals from Sister Rosetta Tharpe) belts out her bluesy tunes on stage. Initially it's Jacqueline de Bellefort (relative newcomer Emma Mackey) in the throes of lustful dance moves with her fiancé Simon Doyle (Armie Hammer in the last gasp of a once skyrocketing career). Things change quickly when Jacqui's former schoolmate, Linnete Ridgeway (Gal Gadot), makes her show-stopping appearance in a glittery metallic gown. Flash forward again, this time 6 weeks, and its Linnete and Simon tying the knot at the picturesque Cataract Hotel in Aswan on the River Nile. See, Linnete is an heiress to her less-than-scrupulous father's fortune, and Simon had no trouble trading up. Jacqui, on the other hand, doesn't take it so well.Of course the fun part of Agatha Christie's murder mysteries involves getting to know the players and watching as the clues reveal themselves, and then how Poirot handles the big reveal. This film's only real weakness is the character development of everyone not named Hercule Poirot. We only skim the surface of Euphemia Buoc (Annette Bening) as Buoc's (a returning Tom Bateman) disapproving mother, Dr. Windlesham (an unusually reserved Russell Brand), Linnete's chambermaid Louise (Rose Leslie), Linette's Godmother and her ""nurse"" (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French, respectively), family attorney Andrew (Ali Fazal), and Salome's niece and manager, Rosalie (Letitia Wright), the proverbial sharpest knife in the drawer.So what do we get? Well, first and foremost, a fully formed Poirot. Branagh seems to have embraced the character and the mustache, having a blast with his scenes. We also get stunning work from cinematographer Harris Zambarloukos, as he films the beautiful people, the beautiful wardrobes, and such sites as the Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, Ramses statues of Abu Simbel, and the excellent set piece known as the Karnak luxury steamer. There are some metaphorical effects inserted that periodically startle us, and seem unnecessary, but then over-the-top moments are not unusual in film presentations of Christie's writing. She passed away in 1976, and now there are almost 200 film and TV projects associated with her work.Love and betrayal are key elements here, and for fans of the original book and the 1978 film version, comparisons are unavoidable. Ms. Mackey's jilted lover stalker is a marked improvement over Mia Farrow's character, while Salome and Rosalie and terrific additions. Ms. Saunders and Ms. French follow in the footsteps of cinematic heavyweights Bette Davis and Maggie Smith, and your choice of Branagh or Peter Ustinov as Poirot is one left up to you. It's tough to beat 'whodunnit escapism', though it's a personal choice on which of Christie's stories serve up the best puzzle pieces on the big screen.Opens in theaters on February 11, 2022."
tt7657566,6.0,"I really rather enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express, and so was looking forward to this follow up, however was left altogether disappointed.After a wholly unnecessary first 10 minutes, we finally get going with the movie proper, which is torturously slow for its first hour. There is far too long to wait until we actually get a death on the Nile. I'm all for a slow build up and scene setting, but it just felt very pedestrian and strained in this film.The final act leading up to the reveal is rather more exciting, but unfortunately the reveal itself is rather predictable and not overly complex or satisfying, meaning the film ends on a bit of an underwhelming note.The ensemble cast is hit and miss, with so many dodgy accents and ultimately a rather bland collection of characters.What this film does have going for it is a pretty well executed tone. It strikes plenty of the right notes in creating a satisfying murder mystery vibe at its core, its just a shame that this couldn't be built on.Disappointing, but just about fun enough when it does get going to make a watch somewhat worthwhile."
tt7657566,6.0,"Well, I can't really claim that the 2022 movie ""Death on the Nile"" is one that I was particularly excited to watch. Why? Well, it is a remake and haven't the Agatha Christie 1937 murder mystery been put to the screen enough times already? I mean, 1978 and again in 2004, wasn't that enough?But still, I got the opportunity to sit down and watch this 2022 version from director Kenneth Branagh, so I opted to watch what he had to offer.And I will say that ""Death on the Nile"" definitely is a stylish feature. There are so much attention to detail in the sets, props, costumes and such, and that spruced up the movie quite a lot, especially if you have an eye for detail.With that being said, then I will admit that ""Death on the Nile"" certainly was watchable. It wasn't a great movie, mind you, but it was watchable and enjoyable enough for what it turned out to be. The movie isn't, however, a movie that you will watch more than once, as it usually goes for murder mysteries.Something that ""Death on the Nile"" had working for it was the rather amazing cast ensemble. I was rather impressed with the sheer amount of talented performers that were on the cast list. So at least you get to watch this movie brought to the screen by people whom have their art down to near perfection.Of course there is an audience out there for murder mysteries, be it in book form, TV series form, or even movie form, so yeah ""Death on the Nile"" is definitely going to have a fan base out there. Maybe even among those that enjoyed the previous movie versions as well.My rating of ""Death on the Nile"" lands on a six out of ten stars. It was watchable and fairly enjoyable, I will say that much. But I know that I will never return to watch ""Death on the Nile"" a second time."
tt7657566,6.0,"Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) suffers facial injuries during The Great War which leads him to spot a massive moustache. It's 1937. Poirot is invited on an Egyptian vacation and a cruise on the Nile. It's a trip full of intrigue, romantic disputes, and... murder.The black-and-white war opening gave me hope that Branagh is attempting to update and give the old Agatha Christie story, a dark interesting tone and a healthy dose of grim reality. At last, Branagh does pull back to more standard Christie with some changes. There is a veneer of artificiality with the obvious CGI and Branagh's cinematic style. It remains a compelling and fun murder mystery. It does have some good actors... and a problematic one. All in all, this struggles to inject something new in this old material but it's still a good watch."
tt7657566,6.0,"I don't really like the first ""Murder On The Orient Express"" so I watch this with little expectations. And as expected, this movie is a let down.The acting is average. CGI is mediocre. And the story is weak. When the murder happens I can already tell who's the killer, and how the murderer did it.I don't understand why they add the war scene. Just to tell audience why Poirot grow magnificent moustache? That totally unnecessary.I've read a lot of Poirot novel, this is a different way to depict him. And in a bad way."
tt3567288,6.0,"The big question on people's mind seems to be, is The Visit a return to form for the once promising director, M. Night Shyamalan. The answer is yes and no. While the film is leaps and bounds better than his last 4 previous efforts which include: the dreadful After Earth, the boring Last Airbender, the inane The Happening and the disappointing Lady in the Water, it fails to be anything more than another entry in a long list of horror found footage films. Yes, M. Night Shyamalan has fallen far my friends, so much that just his name on the screen invokes laughter and groans from the audience. He has to fall back and rely on an overused horror genre to bring some sort of credit to his tarnished legacy.His entry into the found footage genre is The Visit. What Jaws did for the water, The Visit might do for old people. When a mother of two young kids is contacted by her estranged parents, asking to finally see their grandkids, she decides to let her kids go live with their grandparents for the week, while she goes away on vacation. The kids are so excited that the film loving daughter decides to make a documentary about it. Bringing her trusted camera along for the ride, she captures some odd footage from her grandparents and weirder and weirder things start happening after 9:30. So we have to ask ourselves, what's wrong with NaNa and Pop Pop???The one thing this film does right is something that Shyamalan seems to do well or at least use to, is create a terrific atmosphere. The old home has just enough corners here and there to raise the tension, to make us as ourselves, ""What's behind the corner over there?"" Having the film be a found footage picture, gives Shyamalan more control over the camera. He can choose what to reveal and when is trickier ways which put the characters in a bit more danger. One terrific sequence where Shyamalan is really at his best is when the kids decide to play Hide and Seek under the house. You expect the unexpected and Shyamalan delivers probably the best scene he's done in years.The grandparents are excellent; they convey just the right amount of oddness and sympathy. Each scene that they have alone with the kids is when they try to explain away the weirdness of the other. NaNa describes why Pop Pop does the things he does and vice versa. It was an interesting dynamic between the characters that immediately tells you that they are hiding something. Unfortunately, the same can't really be said about the children. Two unbelievable kids, which means I did not believe anything they did was genuine. Whether it is rapping, yes the kid raps a lot, or the cinematic dialogue the girl uses. Nothing they said or did ring true to me, which took me out of the experience.The Visit is creepy enough to warrant a watch for those that love the found footage films. It's shot in a way that doesn't lead to vertigo or nausea. You finally have a film where you get to see everything that happens on the screen, which was a nice change of pace. Shyamalan might not be back in the good graces of people, but The Visit is a decent start."
tt3567288,6.0,"While, the movie isn't really that funny, or scary. This horror movie written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan was surprising, not that bad. It had the right amount of horror and comedy to make it, somewhat entertaining. The Visit proves once again, that this where Shyamalan belongs. After all, these are the genres that M. Night Shyamalan is known best for. It also helps that the movie was marketed as a small-budget independent film, rather than a huge money blockbuster. This allows, Shyamalan to work harder on the story asset, rather than focusing his time, on over-the-top visual effects. Unlike Shyamalan's recent films, there is an emotional depth to The Visit that is worth seeing, alone. The movie tells the story of contemporary grief/loss and how not to hold on to anger to your loves ones, because you don't know if you'll ever get a chance to forgive/reconcile with them. It's a very strong message that anybody can related to. I really did get invested in the story of a family is trying to recovered, from a recent divorce. Hoping to give their mother, Paula Jamison (Kathryn Hahn) a well-needed vacation with her new boyfriend; two young kids, Thirteen-year-old Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and 15-year-old Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) agree to spend a week with their grandparents, even though, they never met them. At first, their ""Nana"" (Deanna Dunagan) and ""Pop Pop"" (Peter McRobbie), seem fine, but things started to unravel, when night falls. Can the kids survive their week with them, or will something deadly happen? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie is clearly not a 'found-footage' movie, like some critics label it. It doesn't have, that raw factor that many found-footage movie, has. First off, the camera visual style isn't that amateurism. There wasn't a lot of blurry shots, shaking cam, or pitch darkness shots. Thank God! I like that the movie was mostly well-shot. Shyamalan uses the style with more creativity than most other filmmakers, displaying his unique visual motif. Some great examples are his use of reflected images for dramatic and thematic effect. Others are his use of intimacy long-takes and how he creates a Mise en scène. Plus, the movie, zig-zagged, heavily, from traditionally In-Universe storytelling camera shots to hand-held. It's felt more Cinéma vérité, with bits of documentary style. It's really hard to bypass this as 'realistic found-footage' movie, when there are credits & day title cards, being shown, throughout the film. It's a bit jarring to see that. However, I get, why it's filmed on a hand-held camera. There is in universe reason for this. It was film, this way, because Rebecca is an aspiring, documentary filmmaker with a big heart. Rebecca wants to document the whole thing as a form of therapy for her mum, whose reasons for the bad blood with her parents remain a tightly-kept secret. The characters themselves are even aware of certain cinematic theories that could make their ""documentary"" more interesting. They're refreshingly intelligent and self-aware, and they never blunder stupidly into any situation. I also love the straight-to-camera confessions scenes. You really get to see, their desires and anxieties through it. Using this, Shyamalan was able to show, a large range of emotional, within his actors. In my opinion, most of the actors give great performances. The child actors were very likable. The grandparent are downright creepy. However, there were a few things that didn't work for me. I really didn't like how the film establish the kid's phobias. It wasn't use, right. I really don't get, how Becca is afraid of looking at herself on camera, but she's okay, at looking at herself, on Skype. Another thing, why Tyler is afraid of germs, yet, he's willing to play hide and seek, under the dirty stairs. It doesn't make sense. For the grandparents. I really didn't like Grandma's over the top, ""alien"" theory. Remind me, too much of his previous awful films, 2006's Lady and the Water, and 2002's Signs. Her jump scares and suicide attempts were also pretty lame. It seem, more silly than disturbing. I also didn't like, the poop or cleaning the gun jokes for the Grandpa. It really seem way too cartoony and fell really flat. Nevertheless, I still like their Yahtzee scene. By far, the best part of the film. Some of the grandfather's dialogue, is kinda choppy, and unrealistic in tone, too. The film has also been criticized for its use of dementia equals violent, approach, by other critics; but in my opinion, I just glad, it wasn't cause, by, anything supernatural. Overall: I came into this movie with very low expectations. After all, it's been a while, since director M. Night Shyamalan made an alright movie. While, this movie isn't bad, it wasn't really good. It was pretty mediocre. As much as people might hate him, in my opinion, Shyamalan is a filmmaker whom somewhat deserve a comeback. Hopefully, his next movie will be a masterpiece. Sadly, this movie wasn't it"
tt3567288,5.0,"Disappointment! The Visit breaks down into two concepts: what worked and what did not. What did not work: Another Blair Witch documentary style horror film! Shaky camera amateurish look with over long narration just like all the fake documentary genre horror films. The Visit comes across as self-absorbed and amateurish which annoys the viewer, and gets old fast. A granddaughter wants to meet her estranged grandparents which creates a stretched out boring personal narration, which adds little to the story line. The estranged grandparents exhibit clinical behaviors of paranoid schizophrenia and dementia, which becomes hard to watch. What worked: The plot twist where the mom lets the kids know via skype ""that's not my parents"". The end is tension filled of how will the children escape. The protagonist finds out the grandparents were murdered, and that the grandparents volunteered at the institute was not a great idea. Strong conclusions for a painful to watch story. Shyamalan (writer/director) has great concepts, plot twists, but regrettably Shyamalan's movies become bogged down in deep details which do not translate from word to film well. 5 out of 10."
tt3567288,6.0,"Shyamalan has suffered like few other directors as a result of his later films not measuring up to the exacting standards set by The Sixth Sense and Signs. Part of this is self-inflicted, because he has refused to veer from the""M. Night Shyamalan"" formula: modern fairy tale crafted to take an unexpected turn approximately two-thirds into the fun. When the twist fails to impress or the fairy tale is dull, the movie disappoints audiences on on two levels. Not only is the movie judged mediocre, but it is criticized for failing to deliver on the promise made by Shyamalan's earlier efforts.The fairy tale and twist delivered by The Visit do not disappoint. Hansel and Gretel effectively employ today's media and technology for narration and exposition, leading the viewer down an increasingly foreboding path. The fear and anxiety caused by Nana and Pop-Pop's odd behavior appeal to our politically incorrect subconscious: we shy away and are even repulsed by displays of dementia and senility, no matter how clinically explicable we understand those displays to be. I was pleasantly surprised that the predicted twist was not predictable, and I felt a sincere surge of a-ha! at its revelation.The Visit falls short with respect to the traditional elements of film-making. The children, particularly the brother, are portrayed as cloying, non-credible 1980s sitcom characters with cheesy lines. Attempts at humor come off like a toast at a Dirty Dancing era summer camp in the Catskills. The siblings show no sign of being actual teenagers from the 21st century until approximately 45 minutes into the film, when they interview each other for their ""documentary"" and reveal certain vulnerabilities. The forced nature of this scene serves to highlight the otherwise inauthentic personalities assigned to them by the director and script. The mother's character is painted with the same superficial gloss, a problem magnified by her limited time on screen. These weaknesses prevented me from empathizing with the family members and reminded me throughout that I was indeed watching a movie.Perhaps Shyamalan was so focused on invoking his brand upon The Visit that he was distracted from maintaining its essential quality. Like many other viewers, I still look forward to the film where he regains that balance."
tt3567288,6.0,"It started out good, but the movie wasn't scary and the twist doesn't add up. For example: If they aren't the grandparents, wouldn't they see a photo of them from their mom before visiting? Besides, how did they escape the asylum and what does that have to do with not leaving the room at 9:30?"
tt3567288,5.0,"The thing I found out (to my dismay) that I did not know before going to the theater was that a lot of this movie was shot in the long over-used and abused ""home movie/shaky cam"" format. If I had come in the theater in the middle of the movie, I might have assumed I had accidentally wandered into the 7th, or whatever, sequel to Paranormal Activity. And to add insult to injury M Night is about 8 years late to the party for that trick. Or was it suppose to be some type of irony or mocking of the standard horror movie fare? Perhaps this once creative director has finally succumbed to audience expectations --if all you want is cookie cutter, unimaginative, thematically barren, shaky cam, scary movies then here you go...... Another let down for me was that in his earlier movies there were always a number of positive sub-themes running through the movies that I found as interesting, if not more so, than the obvious scary movie theme. I failed to find any such redeeming parallel plot lines in The Visit. Again maybe he is just simplifying his movies to match his audience's wishes.On the upside, I did find this movie to be something of an improvement over his most recent efforts. There were a few good chuckles. There were a couple of OK jump scenes. There was some tension here and there, but overall still a disappoint for me. Of course, I eventually liked The Village and Signs a lot better after I had watched them several times on DVD. Maybe there is a jewel in the rough hiding here, just waiting to be found. Rating a 5.5 of 10 on first impression though."
tt3567288,6.0,"Well, OK, it had some sucky components.As usual - * Overblown characters with excessive dwelling on them doing cartoony, cute, 'stuff', as a substitute for actual development. And them doing ridiculous things that nobody would actually do.* Speechy-preachy dialogue.* Long, drawn-out scenes, over and over - except that this time most of them - MOST of them - actually *contribute* to the overall effect rather than just boring the viewer.* Focus on the completely wrong targets: the guy always makes the film he thinks he's making, rather than the one the viewers actually end up seeing, so you end up with these completely non-sequitur, irrelevant 'development' scenes. In this case there is a completely tacked-on pre-ending that leaves the viewer going 'Why is this here? Why are we supposed to care?'-Amazingly, NONE of which destroys it:-The intro is attention-grabbing.The build-up is stately and involving.The Weird piles-on quite disturbingly.And the twist is a GOOD one instead of something DUMB!-This is the first thing I've seen since The 6th Sense that wasn't write-off rubbish.Maybe he's got on, or off, the right medication?? - -- ---"
tt3567288,6.0,"It's the movies that go down the middle that can be the hardest to talk about. When a movie is awesome or just terrible, a lot of stuff springs to mind really quickly. When a movie is kinda mediocre, you struggle to separate the positives from the negatives and it all kinda blends together in a pile. Luckily, even though I gave this movie a 6, there is stuff to talk about and even though this movie didn't completely work for me, it's still a step up for M. Night. But considering his recent output, take that with a grain of salt.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Paula (Kathryn Hahn) is a single mom who has 2 kids, Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould). Rebecca is a teenage aspiring filmmaker and Tyler is a wannabe rapper who Rebecca describes as ""ethnically confused."" Paula works hard and gets very little for herself so the kids want her to spend some time with her new boyfriend Miguel. So she goes on a cruise with Miguel, while her estranged parents John (Peter McRobbie) and Doris (Deanna Dunagan) are going to look after the Rebecca and Tyler for the week. There is some tension with this decision as Paula has had little to no contact with her parents since her teenage years after she moved out with her boyfriend when she was pregnant. But the kids genuinely want their mom to have some time for herself so they board a train and head off to their grandparents.I don't want to go into the plot more to avoid spoiling things, so I think the strength of this movie is that the story/concept is interesting. When you're a kid, being handed over to strangers for an extended period of time is pretty scary, you ease into it of course but initially it can be pretty frightening. This movie plays into those fears well, I can tell you if I had been left with these people, I would not have been so calm and willing to roll with the punches as these kids were. I found it to be intriguing that they found a fairly unique way to tap into a natural fear instead of manufacturing a ghost or a demon from another realm.Another positive is that the acting is largely good. Peter and Deanna are pretty creepy respectively, they really put a lot into their performances, they display some physicality even. Now Olivia and Ed are also solid, their characters themselves are annoying, Ed's rapping is pretty bad and Rebecca doesn't talk like a teenager (her dialogue is obviously written by someone who's older and didn't know how to bring it down to a teenage level) but their performances are good. Kathryn Hahn is also sound in the small amount of screen time she gets. She's an underrated actress and she continues to deliver in the small parts she gets.I'll get into the stuff that didn't work for me. The found footage movie has been done many times over and while I didn't find this one to be especially bad, it certainly didn't add anything new. It didn't have to be found footage and while it being that way was part of the plot, it just felt like a way to keep the movie's budget down as opposed to being an important stylistic choice.As much as I thought the central premise was cool, a lot of the plot relies on coincidence and contrivance. Somehow whenever someone comes to the house, the grandparents are never there. Whenever the grandparents do something crazy, the excuse is they're old (rarely is there a further explanation and when there is, its dropped and barely addressed at all later). Their mom can't see them during their Skype conversations because there's batter on the camera. Paula gives the kids so few details about their grandparents' temperament or their appearance. I understand every movie has that to some degree but it stood out to me here.The film itself wasn't very scary but I did get some laughs (intentional laughs) and toward the end the tension did ramp up. This is another divisive movie, looking at other reviews you either really enjoy it or you hate it with a passion. It's closer to a 6.5/10 for me but since it is technically a horror movie and I wasn't very scared I'll go with a 6/10."
tt3567288,6.0,"As you probably know from M. Night Shyaalan's past movies, they usually include some sort of big twist at the end or near the end. ""The Visit"" is no exception. However, this time around the twist doesn't have a lot of sock to it. It isn't a stupid or misguided twist... it's just very familiar to people like me who have gone through a lot of horror tales (written or filmed) with twists at the end.Actually, that familiar twist wasn't the biggest problem I had with the movie. The big problem I had with the movie is that it is WAY too much stretched out. There is a big amount of unnecessary filler here. If the filler had been removed, we might have had a passable (if somewhat familiar) short subject. But as it is, viewers will probably get eventually impatient with the movie.The movie is well acted and looks very nice for what was a small budget. And there is a mildly creepy feeling generated at times. So there is merit here. But as a whole, the movie doesn't work. Unless you are desperate, I wouldn't recommend you drop by ""The Visit""."
tt10648342,6.0,"Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better."
tt10648342,5.0,"Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies."
tt10648342,5.0,"Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine. It has got to the point where if spending your time aimlessly going through your phone for 2+ hours or watching a marvel movie is a bigger waste of time."
tt10648342,5.0,"This review will come off as very negative, but I had a decent time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, Love and Thunder is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving two goats that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or the 20 times after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is a horrendous decision...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. I can only imagine what could have been if 40% of the movie was dedicated to that character. I can only imagine how amazing it would have been if they treated the God Butcher like The Dark Knight treated Joker.Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me.EDIT: I decided to give this another shot. Sometimes it's easier the second time without the hype and knowing what to expect. But I felt pretty much the same. I enjoyed a lot of it, but the stuff I disliked bothered me just as much.The two things that stood out to me the second time around, Bale's performance is amazing and they are idiots for underutilizing him. And the goats are the single worst thing in the entire MCU. Changing rating from 6 to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022, IMAX 7/20/2022)"
tt10648342,5.0,The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Zeus is a forgettable character in the movie. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.
tt0090305,6.0,"Even when John Hughes makes a mediocre film such as ""Weird Science,"" the nature of his intent still shines through, to the point where you can't necessarily fault him for anything except not making a better one. ""Weird Science"" serves as the ultimate 1980s high school nerd fantasy, one in which babes see social awkwardness as a turn-on and bullies and extortionist older brothers help themselves to large servings of humble pie. The movie truly doesn't need to be anything more, even in spite of the shallowness of its characters and general disregard for logic.Anthony Michael Hall (in his fourth Hughes film in three years) and Ilan Mitchell-Smith star as two losers who determine that if they can't get girls the ""old-fashioned"" way that they can use their computer smarts to play Frankenstein and create the ideal woman. After some illegal hacking they pack her with a high IQ (and an appropriate breast size) then hook a doll up to a machine. One crazy storm inside their house later and suddenly there's Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), who's every bit as stunning with a type A personality as a nerd could possibly imagine or desire.The story then goes the unexpected route. Lisa, equipped with mad street smarts and magic powers, literally takes over the driver's seat and the young Gary and Wyatt for a wild ride. After helping them loosen up a bit, she determines they need a few tests to find the courage they need to stand up to bullies and go after the girl.Hughes determines that Lisa needs no rhyme or reason other than causing an appropriate amount of mischief so the boys can learn a valuable thing or two. She's the fairy godmother of this fantasy; it's one thing to stand up to your parents, for example, and tell them you're going to a party, and it's another to have a hot model do it for you (and cause your father to forget who you are). Hughes basically sticks it to everyone who made his life crappy during his teens, though to be fair, he recognizes the nerd's shortcomings and doesn't paint them as heroes. Hughes has always played things close to the chest, filming most of his movies in the Chicago suburbs where he grew up, even naming the high school in ""Weird Science"" after the main road where his actual high school was. In this film he has absolute loony fun with his usual tropes, going as far as turning Bill Paxton, who plays Wyatt's militaristic older brother Chet, into a steaming pile of crap that looks like Jabba the Hut.Fans of the more romantic side of Hughes, who love his candid nature toward portraying high schoolers, might find ""Weird Science"" to be the wild mutt of the family with its irreverence, and high level of silliness. It could be considered the ""cult favorite"" of the Hughes collection and that's fine. It definitely caters to those who can relate to being a socially outcast teenage boy and not too many others, but by no means is it a slip-up for the coming-of-age master. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
tt0090305,6.0,"This is a very strange film. On one hand it's perfectly entertaining, but it's so bizarre and - to be blunt - utterly far-fetched and beyond-ridiculous that it actually kind of distracts from the entertainment value at times. The plot is so dumb - and the way it's handled - that suspension of disbelief is pretty hard.However, if you look at it as a realization of every teenage boy's fantasy, I guess it's all right.It's essentially about two 15-year-old boys (Ilan Michael-Smith and Anthony Michael Hall) who ""create"" a woman using electricity, a computer and a Barbie doll.This was my problem with the movie. John Hughes is usually great at character development and dialogue - but there's so little here. The setup is weak and the boys' decision to create a woman is handled waaaay too fast. And then the science behind their actions is ignored so much that it's almost insulting. The ""hacking"" of the computer mainframe that takes place during the Barbie doll's transformation into a human is classic '80s technology - they had no idea what a computer even was back then and as a result the ""hacking"" segment is basically an animated slideshow of cool images on the computer screen as Smith types noisily away on his keyboard.Their result? The beautiful supermodel Kelly LeBrock, who promptly takes a shower with the boys (their clothes are left on, of course, but hers are not) and then teaches them how to be cool, get girlfriends and so on.I was surprised by the amount of sexual content for a 1980s movie involving under-age teens. I've seen people say here on IMDb before that '80s movies couldn't get away with anything but that's not true. It may have been the Reagan era but this movie features 15-year-olds making out with a woman in her late '20s, sexual innuendo involving the woman (it's implied one of the two boys has some type of sexual contact with her during the first night), underage drinking, underage smoking, and then of course a classic scene that could never be filmed today - Anthony Michael Hall mimicking African-Americans in a seedy downtown bar.I don't mean to sound like a prude, I was just shocked at how much they got away with for a 1980s, PG-13 John Hughes comedy.The acting in the movie is decent. Anthony Michael Hall is a revelation, and his scenes as a drunk pimp in downtown Shermer are hilarious. He comes across as a true comical force, which I was surprised at considering he's not usually the leading man in films.On the other hand, Smith is poor - he smiles throughout the movie, even when he's supposed to be scared or angry. Maybe it was his first acting job and he was nervous or in disbelief, but it's kind of annoying.Bill Paxton is responsible for the movie's most memorable scenes. He is utterly hilarious and his scenes were usually the only ones I laughed out loud at.Overall this is one of Hughes' weakest films and it's probably because it was one of his more early directorial works. In terms of character development, ""The Breakfast Club"" reigns supreme. The dialogue isn't that great and the movie is too short and spends too little time with its setup. It's entertaining if you're not looking for anything of substance, but I think if Hughes had tackled this a few years down the road of his career the result would have been a bit more intelligent and memorable."
tt0117998,6.0,"A storm is brewing in the distance indeed, because some critics are hating this film. Directed by Jan de Bont, Twister (1996) stars Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Cary Elwes, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. It's kind of funny that the original tag-line for the film was going to be ""It sucks"" but the producers felt that it worked too much to the advantage of disappointed audiences and critics. It's doesn't really suck in a bad way. It's a very entertaining piece—not that good, but not that bad. Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt as an estranged couple who chase tornadoes for a living surprising the dialogue between them is funny and catchy—it's felt very well written for a disaster movie. We follow these storm-chasers during a wild 24-hour-period in a quest to deploy a large piece of scientific equipment in the path of a tornado, in hopes of studying it's traits from the inside with a rag-tag team of scientists. Each supporting cast of the movie's crew of storm-chasers has its bits of character develop stereotypes and exaggerated caricatures of real people. You have the smart guy with the map, the computer guy, the film and camera crew but most of all; you got Dusty play by Philip Seymour Hoffman. It's very cool to see him in a role where he doesn't take himself so serious, because most of his roles after this movie were a big serious. While, not chasing storms, the viewer are treated with a sub-story of Bill getting suck into the thrill of storm chasing, forcing him to reconnect an relationship with Josie (Helen Hunt's character) and ignoring his relationship with his new girlfriend. We get a back story of Helen Hunt's character reasons why she track storms, in a way to get revenge on them, for the death of her father who die from one. Then you got the story of the rivalry of competing storm-chasing teams lead by Carl Elwes. Carl Elwes plays also a caricature of the evil, corporation man who in it for money rather than science opposite of Bill's character. Without giving too much out away—it's incredibly entertaining. It's a very cookie-cutter popcorn flick. The CGI tornadoes were great at the time of filming, plus it's pretty real to me. It's eye candy. Just don't take the sum-story so serious, and enjoy yourself. You would be blow away how some critics deem it 'bad', and find yourself having fun watching it."
tt0117998,6.0,"Anyone who saw this movie in the theater or on a big screen TV will agree with me that ""Twister"" is an awesome thrill ride from beginning to end. However, if you watch this movie on a regular TV screen, you definitely don't get the full effect.  Sure the plot is about as predictable as a Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd cartoon. And sure Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt weren't A-list stars when this movie came out.   However, the special effects and uniqueness really make this film worthwhile.  You have to remember that when this movie came out in the summer of 1996,  it was a considered a big event movie.  Back then, a big budget/big event movie was considered a huge risk(i.e. Waterworld) and only came out about every 6 months.  Nowadays, it seems like every movie is or tries to be a big budget/big event movie.  Back then, the special effects in Twister were considered amazing and it was the first disaster movie to come out in a long time.  Nowadays, most movies have some kind of special effects in them and there are tons of disaster flicks made since Twister.  So, Twister was a ground breaking film and it really helped pave the way for all these high budget/special F/X films out right now."
tt0117998,6.0,"""Twister"" was the first geological disaster movie I'd ever seen. It was a cinematic success such to the degree that I believe it paved the way for the numerous geological disaster movies after it.Watching it again I didn't have quite the same euphoria as when I first saw it. Not that the CGI was lacking, because it was great for 1996, but I'd forgot all about the love triangle. I hate love triangles.Billy (Bill Paxton) just wanted his wife, Jo (Helen Hunt), to sign the divorce papers. He dragged his fiance, Melissa (Jamie Gertz), out to the remote location Jo was at to get the papers from her. Before he could get them nostalgia swept over him and the next thing you know he's chasing storms with his old crew with his unnerved fiance in tow.The next hour and a half was storm chasing with Bill and Jo settling in back to how they used to be and Melissa looking like a total third wheel. She couldn't have been more out of place. While the whole storm chasing crew was this wild bunch of thrill seekers, Melissa was the prude, neat, well-groomed, doctor who was easily rattled and completely out of her element with them and with the tornados.Billy and Melissa's split and Bill and Jo's reunion was so obviously foreshadowed that it's a wonder they waited two-thirds of the movie to make it happen. Hollywood loves to pretend her audience is made up of children who can't handle difficult situations. They had to make Melissa clearly a bad fit so that we'd all be OK with--or even pine for--Billy to split with Melissa and be with Jo. It's so patronizing.Billy and Jo get back together (because love), their a-hole competitor was killed (because jerks die), of their four tornado data devices all but the last one was destroyed (because suspense), the final tornado was an F5 (because drama), and he sacrificed his '96 Dodge Ram for the cause (because Dodges suck)."
tt0117998,5.0,"Love the tornadoes; can't stand the people. That about sums up this movie which I saw several times in a period of a few years. I enjoyed going back and re-visiting the tornado scenes. They are extremely entertaining.However, the characters in this movie are so annoying I was sorry the twisters didn't carry them all off to movie hell somewhere. Is there a dumber sounding male voice in Hollywood than Bill Paxton (with the exception of Keanu Reeves)?Are there more annoying people than the ones Helen Hunt plays? To make it really insufferable, Paxton and Hunt spend the entire movie yelling at each other. Can you find a supporting cast, people played by Jamie Gertz, etc., more stupid than the one in this story? Probably, but it won't be easy to find.Do what I did on the third and last viewing: just fast-forward (skip chapters on the DVD) to the disaster scenes and skip all the other garbage."
tt0117998,6.0,"Being from the west coast I never had a whole lot of interest in the natural phenomena showcased in this film. Where I live an inch of rain is headline news. I had absolutely no interest in Twister until I saw it was on late one boring night. Having nothing better to do, I obliged the television and payed attention. I found Twister to be what I call a nice bedtime movie. While it failed to anthropomorphize the tornado the way Backdraft successfully did with fire, the characters were well fleshed out, there was a healthy balance of comedy, drama and (at the time) cutting edge special FX. I found that as long as the viewer came in with no expectation, Twister would be a fun and easy to watch nappy time movie, perfect for watching on a rainy day, curled up with a blanket. So to sum everything up, don't expect an epic, emotionally charged extravaganza, but if you are willing to accept a decently woven story with reasonably believable characters, and have a rainy afternoon to kill, check out Twister. You shouldn't be too disappointed."
tt0117998,6.0,"I'll watch this again when cows fly. Yes indeed, flying cows, idiot scientists chasing tornadoes down Oklahoma dirt roads, a lovable Auntie Em High character who had towels until she served everybody steak and eggs for breakfasts, an urban legend concerning a movie drive-in theater, a Contraption dentist shoved up a tornado's butt name Dorothy add a dog in the opening scene that looks like Toto. What more could you want in a summer blockbuster? Taco where they are very friendly with each other, but soon to be exposed beams vapid fiancee who is completely out of place in the midwest, and twin tornados that I'm surprised they didn't nickname Minneapolis and St. Paul. Oh, did I mention that they were flying cows?You've got a bunch of teenagers watching The Shining on a drive in screen while Helen Hunt's beloved aunt, Lois Smith, watches Judy Garland and James Mason in ""A Star is Born"". This film has so much camp that it's impossible not to love it. Hunt is separated from husband bill paxton, but they are obviously still very close, one of the few times I've seen a couple divorcing in recent film history (fairly recent that is) where the ex-wife to be wasn't a shrew and where the soap opera of that divorce to be didn't dominate the film. Had other film producers followed the lead of this summer blockbuster, we would have been spared a ton of vapid Family characters in other disaster films such as ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""San Andreas"" and ""2012"", not to mention all those hideously bad Asylum films.Certainly, as far as they are as scientists, hunt and Paxton are not the brightest tcole with common sense as they literally get under the tornadoes, something that would instantly kill others, especially if they smashed into a cow at 100 miles an hour. Jami Gertz plays the most vapid, idiotic character, obviously a big city working girl who is just extremely shallow in nature and has to realize that she'll never win Paxton's love as long as Hunt is around. The big-hearted character played by Lois Smith is a wonderful part for the veteran stage actress, who was still working in 2020, becoming the oldest Tony winner in history. I really wanted to see more of her. When she declares, ""I'm going to drive myself"" after being pulled out of her collapse house, I just wanted to hug her.This probably is the best disaster film of the past 30 years, although a few of the ones that I mentioned above had great disaster sequences. But even though I hate the trope of marital issues guiding the background of films like this, here it worked. The special effects are phenomenal and the use of intended humor does make the film fly by. As ridiculous as the two lead characters are, it's impossible not to root for them. It's a film that I had fun laughing at yet cheering along, add in paying tribute to the cows who flew across the highways or ended up on everybody's plates at Smith's farm, I give this two hooves up."
tt24068064,6.0,"I really enjoy when an actor who is labeled a hot chick ""heartthrob"" (Sydney Sweeney), comes out and nails a lead role in a feature like this. She knocks the ball out of the park on this one. I would recommend this to fans of hers or high level acting in general.This film is essentially a one setting play (with some flashbacks). It's filmed in a way where you feel like you're there just watching the events. It's definitely not for everyone, and the overall plot is very basic and not something I'm particularly interested in (Russian BS/politics), but I didn't watch for that.This film is good at driving tension, slowly and unfolding, almost backwards the events that did, in fact occur. If you enjoy good acting, watch it!"
tt24068064,6.0,"I didn't know anything about this case before I saw the film, so when I saw ""Reality Winner"" and FBI - well, I was expecting a sort of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" type scenario. Nope, nothing like. That is the real name of a woman (Sydney Sweeney) who worked for the American government translating Iranian documents. She arrives home one day to find ""Garrick"" (Josh Hamilton) and ""Taylor"" (Marchánt Davis) parked on her lawn with a warrant to search her, her home, her car... She's bemused and a bit nonplussed, especially as her visitors seem way more concerned about the wellbeing of her cat and her dog! Anyway, into the house they eventually go and the interrogation begins. For a while, there is quite an effective intensity to that process and using, as it does, the original transcript of the interview as it happened, it delivers an authentic looking presentation of just how effective these agents can be. It's history, so there's no jeopardy - and I think Sweeney turns in quite a strong performance as the plot thickens but it all takes far too long to get going and the production is all just a bit too staccato. The thread does go some way to revealing the intimidatory powers of Uncle Sam when he feels aggrieved and that makes for uncomfortable watching at times. It isn't an especially memorable drama, and it doesn't need a cinema - but it will be fine to watch on the television whilst posing a few questions about what is or is not in the ""public interest""."
tt0120772,6.0,"Screenwriter Wendy Wasserstein, adapting Stephen McCauley's novel, begins with a premise which is pure formula: an unmarried mother-to-be in New York City would rather raise her child with her gay best friend rather than with the baby's father. What appears to be a continuation of themes begun with 1997's ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" fortunately leads to a sensitive, perceptive straight/gay platonic romance pre-""Will & Grace"". A large part of the film's success belongs to Jennifer Aniston (an easy presence on the screen) and Paul Rudd (who is charming without effort, even if some of his dialogue is a little cloying). There's also a moving story thread involving Nigel Hawthorne as an elderly gay man who is cruelly dumped-on by his young lover that shows the sometimes fickle nature inherent in gay relationships, handled with quiet taste by director Nicholas Hytner. Despite a downright peculiar finish (which gives new meaning to the term ""feel good""), ""The Object of My Affection"" is a sweet, insightful comedy-drama that gets into that curious area not many movies are willing to investigate: why many straight women are drawn to having gay men as best friends, what the two have in common and, ultimately, what actions cross that invisible line between loyalty and disillusionment (which has its basis in disappointment on the woman's part that the fantasy cannot come true). Not everything works in ""Affection"", but it is remarkably pleasant and (for better or worse) hetero-friendly. **1/2 from ****"
tt0120772,6.0,"I thought that this film was terrific.  I read the book years ago, and actually thought that the movie was better.  First of all, it makes more sense to look at the storyline from Nina's perspective, since she has much more at stake than George does. Secondly, the character played by Nigel Hawthorne was beautifully written and played, and he didn't even exist in the book.  I also disagree with the assertion that George was ""boring"" in this movie.  I thought that Paul Rudd gave a wonderful and moving performance, particularly at the Science Fair when he tells Nina how much he would love to be a father.  Don't believe the critics -- give it a rental.  It's a terrific film."
tt0120772,6.0,"Adapted from the book of the same name by Stephen McCauley, 'The Object of My Affection' rests on a great, novel idea, but somehow it falters, in its execution. Its certainly a decent film with good performances, but the idea deserved more.'The Object of My Affection' Synopsis: A pregnant New York social worker begins to develop romantic feelings for her gay best friend, and decides she'd rather raise her child with him, much to the dismay of her overbearing boyfriend.'The Object of My Affection' is about finding comfort in a partner, despite their sexuality. The protagonist here, pregnant & rather lonely, finds comfort & commitment in a gay man, to whom, she offers to father her child. Now, that's a different way of looking at things, but its a great concept. The clichés of the hero & heroine are done away here & what is served here is a tale of love, despite both the sexes ever indulging sexually. However, 'The Object of My Affection' is hurdled by an erratic Screenplay. The Late/Great Wendy Wasserstein's Adapted Screenplay stagnates after a point. Of course, the lighthearted tone is wonderfully maintained & the film begins very well, but you wish the Writer had opted for a little more. The final 30-minutes, in particular, aren't impressive enough. I wanted more of the interaction between the unlikely couple, rather than newer characters & their importance. Nicholas Hytner's Direction is fine. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is alright. Art & Costume Design are perfect. George Fenton's Score is passable.Performance-Wise: Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd are in complete form. Aniston is natural to the core & makes you feel for her love towards a man who isn't attracted to her, while Rudd is magic as her companion, who also loves her, but just not the way she expects. Their on-screen chemistry, also, is easy. John Pankow is first-rate. Veterans Allison Janney & Alan Alda are adequate. Steve Zahn has a very small role, but he's effective, as always.On the whole, 'The Object of My Affection' isn't as brave as it should've been, nonetheless, its a breezy watch."
tt0160862,6.0,"Silly but fun teen romantic comedy about a high school jock (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) who bets his friend (Paul Walker) that he can turn a geek (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the prom queen. Flimsy updating of Pygmalion is hard to hate. It doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Yeah it's absolutely ridiculous that Rachael Leigh Cook, an exceptionally pretty girl, would be considered unattractive just because she wears glasses and overalls. But you just roll with it because it's cute and fun. The cast is very likable and the script is good for this type of movie. Matthew Lillard steals pretty much every scene he's in. It's fluff but you'll be smiling when it's over. Can't see the harm in that."
tt0160862,6.0,"When I saw this film a couple of years ago, I was sixteen, I sort of loved it. Seeing it again, not in my teenage years anymore, I realize that 'She's All That' really is for teenagers. I still like it, yes, but now that I have seen so many more movies there are a lot of predictable, therefore lesser, parts.For starters it is set on a high school but the characters seem to be in their mid-twenties. Of course that is pretty logical since the actors are in their mid-twenties. Well, Rachael Leigh Cook was only twenty, and I have to admit that she is the main reason to see this movie if you are a guy. Freddie Prinze Jr. is her love interest and personally I think he is one of the most annoying actors out there, no exception here.The whole story is very predictable actually. Prinze is the most popular guy on their high school, just dumped by his beautiful girlfriend. Now he makes a bet with a friend: he can turn any girl into a prom queen. The friend selects the girl and of course he chooses Rachael Leigh Cook. Convenient for Prinze, since she already is a beautiful girl. It does not really matter whether she wears glasses and floppy pants. Of course he really falls in love with her, of course the bet comes out, of course the girl is mad, of course the movie end on the prom, and of course it will be a happy ending.Yes, predictable it is, but also sweet, even with an actor like Prinze. Sometimes it is funny and when you are watching a romantic comedy all you really want, I guess, is the main characters get together in a nice way. That sort of happens. A teenager will probably love it, but others will not completely waste their time."
tt0160862,6.0,"A pretty good movie loosely based on the 60's musical 'My Fair Lady' where an ugly duckling becomes a swan. The only problem I saw with the casting is that the duckling (Rachael Leigh Cook) had twice the looks of the Swan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) at the start of the movie. The acting is pretty good, although Matthew Lillard overacts as usual. A simple feel good movie."
tt0160862,5.0,"While I would never put this film up with the contender teen flicks (American Pie for instance), if there was a pick between this and Bring it On, I'd go for the first.  The story follows a smart, preppy, and popular teen (Freddie Prinze Jr.) called Zach who gets dumped by his girlfriend, but then takes a bet the to turn a outsider art girl (Rachel Leigh Cook has some great charm and sexuality) into prom queen.  While I wouldn't call this the best idea to turn someone's mindset like that, the film makes it almost work, and slightly (though never completely) makes Zach's lifestyle apealing.  Sweet romantic comedy, though it isn't a quality flick. B-"
tt0160862,5.0,"When high school jock Zak is dumped by his prom-queen style girlfriend, he rashly says that he doesn't need her and that any girl he dates will become the prom queen.  A friend takes her up on the bet and picks geeky art student Laney.  Zak tries to get close with limited success but gradually he begins to get to know her and they become friends  now all he has to do is get her accepted by the jet set.How many teen movies do we need, with their similar themes of jocks and geeks and the seemingly revolving casts?  Here we get yet another retelling of Pygmalion except here it doesn't really convince as a comedy or a story. The plot isn't particularly imaginative and feels lifeless and a little flat as a result like it has no spark of it's own.  The other problem is the fact that Laney is actually quite good looking before `the change'  I prefer her look before Zak supposedly made her better.The film needs to pander to the teen audience so we get the obligatory `gross out' comedy in a few scenes which are funny but outside of that it's really very light melodrama between Zak, Laney and the jocks/cheerleaders.Prince is annoying but is actually alright here despite having a cardboard jock character.  Cook is good as Laney but it's a shame that the film sees some sort of victory of making this geeky arty girl into a beautiful Valley girl type that conforms to the pack.  What message does that send out to teenagers?  At one point Zak says that he'd rather work with fat or ugly than Laney  but really she is only acceptable because she is pretty and not fat or ugly.  The rest of the cast are a range of teen actors who you'll recognise from other films who do nothing out of the ordinary.  Usher has a cool cameo  but why did Lil' Kim take a role that was barely a support character?  I hate Matthew Lillard with a passion but here he does a good job sending up those reality TV `celebrities' and is very funny in his handful of scenes.Overall this is an acceptable teen film but really never gets to the point where you could call it more than good.  The story lacks spark or imagination and the comedy is either crude or too slight to be funny.  It's watchable but it's not all that."
tt0160862,6.0,"I'd actually recommend seeing it if you don't feel like a heavy movie and just want to watch something fun. The movie is 'another teen movie"" but does have some unique aspects to it, some pretty funny quotes (""what is this, the dork outreach program?"")and moments, but unfortunately, a lot of that average teen movie drama and a few overly two-dimensional characters (Zach's friends and girlfriend). Cool dance scene though, and Freddie Prinze Jr. is bearable Rachel Leigh Cook is likable (I personally thought she was pretty good in it) and notably talented actors like Kevin Pollak, Kieran Culkin, and Anna Paquin give the movie some supporting foundation. Not a bad movie, not a great movie, just simply what it is:'another teen movie'."
tt4263482,6.0,"... because the amount of 10/10 is very confusing to me. The overuse of the term ""Masterpiece"" as well. It is not a bad movie, the hour and a half went by fast, the cinematography is beautiful and the acting is good, but I must say I was expecting more intensity in the characters or in the plot. Not necessarily ""scary"" things or jumpscares, which I hate, but simply more depth. The witch character was intriguing and I wish we had seen more of her. Overall I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again because I don't think there's more to be analyzed, I dont think the cinematography is fantastic enough to rewatch it either, I didn't get attached to the characters... In short, it is a good movie but doesn't quite deliver after seeing all these 10/10 reviews. I do have to say that the last movie I watched was Midsommar, which blew me away, so compared to it this movie is pretty bland."
tt4263482,6.0,"I feel like I can't come up with the right words to describe this incredible movie, but I'll try. The lingering atmosphere is done incredibly well from the beginning, helped along by a combination of a tense score and the use of extended periods of silence. The acting is bang-on and you don't know when or how it is going to end. The movie doesn't have 'twists' exactly, but the way it is written keeps you guessing constantly. And I personally loved the ending. Though the potential is there to use a more standard approach, The Witch however opts to go down a more subtle avenue, leading to the true nature of religious persecution that is on full display here. Additionally, elements of the story have been taken from historical documents, adding another layer of grimness. The supernatural elements are obviously up for discussion, but that these tales were written centuries ago somehow adds more to this disturbing film.The film is set in 1630, in New England, America. A Puritan family is banished from town for their beliefs (or it at least seems this way, perhaps based on real events). They are forced to move to a farm that feels like it is on the edge of the world, as from the opening the woods that line the farm are presented in ominous fashion, almost creating a character that could serve as the scariest element of the film. What exactly goes on in there? Why can't the children venture inside? Suddenly, without warning, tragedy strikes. The family clings to their faith to prevent them from starving as their crops die; with nothing they can do to prevent it.The period is an appropriate choice given how humans treated each other centuries ago, and an ideal setting for a horror tale. Some conversations require a little more attention, as the characters speak in 'ye olde English' which takes a little getting used to, but it adds another layer of mystery as the family is struck by more inexplicable hardships, causing them to become wary of each other, which in turn leaves them in a increasingly vulnerable state. I can't say I is scared, but I do know that I is gripping the armrests pretty hard for most of the film. Hell, they manage to make a scene where a man is hunting a rabbit seem tense and creepy! Additionally, this is not for inattentive viewers; I could see clock-watching all around me. The incredible camera-work almost reminds me of Paul Thomas Anderson in There Will Be Blood, with many long takes, often slowly panning or zooming in. There is also a focus on facial close-ups reminiscent of Bergman, all of which is a feast to watch on an IMAX screen. The score matches this camera-work almost to perfection, while there is often a lengthy silence between dialogue to contrast the tense music. It also must be mentioned that the child actors really shine, out-doing their older counterparts.This really is my sort of horror film. No jump-scares, convincing acting and a focus on a dark, foreboding atmosphere rather than the grotesque and bloody. This is another of those films I would label as a psychological thriller, as the supernatural horrors are kept almost completely out of view as we witness the downfall of a family who are all affected, turning on each other as their faith is truly tested.This film couldn't have catered to my interests more; I can't recommend it to everybody, but if you go in with no preconceived notions you'll be in for a tasty, if not nasty surprise. The suspense is almost unparalleled among recent films, and the 'horror' genre conventions are cleverly subverted to deliver a film that is better than 'It Follows' while being a completely different film. In addition to all this, there is much to take in thematically if you are so inclined Hell, I'd love to see this again to do just that.www.epilepticmoondancer.net"
tt4263482,5.0,"The good: Visually speaking the movie is done really well. The cinematography is really good. There's a very dark creepy atmosphere. The acting is also good. The actors are doing a good job. Seems they worked really hard on this.Unfortunately that's where the good ends. Lately I've been seeing more and more movies like this one. Good atmosphere with zero plot. The storyline is just plain boring. The entire movie is built on religious babbling and paranoia. Old time superstitions and no real substance. You get the idea really fast and after that there's nothing. No story, no characters development, nothing. It took me two days to finish watching the movie because I was bored. I even considered stop watching it but I wanted to know if there was a point. Something I didn't see. Well, there wasn't.Now, just to be clear, I understand the premise of the movie. It basically shows the hardships of the period. The struggles, the faith, the superstitions etc. There's a lot of symbolism in the film. They are trying to show us what it was like and how people thought back then but that said, the bottom line is this: if a horror movie is boring then it's just not doing its job. Maybe as a creepy historical drama it could have worked somehow but I'm not even sure how. Truthfully, reading about the movie was more interesting than actually watching it. It's a real missed opportunity imho.So while it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's also not a great one. I actually think that with more work on the script this movie could have easily been a great one but because there's no real substance, real storyline it just misses the mark. Can't really recommend it. Sorry."
tt10954984,6.0,"6.7/10While ""Nope"" is a visual spectacle I found that it didn't sit as well as I would've hoped when it came to the story. However, it still manages to reach its goal of entertaining on some level.The film felt slightly long due to the first and third acts feeling fast and somewhat stuffed with a lot of goings ons while the second act felt very slow and drawn out. The long parts put me into a state of boredom, and even further than that, once the reveal of the antagonist happened, the magic and tension disappeared. Before that tension disappeared I found there was some good tension built up due to the soundtrack, but again, things fell short.As for the horror parts, I assumed there would be more than just the ones shown in the commercial, and while there was, again a lot of the horror/magic disappeared once the antagonist was shown.I did find the acting to be very engaging. Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer each brought great energy to their roles, and the supporting actors were equally enjoyable.Overall, a decent film, but if I could go back I would wait to see it on a cheap night. Acting was enjoyable, the cinematography was spectacular, but the story, the length of the film, and the antagonist weren't up to the par I was expecting.Thank you for reading my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"
tt10954984,6.0,"I surmise that the idea for ""Nope"" came out of a clever idea for a sketch. Imagine a film where the main character says ""Nope"" to terrifying, unexplainable phenomena instead of rushing forward like a courageous, but dumb movie hero.Except, bucking that trope only takes a movie so far. And that's the point where the movie ""Nope"" starts to unravel, when it can't adequately explain why the protagonists are sticking around.Somewhere between halfway and three fourths of the movie, the dialogue just becomes far too cryptic to make sense of. And that's the point where the actions the protagonists are taking really needs to be clear, as it's the climax of the film.I wished the director Jordan Peele, one half of the successful Key and Peele comedy duo, would try his hand at the horror/comedy movie genre. I believe this is his third and latest film, and the second one that most fits in that genre.To his credit, some sequences have great cinematography, tension, and horror. And some moments are really funny. One particular sequence is both terrifying and hilarious, and best encapsulates the title ""Nope,"" as a main character goes head to head with a massive, intimidating force and just closes his car door, and says ""nope.""But overall, the horror and comedy sides do not feel totally woven together. It's like at some point budget was lost and some sequences just couldn't get follow through. And the characters had to be stretched to make up for missing plot points, or fill the moments with comedy. The writers and actors and visual effects teams are good enough so they manage it. But there is a sense of ""what did I just watch"" at the ending, which wasn't there with Peele's two other more finished films.Whatever the back story is that has given ""Nope"" its rough landing, I still found the film enjoyable. Sometimes experimental. Mostly unpretentious and original good fun. But also, what did I just watch?"
tt10954984,5.0,"Jordan Peele's Nope has been compared to a Spielberg extravaganza such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Conceptually it is closer to M Night Shyamalan. With a central premise about fame.Some of the characters have been involved in the tv and film industry. Others are chasing fame such as news and reality tv.OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is a rancher and horse wrangler. Together with his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) they need to do something about their struggling business after the sudden death of their father who was hit by some falling debris.There are the strange death of their horses. They have had to sell some horses to their neighbour Ricky 'Jupe' Park (Steven Yeun) a former child actor who now operates a Western theme park.The possibility of UFO activity out there could be the sibling's salvation. Hoping to recapture footage of the impossible could be a way to make a fortune.Like a Shyamalan movie, Nope is told in a leisurely pace like some modern western before the horror/sci fi part cranks up.It is not without flaws. I am bemused why Emerald sounds like some person who grew up in the hood. It is jarring.When the alien attacks takes place, there is a lack of law enforcement, army and media activity.Jupe's past as a child actor where a chimpanzee went on a rampage sits oddly. It was like walking into a David Lynch film.Nope is odd, stilted and strangely beguiling. It is hard to overlook the flaws."
tt10954984,6.0,"I hope we are not about to see the Shyamalan effect with Jordan Peele, where the debut film is amazing and everything that follows leaves you scratching your head. I feel like I'm on that road with Peele's body of silver screen work. ""Get Out"" was a masterpiece, while ""Us"" jus didn't do it for me and now ""Nope!""Keke Palmer did her thing in the role she played (she is the star of this movie for sure) and Daniel kept up with a good performance in his own right, but the film itself was something outta the Twilight Zone. More of a sci-fi thriller than a horror flick, it had too many holes and unanswered questions for my liking. Peele's approach to filmmaking is amazing, much like Shyamalan, but the stories, like Shyamalan's are starting to fall short of being good films.Jordan may have dreamt this story and woke up at 5am and jotted down every detail he could remember. And like our weird dreams, they never make any sense and we forget a lot of the details by the time we wake up! Nope was like one of those weird a... dreams!"
tt10954984,5.0,"The credits have just rolled, and despite running for two hours, it's felt as if it's been on for about four hours.I can't remember the last time I was so conflicted about a film, the good elements were great, the bad elements were painful, I'll try to be as concise as I can.I'll start with the great elements, first off, production values are terrific, this is one gorgeously produced film, it looks terrific.The second aspect that stood out, the acting, Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer were terrific, and I really enjoyed Brandon Perea's performance too.The storyline itself was a good one, if nothing highly original, I liked that whole monkey scenario, and the way it developed was very satisfying, the sci fi fan in me appreciated several of the key elements, I loved not knowing exactly what was behind that cloud, that aspect worked well.Unfortunately, it lacked scares, listed as a horror, this was anything but, I wanted thrills and spills, this was more a casual prod. Pacing was definitely an issue, it was just way too slow in parts. Many scenes simply didn't make any sense.It reminded me of The Cloverfield Paradox, definitely some interesting elements, but too slow and just felt too cobbled together.Not bad, but it should have been so much better.5/10."
tt10954984,6.0,"It starts off a little humorous, thought the directing was great to take it from there into a more tense, on edge film. I however don't think this is horror, more of sci-fi but unlike sci-fi movies this one didn't really expose much of the otherworldly parts of it, which was great in the beginning because it built up suspense but since we don't learn much about the ""alien"" you're left with more questions than answers which annoyed me. Thought the premise of the movie was going to be hard to pull off since it's set in the middle of nowhere but they did. Story telling is good and paced well, I love how they added the chimpanzee story arc but I'm disappointed that was the most gruesome part in the movie. You don't get to see how the alien got there, why OJ somehow figured it's territorial, what is actually happening inside the ship, or how Jupe and his wife's circus ruckus never stirred up more attention on previous occasions.... in short, it lacks depth and I think it would have elavated it from just a good movie to a great one.The performances were amazing, loved how calm Kaluya's character was, felt realistic for me. It's often said black people don't usually feature in horrors because once something's fishy we dip, but if we didn't I think this was a more realistic take by the whole cast, upped the rating for me. Peele's concept and directing was great, it was great to see a horror that's not leaning on jump-scares. But as I said this isn't a horror, not in the typical sense of making you scared to turn off the lights to sleep; but it's the nearest genre you could put it in other than sci-fi. I think movies like this, or The invisible man, Ready or not, Midsommer, Fresh, maybe even Us aren't really horrors and a sub genre should be found; because you expect to be scared when you watch a horror so it feels mis-categorized. Nope felt more like a psychological sci-fi thriller or drama than actual horror.There was a good movie in here, it just needed more development and depth to go along with everything else the movie did right, it's like when you have a brilliant idea but don't think it through in detail so it just comes off shallow."
tt10954984,5.0,"The way most critics are raving about ""Nope"" makes me wonder if I've been the victim of an elaborate prank where I was shown a different film than what they have been watching.Because ""Nope"" is, at best, adequate -- a watchable sci-fi action picture that, if it weren't for the fact that it's directed by an Oscar-winning red-hot director and has a budget of roughly $60 mil and stars an Oscar-winning actor, would not be out of place among the myriad of B-movies that litter the virtual shelves of Netflix or Prime Video.First, the good stuff: the film looks gorgeous. Lots of beautiful shots of cloudy skies and spectacular night and day vistas. It was shot on Imax cameras by a master (Hoyte Van Hoytema, Christopher Nolan's regular cinematographer), and it shows. And the dark, foreboding imagery helps Jordan Peele build some effective tension during the first half of the film, when the audience (and the film's characters) still don't know exactly what's going on and what exactly is threatening them.But then the film devolves into a mess where everyone (including the main antagonist) behaves illogically because that's what the plot requires them to do in order to hit all the subtextual marks that Jordan Peele wants them to deliver. And therein lies the biggest problem with the film: it's a very unsubtle 'message' movie, and Jordan Peele, really wants you to get what he's trying to say, to the point of driving the point home with a hammer, over and over.Without going into spoiler territory, the film's plot is a not-so-veiled metaphor for the state of entertainment in our society. All the characters have some sort of connection to the entertainment industry in some form and/or are meant to symbolize a facet of it: the protagonists are two African American siblings, one of whom runs the family business, a ranch providing horses for Hollywood movies; the other is a wannabe performer/entertainer.Their business is dying: animals are being supplanted by CGI, and horses can be unpredictable on set and hard to control, and therefore replaceable. Any parallel with the perception of people of color in the same industry is of course not accidental. Then you have the kid who works at (now defunct) Fry's Electronics and is all about digital videos and streaming content. His name is Angel, probably because calling him YouTube or TikTok would have been a tad too transparent. Then there's the the grizzled, obsessed old filmmaker (played by Michael Wincott, your go-to guy when you want someone who looks gruff and curmudgeonly, down to the 'I just swallowed drain cleaner' hoarse voice) who is disillusioned with the drivel he's forced to shoot nowadays and is ready to roll with his trusty hand-cranked non-digital film camera and to sacrifice everything to the altar of cinematic art.We also have the Asian cowboy slash circus entertainer (Steven Yeun) who suffered a traumatic event as a child actor which left him with deep unhealed psychological scars simmering under the surface, which all stereotypical ex-child actors are supposed to have and which of course will lead him to make horribly wrong, life-changing decisions. And, in what is the most transparent cypher in film packed to the gills with them, you have a TMZ reporter that is not even given a name or a face: he just shows up at some point on an electric motorcycle wearing a reflective helmet (get it? He's just mirroring society's obsession with capturing celebrities' life! Hoo boy!) and expensive cameras. And of course we all know how Hollywood feels about paparazzi, so if you can't guess what's going to happen to him, you will love this film unironically.Nobody in the film behaves the way a regular human being would. They do things because Jordan Peele needs them to deliver a message to the audience, logic and common sense be damned. I'm not even sure the film takes place in the real world, since all the events seem to involve only this microcosm of characters and nobody else. It's like a Beckett play, except that the stage is a vast valley in the California desert inhabited only by a handful of people and the outside world doesn't exist and is somehow unaware of the very visible and bizarre events taking place.Imagine if Jaws took place in the California desert and the shark had a message against Hollywood and showbiz consumerism painted in bright neon letters on its side, and Brody, Quint and Hooper were replaced by much less competent characters whose purpose is not to kill the man-eating menace but to take pictures of it so they can sell it to Oprah and become rich, and you'll have a pretty good idea of the basic plot of ""Nope"" (and the Jaws comparisons don't end there -- you'll see what I mean at the end of the film).As a scary movie, Nope is pretty devoid of actual scares (Peele has to resort to the oldest trick in the book, the 'jump scare', in a couple of occasions). It's also surprising tame in the blood and gore department (most of the carnage takes place offscreen).The talented cast does what they can with the material. Daniel Kaluuya's OJ is nicely understated: a no-nonsense guy who seems to react to most of the craziness around him with a shrug or by saying ""nope"" (of course). Kiki Palmer is fine as his sister, though in typically cliched fashion, she suddenly switches from ""shrieking, terrified woman"" to ""resourceful heroine"" when the plot demands it. But they can't save the film because they have to go through the motions of a plot that becomes increasingly preposterous (the plan that they devise in the third act makes no sense the more you think about it)
Nope continues the downward trajectory of Jordan Peele after Get Out and Us. The former, still a modern masterpiece, succeeded because the metaphorical subtext didn't get in the way of the plot: even if you completely ignored the clear references to slavery and race relationships, it still worked perfectly as a basic thriller.Us was where we started getting hints Peele's ambition might exceed his grasp (it was deliciously creepy and well executed, but the basic concept of a race of ""alternate"" underground dwelling doppelgangers was too bonkers and forced to work)
And now we have Nope, where nothing makes sense outside of its function as a delivery system for Peele's criticism of Hollywood, its treatment of minorities, and our society's total dependence on entertainment at all costs.I've seen critics make favorable comparison between Jordan Peele and Steven Spielberg (mainly due to the very evident influence of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the aforementioned ""Jaws), but a more apt comparison would be with M. Night Shyamalan, another director who hit the jackpot early in his career with a terrific movie and then proceeded to squander his potential with increasingly ambitious and less effective muddled message films.In many ways, Nope is Jordan Peele's ""Signs"". Still enjoyable in parts, but too self-conscious for its own good and a far cry from the promise shown with Get Out."
tt0103772,6.0,"Michael Douglas plays San Francisco detective Nick Curran, who is investigating the brutal icepick murder of rock star Johnny Boz, which leads him to his girlfriend, novelist Catherine Tramell(Sharon Stone, unforgettable) Nick, though suspicious of Catherine, is nonetheless attracted to her brazen sensuality, and they begin a torrid affair, even though more murders pile up, and Catherine proves to be quite manipulative and intelligent...is she guilty? Controversial film directed by Paul Verhoeven is never boring, though normally having no one in the story to root for would be a problem, film is so slickly made and in-your-face that it may be the epitome of the guilty pleasure; trashy yet enjoyable. Both lead actors are excellent though, even if the mystery is never satisfactorily resolved."
tt0103772,5.0,"Sharon Stone struggled in supporting roles in mostly unsatisfactory movies for years before she became an ""overnight sensation"" in director Paul Verhoeven's rather inelegant crime-drama. Contrived plot about a brazen, bisexual novelist who may have committed murder isn't particularly witty or clever or fresh, but it takes sexual matters head-on, and this managed to titillate a lot of viewers. Michael Douglas is the police detective who is drawn to Stone's writer despite or because of her scary straightforwardness, but we never get a sense of him as a character: is this hard-working guy (with an amazing amount of free time at his disposal) so benumbed by his profession that it takes a she-demon like Stone to turn him on? If so, wouldn't this affect his relationships with other women? (colleague Jeanne Tripplehorn seems not to notice). Stone's bisexuality is just window-dressing, as are the sex scenes themselves, mainly because the story itself isn't fully fleshed out (it resorts to the hoariest of clichés, like dragging out the protagonist's college graduation photos!). Verhoeven's direction is predictably wired but not especially tantalizing--the film plays like sub-Adrian Lyne--and the film's high budget doesn't account for the depressingly flat look of the picture, including pulpy-cartoon set-ups and lighting that seem to invite unwelcomed laughs. The whole film is a tacky titter. ** from ****"

The CGI effects are pretty special, but personally I often get bored when the CGI effects are the only thing keeping a movie afloat. And there are basically only 2 CGI spectacle scenes that are noteworthy and even those I found somewhat overkill and boring.Let's forget about the story. This is merely another adventure movie, like the Pirates of the Carribean meets National Treasure. It'll do if there is nothing else to watch, but dont expect any originality, dont expect many laughs and dont expect much thrillling action either..."
tt1464335,5.0,"After many years we finally have an Uncharted film, this film is based on the really popular video game franchise and today I have watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man getting recruited to go on a hunt for a long lost treasure.Main Character
Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake and I can't help myself he is really entertaining to watch and I think this is just because of Holland's natural charm and charisma manages to drag him through. But the issue is that he just isn't what I wanted from Nathan Drake as a character, he is nothing like his video game counterpart and that is a big shame. I was watching the film and all I saw was Peter Parker just without his Spider-Man costume. Hopefully, this is only because this film came out just after Spider-Man: No Way Home but I do worry that Holland might become typecast and a one trick pony.Supporting Characters
Mark Wahlberg plays Sully and it is a similar story to our main character. He has plenty of natural charisma to him and his chemistry with Holland is really good and at least there is some sort of character development on show. But I felt like it was Mark Wahlberg walking around and the character of Sully from the video games and that was the issue for me, he is just the same as he is in every other film and this is a slight shame for me. Sophia Ali plays Chloe and I actually quite liked her, maybe because she was the one performer I didn't recognise made her feel like an actual character and somebody who was actually interesting to watch. The bad guys didn't work though, Antonio Banderas is here but he is just your generic villain and I don't know when but it seems like when a European bad guy is needed then he is the one cast and it just didn't work here. Tai Gabrielle is better as a villain but she isn't that great either but was at least a physical enemy to Drake.Story
The story did a pretty good job of showing a young Nathan Drake starting his career and leading us on a fun adventure story across the globe that had shades of Indiana Jones to it. There is some sort of character development attempted and the actors seemed like they were having fun here. But there is a lack of depth and direction for the overall plot of the film. I think it could needed to pace itself a bit better and focus on the characters a bit more and give the villains way better motivations.Script
The film actually has a surprising amount of humour to it and I was chuckling my way through most of the film, mixed with a bit of heart made this alright. But there isn't enough here, I didn't care about the characters enough and sometimes it felt like the film relied on its star power instead of actually crafting these better written heroes and villains.Style
The style has some really good action scenes, including the crazy cargo plane scene that was in all of the trailers. The film is quite relentless too, the adventure moves at a pretty break neck pace which is good but it also harms the characterisation and plot of the film. It was a fun action film without the depth needed to become a good film.Overall
Overall, Uncharted is a pretty average adventure film. There is some good here for sure and Sony are hoping to make this a franchise but it doesn't do enough for me to get me excited for that or recommend this for a watch.Rating - 5/10."
tt1464335,5.0,"I actually enjoyed this movie. But after hearing fans of the game talking about the weird casting. I have to take a couple of points off. I mean, you should always try to keep the fans happy. As well as bringing in newcomers.So Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are totally wrong choises for these characters here. Holland in particular is really just the same as he is in Spiderman, and that's maybe what the money people wanted.Outside of the actors though, I was expecting this to be a CGI heavy mess. And though there is alot of CGI in its later parts. I still liked the action in the movie. The plane scene does feel like it belongs more in a game. But some of the realistic action, and the over the top finale were well done. You'll be entertained if you have no interest in the games I guess."
tt1464335,5.0,"I've heard dozens of people compare this to Indiana Jones. I think a more apt comparison would include the Da Vinci Code in the conversation. Yes, it has some of the fun adventure set-pieces we expect; the helicopter-ship fight & hanging-out-of-plane scenes are mindlessly well-executed cinematic absurdity. Sadly, it's made disposable by colorless characters & a parade of explorer movie cliches & MacGuffins that even a long-haired Hanks (much less the miscast Wahlberg/Holland duo) couldn't make work."
tt1464335,6.0,"The Uncharted video game franchise is my favourite series of games ever made. I thought I should get that out of the way before diving into my review. Upon the countless storylines I'm sure they went over and numerous directors leaving the project before settling on Ruben Fleischer, I was worried, but still very excited to see these characters on the big screen. This will also be a completely unbiased review because I can't even compare it to the games. Too many things have been changed to really compare it. With all of that said, let's dive in.The story begins with young Nathan Drake, a bartender who had one day planned on finding treasure with his brother Sam. After the disappearance of his brother, he never felt the need to get back into the game. When Victor Sullivan (Sully) appears after his shift one night, he brings up the past, saying that he worked with his brother Sam. This instantly makes Nathan want to be a part of this story and the two of them form a bond. These two believe that a fortune left behind by Ferdinand Magellan over 500 years ago is still sitting somewhere in the world. They take this journey together, but they're not the only ones after this treasure, which leads to a lot of predictability as well.When I first heard that Tom Holland was cast to play Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg would be playing Sully, I, like many other fans, was left scratching my head. It was clear that they wanted to start these characters younger than they were in the game in order to build a long-running franchise, but it just didn't seem right. Again, I'm wasn't about to let my love of the games sway me in any direction though. I'm a huge fan of both Holland and Wahlberg, so here's the catch-22 happening in my head. Did I enjoy this movie overall and did I enjoy these two in their respective roles? I absolutely did! Do I still feel that it was a little miscast and that they should've been older? I absolutely do! For both of those reasons and for a few negatives I'm about to get into, I believe Uncharted is an okay, entertaining movie for the most part.Ruben Fleischer has been a very hit-or-miss director for me, directing both Zombieland films, which I think are great, as well as Venom, which I had some fun with, but he has also done some pretty bad films in Gangster Squad and 30 Minutes or Less. His films always have a very clean look to them and a silly/fun tone. I was worried that tone wouldn't fit an Uncharted movie and I do feel that way after having seen the film as well. Bright and colourful (other than landscapes around them) is not how I ever saw an Uncharted movie looking, but again, it was adapted and I'm not going to complain about the look. What I feel is the weakest aspect of this film is the fact that there's absolutely no grit. Nobody is ever dirty, there's barely any blood, and it never feels like stakes are high because these characters can go through a lot without a scratch.Overall, I probably have more to critique than praise when talking about Uncharted, but that's just because the Screenplay felt like it was hitting random bullet points instead of fleshing out the world they're living in. It never felt lived-in. Still, I love the cast (including Antonio Banderas and Sophia Ali as well), the banter between Nathan and Sully was fun, the action is cool, and I left the theatre feeling positive enough about the film that I would love to see them continue. I will gladly go back for a sequel, but I just hope they evolve these characters more and get down to a grittier, dirtier story. Yes, the point of Uncharted is to have fun and tell a great story, but I felt the story was a little hollow here. I think it's a movie worth seeing and I recommend it because I think there is potential for so much better in the future. This film is just okay overall, but the groundwork has now been laid for something even better."
tt15325794,5.0,"Friend convinces friend to do something dangerous after a tragedy. Isn't this how THE DESCENT started? I think what kinda killed it for me was that I knew before I watched it that it was the same guy who made 47 Meters Down then as soon as we get to that scene and her friend starts acting differently I knew it was the exact same twist. I think the part that frustrates me about these movies is how you need to not apply logic. It can't be scary, because it's so stupid to go up that ladder with no plan b, not contacting someone about your climb, no one at the bottom in case of emergency. The list goes on. These are two stupid people who decided to do something incredibly. Stupid. So the tension is lost. It's no longer scary. It's pointless. So as a climber; this movie was technically wrong in almost all climbing aspects. And it all could have been fixed by asking a climber. Hell give them $100 for a consulting fee. To anyone thinking about making anything about a sport you don't know have extreme knowledge about; hire somebody in that sport. Don't make a skateboard movie without talking to skateboarders, don't make a football movie without talking to football players, and talk to climbers before you make a movie about climbing. The thing that I also find wrong with the movie is that they supposedly don't have cell-phone service when they're at max height but halfway down they have service! This is wrong because of the type of frequencies commonly used by cell-phones: VHF and UHF frequencies operate best at line of sight so the two girls really should have had even better cell-phone service at the height that they were at than at ground-level because they had no obstructions to the line-of-sight to a cell-phone network antenna! Oh well, I guess it's the movies which many times are not technically right!"
tt15325794,6.0,"Even with it's many flaws, it makes a viewers hands and feet sweat profusely. The great cover art tells you exactly what to expect.In my mind, the max that this kind of movie can attain is an 8/10. A movie where one is essentially stuck in one position for the majority of the film. The two that come to mind that did it best are '127 Hours' and 'The Shallows'.Abundant issues arise from the lack of simple preparation for such a complex stunt. And then pretty much just the normal stuff that makes you call characters dumb or annoying in a movie like this. And that phone apparently has an eternal battery.I had an early theory of taking out the red light so that it would be noticed and get replaced as soon as possible, but that didn't come to fruition. Thought it was a sure thing with what I believed to be a foreshadowing moment when they say it's there so planes don't hit the tower. Guess that would have been too easy.The movie is also a case and point why I don't like social media ""influencers""."
tt15325794,5.0,"Why wasn't THIS called ""Nope""???For at least the first 30-40 minutes, I kept asking myself: WHY DO THESE GIRLS DO THIS?!?! But, then I had to ask myself the same thing.See, I am DEATHLY afraid of heights, so I thought this might frighten me. I had NO IDEA this would terrify me. Of all the movies I've seen this October/Halloween season, I don't know yet which is the best. But I DO know which is the scariest.Have you seen Open Water, 47 Meters Down, The Shallows, The Descent, 12 Feet Deep or 2010's Frozen or any movie involving people stranded and the odds of being rescued is near zero? Then you've seen Fall.Fall opens predictably like Cliffhanger with a mountain climbing accident. A year later, the surviving duo from the cold open decide to climb a 2,000-foot TV Tower in the middle of desert. Going up wasn't 100% easy...but getting back down, near impossible.This movie is wildly predictable, unrealistic and the green screen definitely shows at times. But, for someone who has an enormous fear of heights, this was 100% effective. Heck, I originally regretted not seeing this on the big screen - no further. I was able to pause to take a breath from my pending heart attack.I sincerely doubt anyone else without my condition would be afraid or have patience for the melodrama and how these two barely took this situation seriously. The hook really is for the fear of falling. Or pretty ladies to look at. If you're into that sort of thing.This is one time I WANT there to be CGI and green screens. In no way possible should these two be filmed up an actual 2,000 ft tower.***Final Thoughts: I've been trying to get over my fear, but I cannot shake it. Last year I even purchased the ""Climb 2"" game for my virtual reality console. In it, you can climb mountains or skyscrapers. I hoped this would help. NOPE. I eventually had to stop playing that game as it was causing my heart to speed up every time."
tt3104988,5.0,It's a real puzzle as to why this film has had so many stellar reviews. There's a sickly amount of materialism and some fairly offensive caricatures of the people of Singapore I suspect. It does have a few funny moments along the way and Constance Wu just about keeps it alive but overall it's a pretty inconsequential film that doesn't match the hype.
tt3104988,6.0,"People seem to love or hate it. It is a simple plot with an awful lot of glitz. An attractive Chinese American woman falls for a handsome Chines man. After a while it is decided that she will meet his family. It turns out they are some of the richest people on earth. Of course, clashes with Asian tradition, mostly relating to family throw curves along the way. While it is interesting, it is pretty predictable and dull at times. What saves it is some information that comes in late that forces several issues."
tt3104988,6.0,"Not a bad movie, but you could have correctly written down 80% of the plot after the first 10 minutes. Points for some very good performances, absolutely stunning images of Singapore. Would have been fine to catch on TV than pay to see it in the theater."
tt3104988,6.0,"I was really expecting more. This felt like a Cinderella story of sorts even though it doesn't match the plot exactly. It still had a weird ""magic ending"" to it. Ironically full of 2 dimensional characters and villains. A Hollywood story in Asian clothes. Are we to understand that super rich cultures are the same all over the world? The greatest irony was the opening scene when the family is rejected in London as not being ""the right sort of people"" and then the family does the same to Rachel. Was that the point of this? wait was it a comedy?"
tt3104988,5.0,"Vapid, soulless and unfunny. It felt like I was watching a cheesy soap opera. Money, money, money is basically all this film offers. The story is uninteresting, the characters are weak and the writing is lame.Constance Wu and Michelle Yeoh are good, but it's a small conciliation.The fact that this movie appears on the 1001 movies list, among other recent additions in the last few years, renders the list to be a bit of a joke.

tt2316204,5.0,"""Alien: Covenant"" is a sci-fi action film technically perfect, with great special effects and landscapes. Unfortunately the story is terrible with the most unprepared (or stupid) crew ever seen. How could practically all the crew including the captain and the second in command land in an unknown planet without a better analyze of the soil and the atmosphere? They have a skilled android that should go alone and report whether the place is dangerous or not. One of the groups have a sick crew-member and his partner brings him bleeding to the only means of transportation they have to return to the spacecraft. The pilot risks the lives they are transporting and their colonization mission to try to rescue a few survivors. In addition, the performances are soulless and not engaging and the viewer does not care to the characters. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Alien: Covenant"""
tt2316204,6.0,"I don't know if I'm the only person to say this, but I think a horror movie works better if we see some intelligence in the script and in the characters' attitudes, and if the main antagonist is mysterious and able to surprise us. I liked ""Prometheus"", a film better than expected, albeit with a confusing script. This film establishes a clearer, more palpable link between that film and the ""Alien"" franchise. The script accompanies the ""Covenant"", a colony ship filled with people in hypersleep. The ship receives a mysterious signal from a planet that, by all indications, has excellent conditions for life, but quickly realizes that it has stumbled on a place where it should never have landed. After seeing the film, I had the feeling that we were looking at a very solid work that only lost when compared to the original franchise. Perhaps the best way to be fair is really to avoid this comparative exercise, which is seductive and almost impossible not to do.Shall we start with the good things? Very good! The film is a sight for sore eyes, especially for sci-fi fans and for those who like very visual films with high doses of special effects, CGI or extraordinarily detailed scenarios. There is no doubt that the budget had a generous slice set aside for computer technicians, art and costume designers and cinematography, and this investment has paid off handsomely. Everything is accompanied by an excellent soundtrack and good sound effects. And of course, there are lots of tense scenes. It is one of those films where the tension is permanent, but which never really scares us.Sadly, that's basically all this movie has to offer us. Fans of the Alien franchise will ensure that the film clarifies several gray points in the narrative of other films, such as ""Prometheus"", and I agree with this argument, but this does not seem to me to be something that we should overestimate, because it really was the least that could be done. Demanded from this film! At the script level, it is frankly disappointing: in addition to being lazy, making the most of what was done for the other films with which it is linked, it adds few new things. Yes, it creates some new creatures, ""cousins"" of the original xenomorph, but that's all. The human or semi-human characters are silly, devoid of development and seem to be waiting to be killed.The film starts out great, but becomes slow and tiresome as it becomes predictable. I have a high regard for Ridley Scott's work, I think he's a very skilled and credited director, but it's hard not to acknowledge that he failed here. The director was dazzled by the amount of CGI potential and neglected the narrative, editing and direction of the actors. Among the actors, Michael Fassbender stands out the most. The actor has given us one of his best works so far. Katherine Waterston also did a very good job. The rest of the cast doesn't have the time or material to do anything special."
tt2316204,5.0,"'Alien' is still to this day a tense, shocking suspenseful and frightening masterpiece, one of my favourites of the genre. The bigger and bolder 'Aliens' is one of those rare sequels that is every bit as good as its predecessor. Both are two of my favourite films and the character of Ripley is one of the most iconic female characters in film. 'Alien 3' and 'Resurrection' had their issues but to me weren't that bad, while 'Prometheus' had some fine elements while also some major flaws.My thoughts on 'Alien: Covenant' is fairly similar to my ones on 'Prometheus'. Not as bad as led to believe (having read reviews that were mostly mixed to negative), but could have been much better considering the brilliance of 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. With a good cast, and with the involvement of a hit and miss but talented (especially visually) director Ridley Scott, 'Alien: Covenant' could and should have been far better. Some undeniable strengths here, at the same 'Alien: Covenant' also commits the same faults as 'Prometheus', and makes even more of the mistake of having little point to it other than providing a few necessary answers to loose ends from 'Prometheus'.Lets start with 'Alien: Covenant's' strengths. Even when the writing and story weren't up to snuff, Scott's films always looked visually beautiful. 'Alien: Covenant' is not an exception. The settings look tremendous, of sheer beauty and with a real eeriness, the cinematography complements it perfectly and is often powerfully arresting and most of the special effects (apart from the disappointingly cheap-looking ones for the xenomorph) are a feast for the eye. Scott's direction has moments where it is superb, if more in the visuals and spectacle than the narrative.Jed Kurzel's music score is hauntingly unsettling and recalls one fondly of the music in the original film by Jerry Goldsmith. There are a few scary moments (though this doesn't come consistently) and credit is due for providing much needed answers to questions that were on people's lips after watching 'Prometheus'.Of a pretty good cast, considering what they had to work with, Michael Fassbender's commandingly and intensely acted dual role is the standout. Katherine Waterston brings steel and vulnerability, yet another performance demonstrating why she is one to watch, and surprisingly Danny McBride succeeds in trying to fully form his character rather than be annoying or looking stoned. Billy Crudup also tries his best with little to do.However, genuine tension and suspense is replaced by monster/alien action and attempts at character motivations. Sadly too much of the monster/alien action is not that exciting and only sporadically scary, cheapened by at times excessive and gratuitous gore (by far the goriest and bloodiest of the 'Alien' franchise and the approach felt a little out of place). On top of that the characters (in a film where there is too many of them in the first place) are very thinly sketched rather than fully formed and of the lot only Tennessee, Walter and David properly raise above forgettable, David especially being pretty splendidly drawn actually. The constant frustrating decision making from most of the characters also prevents one from properly connecting to them.Script is also often very weak, even more rambling and cliché ridden than that of 'Prometheus', with philosophising and thrown in references to the likes of Wagner and Michaelangelo that gives a sense that the film wasn't sure of its identity. The story suffers from dull pacing and from being over-stuffed of too many ideas not done enough with. By the time the big reveal came it leaves one with a so what feel, due to it being so obvious too early on, and there is far too much of a you have seen it all before vibe.In conclusion, tries hard and there's no doubting that a lot of work went into the visual aesthetics and the acting but 'Alien: Covenant' should have been much more. Certainly not awful but a disappointment. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
tt2316204,6.0,"The space ship and the alien world are portrayed beautifully in this movie. In that sense it's a beautiful movie. I wish Ridley would explore this further outside of the Aliens franchise.The ""aliens bursting out of the body"" theme -- the hallmark of this franchise, I suppose -- was done well in one spectacular scene. If you enjoy that kind of visceral, Cronenburg-esque horror, you won't be disappointed.Let me list the obvious problems....One problem is that the visuals are not that different from Prometheus. This movie is quite similar to Prometheus.A second problem is that there is no real intellectually interesting premise behind it all. No new story really. No character development at all this time, which is a huge problem. I don't like this special historical connection the aliens somehow have now with the human race via the Engineers. These Engineers. Who are they again?""Alien bursts out of body. Alien becomes scary and evil. Woman fights alien."" This is the plot of every movie. I'm tired of these aliens. A third, very annoying problem is that all the crew seem to be paired off with each other. This movie is proof that partnered people should not be in a military unit together, because if this movie is any indication, the minute one's partner is endangered or gets killed the screaming and blubbering and unprofessionalism begins. ""Oh my god, my wife might be in trouble, I will risk this huge space ship, and all 2000 colonists, just to save her. She's so important.""My response was: WTF is your wife/husband/partner doing on the ship with you if you're such an emotional mess? At one point, I yelled ""stop screaming"" aloud at the screen. This is why there are (or should be) rules about this kind of thing. Somehow the edginess of the marines in the first movie has morphed into this. I don't like it.A fourth problem, perhaps the most annoying problem of all, is that these people seem to have no understanding of the biological dangers of alien planets. I mean, a 10-year-old would know about this from watching cartoons. Why don't they? Why would you get so close to a man who was clearly suffering from some serious alien trauma? Why would you look into an alien pod knowing that the alien planet had somehow infected your mates? How can I rate a movie highly when I was spending much of it rolling my eyes?A fifth problem is that the David/Walter mix up was so frigging obvious. I saw it immediately. How could the crew not have checked this more carefully? It was just unbelievable that they didn't do this. And how did David learn Walter's codes? A sixth problem: the movie was confusing. I googled it afterwards to try to sort it out, but I still don't know how the alien got onto the colonist ship after all that effort to keep it out. I suppose David brought it in, but how? In his mouth? And what happened exactly when David brought the ship to this alien world. Where did he get those spores? What were they? Confusing."

George Clooney is pretty good, and he plays the smarmy role he is great at doing (the modern day Cary Grant). Nicole Kidman seems off, though. The role never seems to fit her, and there never seems to be a clear understanding of who she is: bumbling, nervous librarian? Or assertive world-class diplomat? Not surprisingly, the movie has sort of faded into obscurity, and will probably continue to do so as time goes on."

I could point out that the bad guy is a White European Christian but if I remember correctly the plot of THE SUM OF ALL FEARS was changed so instead of Arabs we had WASPish Neo Nazis as the bad guys . In fact I'm struggling to remember when the bad guys weren't whacko white guys , would it be GOLDFINGER by any chance ? I guess the movie deserves some credit in mentioning the motives of the villain who is misguided rather than evil , and the motives don't exactly put the United States in a very good light but of course it's left to an American special forces officer to save the day and yes there's a scene where the hero attempts to defuse a bomb that has a timer that helpfully lets the audience know how many seconds are left to detonation YAWN THE PEACEMAKER isn't a terrible movie . In it's favour it's much better than another Hollywood blockbuster dealing with the Balkans conflict namely BEHIND ENEMY LINES but is in no way comparable to something like SAVIOR . It's also infinitely inferior to a mainly forgotten British production called SEVEN DAYS TO NOON and it's a movie that is more interested in making money at the box office than giving people sleepless nights in a world where a stolen nuclear warhead might explode anywhere"
tt5034838,5.0,"We all know why we're here, don't we?Of course - we want mindless destruction with awesome monsters and great visuals, and if it was only about that, this film deserves some praise, indeed. I very much liked the wrestling component of the fights, with some of the highlight moves being some of the most satisfying examples that ever graced the screen.However, with all the monster madness there is something that most of these movies seem to get wrong almost every time: the overall plot and characters.Now, I certainly don't expect grand drama and acting excellence from a flick like this, but GODZILLA VS. KONG is a remarkably bad example for both of these aspects. All characters were pretty bad, and the plot... oh boy.Let me put it this way: when the movie is trying to be smart, it's pretty stupid. But when the movie is stupid, it's absolutely brainmeltingly stupid. The techno babble is annoyingly idiotic, down to a point where it completely took me out of the film, laughing hard at the audacity the writers had when typing these lines. The acting is at best alright, but Rebecca Hall's overacting and the astonishingly unlikeable attitude of Millie Bobby Brown's character ruined a lot of the already unbearably inept plot. Alexander Skarsgård's talent was pretty much wasted here, while all the others seem to come directly from that direct-to-video sequel to Roland Emmerich's Godzilla that never happened - for good reason.All in all, I can only recommend this film if you're able to leave your brain far, far behind and to focus only on the action itself. This is basically a script from 1997, made with today's technical possibilities - a script that probably even Roland Emmerich might have thought was too stupid.Also noteworthy: when the Tom Holkenborg score isn't the worst part of a movie, you know that something's off. Although, to be fair, this was actually a pretty decent score for our less talented Hans Zimmer clone.Don't believe the hype though. Instead, get drunk before starting to watch this, and you might have a good time."

And Kong controlling the land.Kong returns to the center of the Earth. But he needs human supervision.This is a movie for kids, and adults who can suspend disbelief.There is plenty of action and violence. No nudity or sex. Couple of curse words.I gave it a 10 for action and special effects. A 1 for plot. Halfway between 1 and 10 is my rating of 5."
tt5034838,5.0,"This is a mindless, plotless action flick with great action and effects but not much else. The plot is mundane, ridiculous and predictable. Much of it didn't even make any sense, because nothing is adequately explained. The acting is mostly awful. The editing made it difficult to follow what little plot there was. Actually the whole series of movies in this rebirth have all been really bad and this just continues that tradition. I am at a complete loss to explain the high ratings some people have given it and cannot recommend it all. Seriously don't bother with this."

Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) is a fan and she tracks him down with Josh. Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård) is a Hollow Earth expert. Oh yeah! There is the Hollow Earth, a magical axe, and a surprise villain.Honestly, I don't remember the previous movies. I don't know any of these characters. Non of them really matters anyways. I do like the idea of the little girl communicating with Kong. The movie should do more of that. BTH is a little fun as the conspiracy nut. His little Scooby gang has potential but it's not that great. The Hollow Earth is rather silly but whatever. It's stupid but kinda cool at the same time. The TRON ships are out of place. It's a tech mishmash. I don't really need a lot of the human story especially if it's not doing anything interesting.

tt5034838,6.0,"Oh, my was I disappointed with this one. I'm not sure what I want from a 'giant monster' movie, but this wasn't it - for the most part. I have a chequered past with the franchise. I hated the original 'Godzilla' as there wasn't enough of the monster (or Bryan Cranston) then the 'King of Monsters' sequel was little more than colours and noise before me, yet the - much maligned 'Kong: Skull Island' was quite an enjoyable romp.Here we have a film about humans. A lot of humans. Occasionally a giant ape or lizard show up and punch each other. That's about it. It's like 2007's 'Transformers' film all over again. I know that focusing a story on either giant monster would be difficult, so humans would have to be a major part of it - I don't know - it's just it felt too centred around pointless stuff. If the main cast of humans wasn't enough, they feel the need to include a totally redundant sub-plot about Millie Bobby Brown leading a pair of other wise-cracking, yet still bland, sidekicks around a secret facility. This whole aspect could have been left on the cutting room floor and the movie would be all the better for not seeing this - supposedly - secret base. Yes, this is the most secure facility that just allows any old Tom, Dick or Harry to simply wander in and nose around.And that's just one of the plot holes. I swear if a modern movie exists that has more leaps of faith in it than 'Godzilla vs Kong' then I haven't seen it yet. To even hope of enjoying this film you really can't afford to allow yourself to actually think too deeply about what you're watching, because nothing really holds up when put under any form of scrutiny.The humans are annoying, but the monsters are - reasonably - cool. Yeah, even for a big budget film like this they're still kind of CGI-looking, but they at least do more than their human counterparts. Naturally, our titular beasties have to team up to fight some 'greater evil' - if you've seen 'Batman vs Superman' it's almost a play for play re-enactment and I kept expecting it to be Doomsday. Don't worry - it's not just the - obviously evil - human baddie in this film who wears a coat over his shoulder just to prove what a cad he really is.It's a film. It's way too long. It's not terrible, but I got through it by not watching it at the cinema and therefore in the comfort of my living room I was able to fast-forward every time I saw Millie Bobby Brown come on."
tt0094889,5.0,"A classic Cruise film, where Cruise is still an actor more than the archetypal movie star. Cruise plays Brian Flanagan, a greedy youngster just back from the Army, eager to make big money fast in Manhattan. He cannot get a job in advertising or finance for lack of education and he ends up working in a fancy bar. I do not understand why savvy bartender Doug (Brown) would give the job to a guy who does not know how to make a cocktail, but this is one of those stupid plot devices one should not focus on.Doug and Brian make a dynamic bar-tending duo, very popular with customers, but their professional idyll is shattered by a femme fatale, for no other reason than to move the plot forward.Three years later we find Brian bar-tending in Jamaica, saving money to open his own bar, when Doug reappears with his rich bride. How and why Doug found Brian is another question better left unanswered. Brian is busy romancing Jordan, a ""poor"" artist who happens to be able to afford an exclusive cottage and extended Caribbean holidays (again, better left unanswered).Doug challenges Brian to seduce a rich woman to follow in his footsteps of kept man and cocky Brian obliges. Unfortunately Jordan sees him and is heartbroken. We're supposed to believe that a week of happy frolicking on the beach adds up to a great love story - or maybe they frolicked way longer, but again, how long was Jordan's holiday?The third act takes place in New York, where Jordan ran back and Brian followed with rich lover Bonnie. There the movie looses steam, heading to an extremely predictable ending.One good point of the plot is to show that people can enjoy a good life working a job they love. One bad point is that the cybernetic revolution taking place at the time is completing ignored as a source of wealth. The Brians of the time still followed the credo of ""greed is good"" of the finance world, while the real revolution took place elsewhereA great soundtrack adds a lot to the plot, which is pretty flawed and filled with holes. Nowadays, it is fashionable to revile the 80s as the decade of greed, shoulders pads and awful haircuts. However, those who lived through it, probably had fun and Cocktail is a classic summer movie, to be enjoyed without reflecting too much - even if only one third actually takes place in summery locations."
tt0094889,6.0,"Brian (Tom Cruise) is not a college graduate but heads to New York City to try and make his fortune. Although he is an aspiring business man, no firm will hire him without that big piece of paper. As he enrolls in night school, he takes a job as a bar tender. In a short while, he is one of the best bartenders in town. His girlfriend lets him down, however, and he takes a job in Jamaica. Once there, his reputation grows, as a great bartender and a supreme carouser. His world is shaken when he meets Jordan (Elizabeth Shue)....he just doesn't know it. When she goes back to New York City, he follows. Will happiness ensue? This film succeeds because of the attractions of Cruise and Shue, the lovely Jamaican scenery, and the romantic plot. Bryan Brown gives a very nice performance as the unlikeable bartender who trains Cruise. The costumes are nice, too, and the inside of Shue's New York apartment is quite intriguing as an artist's digs. If you love stories of unlikely romance and realized aspirations, this one you will like. All fans of Cruise and/or Shue, must take time to watch this film as well."
tt0094889,6.0,"""Cocktail"" was actually a pretty good movie. I didn't like Days of Thunder at all, so I was a little wary of another Tom Cruise movie. But then when I realized Elisabeth Shue was in it, everything seemed fine. So I watched it. And I couldn't stop watching it, even though I had to go to bed. Cruise is a young entrepreneur who can't get a job on Wall Street, so he ends up becoming a bartender. He meets Shue in Jamaica - roughly 45 minutes into the film. Over the course of 3 days, they fall in love with each other. (I never like this in movies, and this one is no exception). The plot seems like it's going to go in a romantic direction, but at least three sudden plot twists really keep you guessing where it will go next. Not one of Cruise's better acting moments (his poems are AWFUL and recited AWFULLY). Not as much Shue as you'd expect from her being the female lead. But all in all, worth your time if you're looking for a Cruise classic or a good 80s film. (Yet, if you're like me, it will leave you with mixed feelings about whether the protagonist is a morally upright Irishman or a lying, cheating illegitimate dog-child.) Recommended."
tt1028528,5.0,"As I sat down in 2023 to watch the 2007 movie ""Death Proof"", it was for the second time to watch it. I vaguely remembered it from back in 2007, so as I had the opportunity to watch it again, of course I did.Writer and director Quentin Tarantino wrote and director a fair enough movie here. It wasn't really among his best of movies, but it was watchable enough for the cheese that it was. Now, I am not saying that ""Death Proof"" is a bad movie, not at all. It is a watchable movie, however, it just wasn't all that outstanding.What made ""Death Proof"" a memorable movie was the cast ensemble, because there were some really good talents on the cast list here. With the likes of Kurt Russell, Zoë Bell, Rosario Dawson and Rose McGowan. And it was nice to see some of the actors from ""Planet Terror"" show up as well as the same characters, making the two movies take place in the same location and same fictive universe. That was a nice touch.Visually then ""Death Proof"" was good, especially the scene with the head on collision. There was so brutal imagery there, with great effects and a fair amount of mayhem and destruction.My rating of ""Death Proof"" lands on a five out of ten stars. The movie had potential, but there was just simply way too much footage of the ladies in the movie sitting around and talking."
tt1028528,6.0,"Only a Tarantino film can give you the feeling of pure boredom and electric intensity all at the same time. Both can come of simple conversation and over-the-top action. ""Death Proof"" is the quintessential Tarantino film, where he has long, drawn out conversations that are constantly interrupted yet free flowing and very natural as the characters talk about everyday things (pop culture) and use quirky old sayings. Tarantino is easily the greatest writer you could think of for pure dialogue and even though that's his greatest asset, it's also his biggest flaw. The film is cut into two halves and the first half is excellent. The ending is great (in both halves), but man, did that middle nearly put you to sleep or what?!?! It's not that it was incredibly boring material. The problem was: This was two similar movies smashed into one, with a ton of common parallels, Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), being the main figure. The second half doubles back on the first half; ultimately repeating itself. The women are powerful. They can control men because men are pigs and only think with their little heads as the women in charge tease them with their sexuality. Even though the girls aren't whores, they surely push the limits because when they don't put out, they'll get a guys respect- a common theme with both the first half and the second coming from eight different women who all think the same. The standout female performance came from Vanessa Ferlito (Arlene) who brought a certain flare to the screen that made the viewer care for her more than anyone else. She nailed this performance and carried the first half along with Russell. The dialogue (and there is a ton of it) is, as usual, captivating at the start. ""Death Proof"" is a faller, not a riser, but the action packed ending is strong enough to give this fair remarks. This is a common issue with Tarantino. ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" may have had the longest, most drawn out ending this side of ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" and the worst part is that we know exactly what's going to happen, because, like most Tarantino films, the women usually come out on top. The first half of the film is flawless. The conversation is perfect. The mysteriousness of Stuntman Mike- who has a thing for car crashes and testing the ""death proof"" slogan that goes along with his ""scary"" car- is great and the best part is that we never know where the movie is going to end (Or at least this story). Kurt Russell actually gave a very strong performance. His look was great and when he imitates John Wayne that should crack everyone up even if they don't know what John Wayne sounded like. The ending to the first half of the movie is great and the look of the picture is incredible as Tarantino pays homage to the 70s style look. You have random cutaways, intentionally poor editing where the conversation will skip, double back, and some parts will completely cut away (During a lap dance, too) at what feels like an inopportune time, but that's what makes it so great. The texture and overall look is dazzling right from the very first shot of one of the girls feet rockin' away- to a modernized Scorsese styled, catchy beat- on the dashboard against a light blue sky. Tarantino, stylistically, has a style all his own and this was great to see.The second half of the film brings in four more women that walk, talk, and act just like the four we seen in the first half. The film doubles back on itself and repeats the first half over again, just with different girls. The conversations are the same (all about sex), but there's one difference: ""these girls will fight back."" That will bring us to a wonderful stunt worked, high speed, well choreographed, and even better shot car chase that just doesn't want to end and I guess, in a way, that's okay. We deserve to indulge in a thrilling sequence for as long as it was after Tarantino toyed with our concentration and focus; dulling us with repetitive banter. Zoe Bell, the stunt women, had too many speaking parts. She's not a good actress where the first group of girls were much, much better and more engrossing. The last four girls weren't all that effective (Maybe because we seen it all before just minutes earlier). The final sequence will leave you laughing, not only because it's ridiculous, but how long it lasts and the camera work along with Russell' face is very funny. ""Death Proof"" was, for the most part, an enjoyable film, but this same old Tarantino song and dance is running on thin ice. Conversation, as always, in a Tarantino film is starting to take over more than ever for plot and the second half of ""Death Proof"" nearly ruins a nearly flawless first half. There's not much here in regards of plot and a lot of people are going to be getting sick of tired, pointless, going-no-where talk. It's time Tarantino reinvents himself."
tt15474916,6.0,"I think this film's getting a little more credit than it deserves. There's a sense in which the threat in it is a metaphor for PTSD, but there's also a very straightforward ""It Follows""/""The Ring"" rip-off going on, and these two elements directly clash. The film spends a lot of time on things that ultimately have no impact on the plot, so it goes into the climax having not really mapped out the nature of the threat. It's unclear what it is or what would defeat it, and elements of both ideas crash into each other resulting in a fairly incoherent conclusion that seems to suggest that childhood trauma is completely insurmountable.It's not a bad film. The horror sequences are mostly well-constructed and the atmosphere of creeping doubt is compelling. But, oddly enough, the central hook that the film is named for is one of those elements that is ultimately irrelevant."
tt15474916,5.0,"Smile is a new horror film directed and written by Parker Finn. After some short films, this is only his first real directing work.The film is about psychologist Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) who learns about a dark evil after a traumatic event with a new patient.This same evil continues to frighten and endanger her after this event. To stop this evil, she must learn its origins, but in doing so she is confronted with her own traumatic past.Film studio Paramount has tried to keep this film a bit of a secret and only promoted it with a hidden teaser on some films. Once the trailer hit the internet, it received a lot of positive attention. Because of this, the film studio decided to release the film in theaters, because at first the film would only be released on their streaming service. For example, they eventually had novice director Parker Finn direct this film and had it come up with a suitable story.For a first film, Parker Finn manages to portray the film beautifully and appropriately. He knows how to create creative transitions between some scenes. The images can only come across as somewhat familiar to horror fans, because many scenes come across in similar ways to scenes from other films, especially well-known horror films.Despite Parker Finn's good work, Paramount could have arranged for some extra people to give him some extra support. The story of the film is good, but not really original. Horror connoisseurs can quickly compare the story with stories from other horror films such as The Ring of It Follows. For example, the film can at times become a bit predictable for horror connoisseurs, who can then roughly predict what will happen in the film and thus anticipate the story itself.Parker Finn knows how to create a good tension with the way in which he manages to portray things together with an appropriate soundtrack and further frightening sounds. Unfortunately, this often only leads to a simple jump scare. After the umpteenth time, this can start to seem faint rather than being really scary. This allows the film to lose its tension level a bit.Parker Finn does try to bring out some other horror ways during the end of the film, but these are no longer as strong or frightening. If he had been more creative earlier in the movie with different horror elements, the movie could have been better and scarier. Around the end, he also seems to lose some of his focus, so that all of a sudden everything happens and seems to be possible.Despite the fact that Sosie Baconmeer is known as a TV actress, she knows how to deliver good and appropriate acting in this film. She comes across as someone who continues to be plagued by evil and must try to relive her traumatic past. She knows how to carry the film well, because the rest of the film cast is also more actors from TV series or small film roles. Most of them play their roles well, but with most of their characters it is possible to predict what will happen to them."
tt15474916,6.0,"""Smile"" is a film that has a spectacular art direction, its interior and exterior locations are well achieved, from looking calm to being gloomy. The performances are good, highlighting those of Sosie Bacon and Kyle Gallner. The problem is in its script that is not entirely original, we have a mix between the story of ""The Ring"" together with ""It Follows"" and even elements of the lousy movie ""Truth or Dare"", the result is nice but it doesn't come furthermore, some scenes are drawn out and become predictable, the story's formula of a curse being passed from one person to another is losing its charm. A good movie but without more pretensions than entertaining."
tt15474916,6.0,"Do you remember the movie ""It Follows""? Smile reminds me a lot about that movie. The plot is very similar, something is passed on from one victim to another. The creepiness and terror are also very much alike. It's pretty terrifying, even though it doesn't use that many jump scares. Unlike other horror movies which primarily relying on jump scares to get the audiences hooked. The plot is rather predictable, I could already guess the ending halfway through the movie. But even then, I didn't get bored. It must be the way the director made the movie engaging. The only reason I didn't give it 7 stars is because I hate unsettled endings. I like horror movies where the protagonist survives and defeats the source of problem. That's the only reason I gave it 6 stars."
tt15474916,5.0,"This movie just gave me hell of a ride the whole time. All I can say is Amazing . It was suspenseful, thrilling. Like Rose, I was kind of digging too. I was eager to know what's happening around her. Was it just her hallucinations or real? She is also a therapist, so seeing her getting through this makes me wonder how she is going to deal with this.Though it looked like hallucination at first but it doesn't seem to be hallucination at last. Then what's this? Around 20 people have gone through same situation and the pattern they followed is same too. So,what's really going on?Is really a curse which is passing from person to person??It was really good but ending is juat unsatisfactory to me. I really wanted to know how it all starts. But,it ends without any answer."

Its transmit when there is a trauma and to get rid of it we need to kill someone else. So yeah thats pretty it. I mean at the end, the monster was very well made and have a scary face and proportions. But except that its only jumpscares, dreams, music who play a dissonnant rythm and thats all. We have all the cliché here: a woman lose her job because she is possessed by something since the young lady killed herself in front of her. And we have the separation from her sister, husband and even her psy. The jumpscares are there but the story was pretty simple and to know more about the possession trough the other cases is good but clearly not enough to hide all the classic parts of an horror movie. I did like the sound design and it really give the tension when its needed but beside that its classic and not so interesting honestly. Good if you dont have other horror movies to see in the moment."

tt10696896,6.0,"Matt Damon is excellent and thoroughly convincing as Bill, an unpolished roughneck from Stillwater, Oklahoma. Essentially, this is a fish out of water story, when he finds himself on a prolonged stay in Marseille in southern France, trying to prove his daughter innocent of the murder of her girlfriend. This, right here, is the movie's weakest link: Abigail Breslin is completely unsympathetic as the daughter Allison. When you should be rooting for our hero to succeed in his mission, you really don't care one little bit whether she rots in prison or not. Conversely, Bill's relationship with local woman Virginie and her adorable daughter Maya is when this movie is at its best. Their Franco-American culture clashes also provide all of the humour. I also liked how no effort whatsoever was made to show either Marseille or Stillwater in a good light. Both are portrayed as gritty, shabby and uninviting. Sadly, for all it's promise and tension, the ending feels rushed and unsatisfying."

He's respectful to everybody, has two guns, and prays before every meal. Money is tight. He was a bad absentee father but he travels to Marseille, France to visit his daughter Allison (Abigail Breslin) who is in prison for murdering her girlfriend. She claims to be innocent. Bill has a suspect but no one is willing to help. He befriends a young girl named Maya and her mother Virginie (Camille Cottin) helps him as his translator.First, the elephant in the room is the complaint by Amanda Knox. She's entitled to her feelings and I'm sure that it feels bad to have other people take advantage of her story. While this story has some similarities, there are big differences from her story. In addition, this is the father's story more than the daughter's story. Amanda may feel exploited but at best, she is the starting inspiration for the writing of this story.The most compelling aspect is to make this MAGAian character as a sympathetic lead. The world is grinding him down but he still struggles on. He is Sisyphus. Their mantra becomes Life is Brutal. For the movie's first 2/3, his struggling to save his daughter is very compelling. His friendship with Maya is very sweet. The better way to wrap this up would be a sweet tragic turn with Maya. The turn it actually does is too convenient, too setup by the movie, and the movie had moved on. It clashes but I'm willing to live with it until the further twist comes. The twist is a real problem and it retroactively destroys some of the movie's first 2/3. Breslin would be acting differently and her explanation is a little light. It screws up an otherwise great movie."
tt0250797,5.0,"Unfaithful (2002): Dir: Adrian Lyne / Cast: Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Oliver Martinez, Erik Per Sullivan, Michelle Monaghan: Painful yet well crafted film regarding unfaithfulness. Richard Gere and Diane Lane play a married couple whose marriage is threatened when she has an affair with a bookseller played by Oliver Martinez. Predictable and dark especially when murder factors. Even a visit from the police seems recycled and obvious. Adrian Lyne's films often address sexual consequence but the sex scenes seem more as a peep show. Better examples of his work are Indecent Proposal and 9 ½ Weeks but this is not one of his better films thanks to its emphasis on being a peep show. In the first the sexual tension is high but not shown. In the second it is displayed in multiple variety to back its subject matter. Here it just seems like an excuse to place two actors in hot sexual action. Gere and Lane deliver on frustration and guilt despite being props for a dim cliffhanger. Martinez is charming and seductive and ultimately too abrupt. Other roles play for convenience over purpose. As with most Lyne films, this one is well made in terms of locations and lighting but its message might have worked more effectively had the affair been less of a peep show and more about motives and consequence. As a result it is more about steamy sex than the consequences of infidelity. Score: 5 ½ / 10"

One could argue that Lyne's track record damns him from the start, linking him as it does more than a little with the likes of Zalman King, for whom adultery is just a way of spicing up some soft core sex.  `Unfaithful' is not without merit  Richard Gere as Edward Sumner allows himself to step down from supercilious glamour to be a bit of a loser, a man not sexy to his wife; Diane Lane's performance as that wife, Connie, who falls under the spell of Paul Martel, Olivier Martinez's good natured, but stereotypical version of a young SoHo-dwelling Euro-hunk, is energetic and committed and the public has loved it.  But what in Chabrol's film was bright, hard and gripping in the manner of Hitchcock and Highsmith becomes, in Lyne's hands, a messed-up woman's picture, full of fantasy, guilt, unresolved emotion and unresolved action. To begin with  and this beginning weighs down the movie --the affair between Connie and Paul is so glamorous, sexy, reckless and hot that it appears to be an end in itself and the husband's subsequent revenge seems like quite another  way too long  movie.  Lyne's mixed messages are signaled by the fact that the mise-en-scene, the whole look of the movie, is far too glitzy and unreal throughout `Unfaithful,' starting with the dreadfully overdone windstorm that throws Connie and Paul into each other's arms on Mercer Street.  	And Lyne doesn't know how to end the warped version of Chabrol's story he has created.  He hates for Gere's character to get punished for his revenge (aren't Edward and Connie close again once Paul's out of the way?  Wasn't their marriage really fine all along?), but, well, murder is a Bad Bad Thing; so after suggesting any number of endings, `Unfaithful' stops with the final outcome all up in the air.  And the bumbling around, the groping for a suitable finale, makes the movie's final half hour seem interminable.	All of `Unfaithful's' flaws can be traced to its departures from Chabrol's classic:  why tinker with a masterpiece?  Chabrol's tweaking of French bourgeois smugness and boredom is lost because Lyne's movie isn't willing to show the suburban marriage as anything but smooth and glossy  perfect, really.  They've got a lovely house, nice lives, a cute, engagingly quirky and outspoken nine-year-old son (Erik Per Sullivan of `Malcolm in the Middle' makes a bit of a Shakespearean child).  After the husband (Gere) half-accidentally gets rid of the lover, the couple is reunited in guilt and angst:  it's so mushy.  Chabrol's couple found their sex lives greatly improved.  Lyne's movie isn't that cool.  Lyne's lover is so glamorized, such an older woman's fantasy, that the movie loses track of his main function in the original story:  in Chabrol's film, the lover was basically just a huge problem. Lyne makes him a super-turn on, and then just a huge source of guilt.  There's no resolution.	True, Diane Lane nearly saves the picture at times, because her slightly worn beauty  she's a little frayed, but still very attractive, and, as her women friends say, she's still got the same ass she had in college  makes us want her to go out and have fun.  And when the fun is too intense and too guilt-ridden, as in the great sequence where we see Lane in the commuter train after the first sex session, her face taking us through all the emotions of adulterous passion, intercut with glimpses of Paul's creative love-making  for that moment we're carried away.  Unfortunately, though, Chabrol's movie was about something else, which the lover and the adultery only led up to.  Lyne's `Unfaithful' sticks close to Chabrol's plot till the end, but it constantly seems to want to be something quite different, something more like Brigitte Rouen's 1997 `After Sex' (`Post Coitum Animal Triste'), which is more embarrassing but also more real (there's no revenge, just a big come-down when the younger man moves on, and a tough effort at reconciliation).  `After Sex' is about the wife's folly.  But Chabrol's plot, which Lyne is closely following, is about the cuckolded husband's anger, how it can both revive and wreck a marriage.  `Unfaithful' is pulled in two totally different directions, sex fantasy and revenge thriller, and it comes apart, while we check our watches. (`Une Femme Infidele' was far more gripping, and half an hour shorter.)"
tt0250797,5.0,"This is a movie about being unfaithful. you probably guessed that. The unfaithful person is one Connie Sumner (Diane Lane), wife to Edward (Richard Gere). Edward is actually a nice guy, and a loving father to their child Frank (`Malcolm in the Middle' star Erik Par Sullivan). Nonetheless Connie is not content with her somewhat staid home life. One day - caught in a Storm of Foreshadowing! - she is thrown into the life of a Frenchman Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez). He is much younger than her and gradually tempts her into getting with them. Connie must decide whether she can live with this secret affair, or will her misdeeds strike back!! Dum dum DA!The first half of the movie is interesting. It's principally played from Connie's point-of-view. Diane Lane is quite excellent here - she's neither the selfish wife and yet she does not overplay the guilt role. She's never quite comfortable in her extra-marital affair but this is conveyed in nice subtle ways - Paul and her are ever only about sex for example (there's no real conversation between them). The whole thing is just a means of escapism - there's no real love there and Lane lets us clearly see this. She portrays passion well, but also the other emotions such as love and, on some level, sadness at being where she is. The minutiae of her performance are what make this movie worth seeing.Unfortunately the acting abilities of the rest of the cast are nothing special. Martinez gets by on merely looking good and saying suggestive things in silky tones. His character - mostly just a catalyst for Connie and Edward - is incredibly one dimensional, not helped by the forgettable performance. Gere is OK, even when he does get centre stage in the movie. His performances tend to fairly sedate - whether this is him purposely playing a (mostly) controlled character, or a lack of acting ability is not for me to say here. He's a nice guy, who has his suspicions about his wife's change, and reacts in a bog-standard movie way (quite disappointing in some senses). Their kid is just cute and while his lines do actually sound like that of an eight year olds, he's still just blandly `cute kid #1035'.Adrian Lyne, the director here, is back at his usual forte of adult relationship thrillers. It's all pretty good - some nice symbolic touches (ohh look a shot of a kettle on a hot stove as Connie wincingly dabs her cut!), and an ending that's agreeably ambiguous (and well shot). The pacing here is generally pretty good (the use of two main characters helping), although that can't help the disappointing nature of the second half of the movie. Still `Unfaithful' is above average for it's type, mostly due to Lane. Catch it on TV sometime as it does not requite a big screen. 6.3/10."
tt0250797,5.0,"I wonder where did Mr. Lyne and Mr. Sargent live. Are they confusing Chicago, the Windy City, with Manhattan? Sorry, but as a native of this city, I've never seen anything like the wind storm at the beginning of the film. It's a very silly premise to throw the 2 would-be-lovers together. At any rate, can anyone tell me what was Connie Sumner doing in Soho buying party things that she would have been able to get (much cheaper too) at the nearest mall? It just doesn't make sense, as well as the rest of the film.Could I also ask whose idea was to cast that young actor Erik Per Sullivan as Charlie? I mean, give us a break, Mr. Lyne, with such nice looking father as Mr. Gere and a gorgeous mother, Ms. Lane, you would have expected the kid to be as photogenic and a great presence on screen, instead, we keep wondering: Is this kid adopted?In order to make the story a little more realistic, Mr. Lyne should have insisted in keeping Richard Gere's hair without the help of Clairol or whatever they dyed his hair with, because then, the film would have made sense as we all would have told ourselves, well Edward can't satisfy Connie and that's why she goes into the affair. We are not given any indication of what's wrong with their marriage since all appears to be honky-dory on the surface.The cliche of having a French lover has probably been used too much already and Paul Martel, the Olivier Martinez character can provide a lot of kinky sex and raise Connie's libido. Poor Edward, he can't cut the mustard at home, so Connie must go to Soho to satisfy her desires, oh la la...Don't ge me wrong, the film is nice to look at. It's a mixture of Architecture Digest with a Pottery Barn catalogue. Wouldn't have been better to re-decorate than getting involved with Paul Martel?.The ending is a cop out. Sorry Mr. Lyne, but are you telling us that crime does pay? Obviously Connie thinks that life could be a beach at the end of the murder!Heaven help us from another collaboration between Lyne and Sargent. Amen"
tt0250797,6.0,"From the tag-line, I expected this movie to be about a secret, lusty affair and a jealous, raging husband who takes things too far. The secret, lusty affair part is right, but, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting in terms of storyline. Which isn't' to say the story itself is bad, it's not, but the execution of it was hard to take seriously at times.First off, usually with these adultery movies, we at least understand why the adulterer wants to cheat. I found that the exposition into Connie's life was not adequate enough for me to feel sorry for, or at the least understand her. She lives in a quiet suburb, she has been ""happily"" married for 11 years, she has an 8 year old son, who is cute, but somewhat annoying, as boys that age can be, her house is in a state of disarray because of this, and she seems to spend her days... doing... not much. She goes into town one day (wearing heels and a tight fitting dress... to shop for ""auction items?"") and randomly falls into a *gasp* sexy French man. She scrapes her knee in the tumble and the sexy French man invites her in to clean up. Cue sexual tension. Turns out, the French man makes his living as a bookseller and offers to give her a book of poetry about getting ""drunk off Life"", and inside the book he has snuck his phone # in it, for her to discover while she opens the book one day at home. Of course, being the foolish woman she is, she decides to call him, and things escalate from there...Now I won't reveal any more details, but at times it is just hard to take Diane Lane's character seriously. I won't disagree that her acting is amazing, but just the way the character is written and her actions is just extremely frustrating. At times, she is a guilty housewife, a lustful adulterer, and a terrible liar. The only character who I truly feel for and believe is fully developed and genuine is the husband, who displays an honest and believable reaction to finding out about the affair (let's face it, obviously he will find out, who are we kidding)...But, honestly, this movie had the potential for a higher rating from me... it just needed better execution overall."
tt5108870,6.0,"""Morbius"" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch Dr. Michael Morbius, a biochemist trying to find the cure behind an extremely rare blood disease. He infects himself and he is completely changed by it.I have to admit that I do not understand the reason behind the low rating of this movie. I am not saying that it's a masterpiece and it does not have any flaws but it does not also worth that low rating. I can understand that it's small duration didn't help the main character to evolve and I believe that there was not enough time for the end of it. The interpretations of both Jared Leto who played as Dr. Michael Morbius and Matt Smith who played as Milo were good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""Morbius"" is a nice, entertaining action movie and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it and I advise you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed."
tt5108870,6.0,"Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.My Rating: 6.3/10."
tt5108870,6.0,"6/10 - I don't know what all the fuss is about with this one when the quality matches that of either Venom movie and while I didn't love the visual design of the vampires, I thought the cinematography, VFX, sound design, and Adria Arjona (who is now on my ""Actors to Watch"" list) really elevated the relatively weak story."
tt5108870,5.0,"Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble.While at first it seems to be a radical success, a darkness inside him is unleashed.Will Morbius succumb to his mysterious new urges.....You know when a studio knows that a film may be in trouble, when they plaster the Marvel name everywhere on the poster, just in case nobody knows who Möbius is. And this film is a lot of trouble.It's nowhere near as bad as a lot of reviewers have said, but its the same as saying a hammer to the foot is better than the hand. It's clunky, unfunny, and worse of all, boring.Leto looks so uninterested with his character, and lacks the oomph that Möbius needs. Yes, whilst he is in vampire form, it's undeniably pretty cool to look at, but its all CGI and only took a green screen and Leto wearing a few ping pong balls. So Leto is a major problem, he's a good actor, and has been in some fascinating films, but this is him just phoning it in.The rest of the cast are okay, Smith is really chewing the scenery with his Milo, and whereas in other films he would grate like Ruby Rhod, he brings some much needed life to the film when he's ever in it.The nods to the MCU are so in your face, that it makes you wonder if the studio thought the audience would forget it's in the MCU. There is a daily bugle, and then the end credit sequences that are only there just to reiterate to the audience that they are watching another MCU film.The boat is named the Murnau a nod to Nosferatu, Möbius uses his lab like a gym, a reference to The fly. This just makes you want to watch those films, because they are infinitely better.And if the slow motion was taken out of this film, it would only be fifteen minutes long, there is that much in this film.It's too dark to be camp, too self-absorbed to be funny, and this is what the film desperately needs.It's one of those films that you will go back to again and again, just for the 'what the' factor.It's not the poorest comic book movie ever made, the remake of Fantastic Four holds that crown, but it's on a par with Superman 4 and Batman & Robin, rubbish, but for some reason you can't help but watch it every once in a while."
tt8002382,5.0,"I was really looking forward to this, purely based off on vibes. I didn't have any prior knowledge about it. The lighting's off; it looked like there was a filter on the entire time. Personally, I would have preferred it to have a more natural look because the filter didn't really enhance anything. I just started watching 'Siren' and Gil Birmingham plays a cop there too, which was a very similar role, identical really.The story here is pretty intriguing, though it has no mystery element making it feel predictable. From the title alone, I thought it'd be similar to 'Where the Crawdads Sing,' but the similarity only lies in the setting. It reminds me somewhat of 'Stockholm, Pennsylvania' (2015) with Saoirse Ronan, although I find the story better here, but not the movie itself. It begins similarly, with a girl who was kidnapped, but her father never hurt or abused her, so she's distraught when he's portrayed as a monster. Difference is here we time jump decades later, Her past still affects her as she now has her own family and life and stuff.The movie, in my opinion, is average; nothing exceptional, making it quite forgettable. I wasn't too invested in the characters. It's a slow-paced psychological thriller, not too emotionally intense, and the high points didn't quite hit their mark. The third act was probably always going to be challenging to execute. I couldn't think of a more natural ending for the story so it didn't bother me too much. I think it was intentionally kept simple and straightforward, because it had the potential to be much darker and more intricate."
tt8002382,6.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. Karen Dionne's 2017 bestselling novel is the source of this film from director Neil Burger (THE ILLUSIONIST, 2006), and it has been adapted for the screen by co-writers Elle Smith and Mark L Smith (THE REVENANT, 2015). Having not read the book, I am unable to offer a comparison, however, it's probable that the film moves at a faster pace and that the book fills in much detail that the two-hour runtime is forced to skip over. Typically, neither of this would result in an improvement, yet the performances are strong enough to generate enough tension and suspense to satisfy most viewers (if not the book's fans).Opening with some very cool shots through the marshlands, the story takes us deep in the forest as a father (Ben Mendelsohn) teaches survival skills to his 10-year-old daughter, Helena, played by Brooklynn Prince who was so memorable in THE FLORIDA PROJECT (2017). One of the lessons ends with the father proclaiming, ""You must always protect your family."" Sure, it's about as obvious as foreshadowing can get. There is a level of creepiness to the off-the-grid cabin living of Jacob, his daughter Helena, and Helena's mother (Caren Pistorius, SLOW WEST), and once we realize the situation, it leaves us wishing we had experienced a bit more of the misery and fear that will ultimately determine the future of these three people (plus some others).We then flash forward twenty or so years, and find a grown-up Helena (Daisy Ridley) married to Stephen (Garrett Hedlund, MUDBOUND) living a comfortable suburban life as they raise their young daughter Marigold (Joey Carson). Helena has chosen not to tell Stephen her past, and that secret comes crashing down when her father Jacob (known as The Marsh King) escapes from jail and comes looking for her. Father and daughter reunite as the old cabin in the woods, and things go a bit bonkers; however, that earlier foreshadowing comes into play, and Helena finds herself utilizing those early daddy lessons against that same daddy.Daisy Ridley has the physicality required to pull off this role and her resemblance to young Brooklynn Prince is uncanny. Mendelsohn is, as always, a menacing presence using subtle movements and that remarkable voice. A supporting nod goes to Gil Birmingham (HELL OR HIGH WATER, 2016) for a key role as well. At its best, the film (and I assume the book as well) captures the sometimes remarkable contrast between childhood perspective and that of a grownup. We can only hope that for most folks, it's not similar to that of Helena.Opening in theaters on November 3, 2023."
tt8002382,6.0,"I was quite lucky I didn't read the IMDb synopsis for 'The Marsh King's Daughter' before seeing it, because it would've completely ruined the film's opening - and the opening is the strongest thing this film has going for it.From there the film falls into ""perfectly fine"" land. Everything is passable and it's a mildly entertaining way to pass 110 minutes. But there's nothing daring or original or memorable here sadly.The film also relies heavily on characters making nonsensical decisions that only make sense as a method to drive the plot forward. You either get used to that in this film or you're unlikely to have a good time.As I mentioned, if you go in with a positive attitude and you're not looking for perfection you might just have a reasonably good time with this film. Even if you do however, I doubt you'll think about it again a week after seeing it. 6/10."

Gil Birmingham lends decent support, but this one is only just passable."
tt8002382,5.0,"Predictable from fade-in to fade out, ""The Marsh King's Daughter"" benefits strictly from the sterling performances of its gifted cast as well as the sprawling beauty of its Canadian scenery. ""Illusionist"" helmer Neil Burger directed this straightforward, by-the-numbers yarn based pm Karen Dionne's bestselling 2017 novel of the same name. ""Revenant"" scenarist Mark L. Smith and his daughter Elle Smith penned the screenplay. Suspense is singularly lacking in this psychological thriller. Cast as our heroine Helena, Daisy Ridley of ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" is the adult daughter of a rugged outdoorsman, the eponymous Marsh King (Ben Mendelson of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story""), who raised her as a tomboy so she could not only live in the wilderness but also live off the land. He teaches her how to shoot a rifle and how to track wild game by the impression that the animal makes on the ground. Jacob teaches young Helena (Brooklynn Prince of ""Cocaine Bear"") everything she needs to know about being a skilled hunter. First and foremost, he indoctrinates in young Helena the necessity to protect her family. Ultimately, this proves to be Jacob's undoing. Unfortunately, Helena's seemingly bucolic lifestyle is marred by the evil circumstances surrounding her mom's predicament. Initially, Jacob abducted Helena's mom, Beth (Caren Pistorius of ""Slow West""), and he took her against her will deep into the woods far from civilization as she knew it. He forced her to live in a remote spot where she couldn't escape. During her captivity, Jacob and Beth had a child Helena, and their little girl lives in blissful ignorance about her background.Eventually, everything changes for better and worse when a guy on a four-wheeler who is lost in the woods cruises up to their cabin searching for directions. Without a qualm, Jacob shoots and kills him. Later, the authorities, primarily Sheriff Clark Bekkum (Gil Birmingham of ""Wind River""), rescues Helena and her mom and arrests Jacob. Many years later, Helena winds up marrying a handsome college professor, Stephen (Garrett Hedlund of ""TRON: Legacy""), and they have a daughter, Marigold (newcomer Joey Carson), and are living happily ever after in their own home. After Clark rescued Beth, he wound up marrying her. One day, Helena learns his estranged father has escaped from prison while being transferred in a prison van. Later, the authorities discover Jacob's body in the flaming wreckage of a stolen vehicle. They make a positive identification because the corpse had some of Jacob's teeth. However, Helena suspects Jacob is not dead, despite the assurances of the FBI and the local enforcement who are satisfied entirely that Jacob has bought the farm. Meantime, Helena has revealed to Stephen nothing about her checkered past life as well as her murderous father, so Stephen is caught off completely guard and stunned by the news that an escaped convict is none other than Helena's diabolical dad.Acting on her gut feelings, Helena plunges into the woods and eventually confronts her father in the wilderness near their old stomping grounds. Helena's delusional dad wants Helena and Marigold to accompany him to Canada where they can grow old together as a family. Naturally, Helena wants no part of this proposition. When Clark comes looking for Helena, Jacob guns him down. Earlier, Jacob had wounded Helena in the leg and held her at gunpoint. Earlier, our heroine has recovered her old lever-action rifle from the cabin where she grew up and followed Jacob. She shoots at him and his canoe overturns. When she goes to investigate the capsized canoe, Jacob surprises her and takes her hostage. Since his canoe is ruined, Jacob forces his wounded daughter to take him to the canoe that she used to enter the marsh. Cleverly, Helena outwits Jacob and she ends up shooting him in the head. Had this been a lame horror story, Helena would have wounded rather than killed him. Happily, she puts Jacob out of her misery. Altogether, ""The Marsh King's Daughter"" amounts to little more than an average, boilerplate thriller that springs few surprises and lacks spontaneity."

It seemed like these things were going to connect into the story and why the Beatles music isn't present but they just left it there and he kind of says ""oh well"" and nothing comes of it. The second was he finds out there are two others that also know the Beatles music and again seems like this should be a big part of the story to tie things together as to a bit of ""why"" but they just have a conversation about it she gives him an address and then that's it. His conversation with what I think is supposed to be John Lennon didn't make sense either. Does that mean the other 4 exist? Did they never meet to make music? Just all added up to a great idea that worked early in the film but didn't follow through properly. All my opinion of course"
tt8079248,6.0,"The original premise of the movie was fantastic - only one man knows that The Beatles ever existed and brings their music to the world.It could have been really really great. Unfortunately the idea was under developed, it felt as if the film's makers weren't quite sure what to do with it.It ended up being ""nice"" and ""sweet"" when it could have been brilliant."
tt8079248,6.0,"To cut a long story short, with a film directed by Danny Boyle and based on a legendary band such as The Beatles, I was expecting significantly better, although the movie is definitely not bad. The love story between Jack Malik and Ellie Appleton is excellently interpreted by Himesh Patel and the gorgeous Lily James, while Kate McKinnon vervely interprets a sickening impresario. But the movie is globally disappointing with a certain flatness and a script suffering from a blatant lack of originality: the « Twilight Zone » effect has been seen again and again so many times. In fact, by being slightly in bad faith, the film Yesterday (2019) can almost be reduced to the Beatles songs. I am fully aware of the exaggeration, but allow me to moan and groan: I'm slightly disappointed with such a banal rom com about The Beatles, a stuff of legend across all periods of time."
tt8079248,5.0,"Great idea, great actors, but the script could be better. Instead of making it a fun and adventurous movie, we ended up with exaggerated sweet romantic soap opera situation, that made me want to turn it off."
tt8079248,6.0,"A film full of The Beatles songs cannot really go wrong.Danny Boyle has made a whimsical fantasy. What if we live in a world where The Beatles did not happen. John, Paul, George and Ringo never amounted to much because they never got together.Gosh it would mean somebody else narrated those early episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine.Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a struggling singer in a small seaside town who is going nowhere. About to call it quits the only person who believed in him is best friend from school, Ellie (Lily James.)One night when all the lights go out throughout the world, Jack is involved in a bus accident and wakes up in a world where no one have heard of the pop group The Beatles or their songs.Jack writes the songs from memory and wows the audience with Hey Jude, Back in the USSR, Here Comes the Sun, Yesterday and Let it Be. These songs find an audience for the first time.Unfortunately Richard Curtis's screenplay takes some interesting ideas and then diverts its attention to a soppy and unnecessary romance.This is a rom-com. Jack and Ellie have only ever had a platonic relationship so far. All through childhood, to those teenage years when their hormones were raging to the present day.Jack it seems has never had a girlfriend and has never romanced Ellie, the woman who has always believed in him. Suddenly Jack realises he needs Ellie when she has found someone else.I would like to have known more about this world that had no Coca Cola, cigarettes and Oasis. The joke about Oasis was funny, a band so influenced by The Beatles, they could never exist if the Fab Four had never happened.Then again without The Beatles there would had been no Bruce Springsteen, The Eagles and Brian Wilson would not have strived so hard to create Pet Sounds. Some young filmmaker called Robert Zemeckis would never had made a movie called 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand.'It does raise another issue, The Beatles were more than just the songwriting. It was also the music, the harmonies, how they sang and the production by George Martin.Some ideas are explored such as the music industry sanitising the product they want to sell. The White Album has diversity issues according to a marketing executive. However Curtis goes for the default romance story in the second half which lets it down."
tt1879030,6.0,"Its hard to make a drama erotic, the more complex if its the other way around. Q is an erotica at its dramatic best, a distant topper in the genre. The plot evolves with lives of some characters revolving around Cecile, the protagonist in the drama, and how she change their lives. Too much subtle the screenplay at times, that we tend to lose it quite easily. And thankfully, the erotic scenes never shadows the feel of the movie which makes it engaging throughout.The creditable performances from the cast imprints the quality of the drama, and quite deceitfully we get obsessed with the protagonist played by the gorgeous Déborah Révy - a rare breed of voluptuousness and acting prowess. The movie for all its sensuousness should be indebted to some unseen good locale, complemented well by good cinematography. A must stop port this for the erotica lovers, and a good watch for other movie goers. Its an erotica at its dramatic best. 6.5/10"
tt1879030,6.0,"This movie is very daring because showing many unsimulated sex scenes, what is not frequent in mainstream movies. Some young actors are good and promising. The first one is Deborah Révy who plays the leading role. Even if her character is not very credible (a girl obsessed by sex and greedy to make love with many people, just because her father died recently), she plays it well, with a provocative and natural attitude. She's pretty convincing even if the storyboard is rather awkward.Hélène Zimmer who plays, on the opposite, a shy girl frightened to make love with her boyfriend for the first time, is touching and very convincing too.In that kind of movie showing explicitly physical love, I preferred ""9 songs"" by far, because in ""Q"", one has often the feeling that the explicit sex scenes are shown for themselves and don't really serve the story. so, watching the movie, one have an embarrassing feeling to be a voyeur.that's pity, it could have been far better. But I enjoyed it anyway."
tt1879030,6.0,"Wow, other reviewers see this as pornography. Take another look. It's about connection and disconnection in French society, in which sex and discussions about sex are used as a central vehicle for showing relations between men and women in French society (or at least younger ones). Note that the director never shows anything above the waist of the nude women in the shower chattering away about sex and men. Note that all the characters are missing each other needs and hence at odds and frustrated. Note the scene in the plaza where everyone is self-absorbed. Note that the author starts the movie with a message that he still believes love is possible. Where the movie fails most is not in its failure to do more than vaguely allude to the background situation - unemployment and a shipyard strike. Why those are even there is never clarified. Rather, it was the director's inability to bring the story to completion without implanting an implausibly happy ending that left me wondering what was the point of it all. If French social relations are pretty much the same as they were 25 years ago, then the director's gotten quite a bit right. Unfortunately, he didn't know where to go with it. That's why, in spite of the good acting (for the most part), I gave it only six stars."
tt1879030,6.0,"I love this film! It is honest and beautiful, and I actually liked how all the sexy scenes never stopped surprising you. Very sincere and I also love the storyline. There is nothing about this movie that feels fake, and yes, maybe it was not what I expected but it was... fascinating. It also contains some great acting. More films out there should be this honest and real! And also, I like Cecile's and Chance's relationship, it is just so interesting... You can really see from the beginning how they care for each other, and yet they do not make any promises or expect anything from each other.The shooting and conversations in the movie is what I feel makes it so honest. Absolutely wonderful.I would totally watch it again. And again."
tt1879030,5.0,Good movie to watch for especially the love connection the movie is not bad at all it speaks in moving love.
tt1879030,6.0,"I viewed the Strand Releasing version, which was stated to have toned down the sex scenes. Their version is still a pretty strong R film with plenty of nudity. There are intermittent B&W nude scenes set in a shower where they are frankly discussing men and their desires. The film is about young people in France, during a time of strikes and unemployment, so they are mainly jobless and aimless, at times destructive and obsessed with lust. The men talk primarily about getting ""it"", and the women want more then a simple coupling, and also seem to understand the power they have over the men when they withhold themselves. The passionate scenes between them seemed to have feelings that simple porn movies never have. I really liked the one scene where the mother was concerned about what her daughter might be doing with her boyfriend, and the father then assures his daughter that he and her mother also played around. There is an error with one of the women, when she says she needs her glasses to see, and then for the rest of the film is not wearing glasses (she was told she looked better without glasses.) Movie with subtitles."
tt1879030,6.0,"The opening was controversial. Erotic without being pornographic, music is briliantlly chosen and incorporated, but the story and acting.. bad. Too much soap opera to be viewed as realistic today."
tt1879030,5.0,"Even though it is a French film, it's quite good. Beautiful scenery, quaint little French café's, beautiful countryside. HOWEVER, the movie takes a twist and turn and the explicit sex scenes are what we would see in a pornographic movie. They don't really add much to the context of the story but, for some, and especially the main character, will excite. I was mortified and shocked when I was given a ticket to preview a special screening, sitting their with my grandmother who lived in France for many years, I thought it would be nice for her to see France again. She saw a bit too much of France! I really don't know what to say about this film which has been branded 'Art', apart from : watch it, and make your own mind up. So ...um... yeah...(Normally my comments are more in-depth and detailed but I'm at a loss for words with this one.)"
tt0369610,6.0,"As a huge fan of the original JURASSIC PARK - I was twelve years old when I saw it in 1993, pretty much the perfect age - I was eager to check out this all-new and revamped sequel/update/reboot of the premise. At the same time, I pretty much dismissed memories of the previous two sequels, which were entirely forgettable and sub-par popcorn flicks. The new JURASSIC WORLD is one heck of a mixed bag as a film. It contains many, many flaws and parts I hated, alongside some good moments that I enjoyed. It's very similar to the new TERMINATOR GENISYS in that respect, although an improvement over the Schwarzenegger movie. The good parts of JURASSIC WORLD are invariably those which involve the dinosaurs; when the dinos are on screen, the film is fun; when they're off, it's a failure.The main problem lies in the writing of the human characters. It took four scriptwriters to concoct this mess, and what we get IS nothing more than a mess. There are gender stereotypes and a clichéd romance straight out of a 1970s-era Mills & Boon novel. There are annoying kids throughout, one of whom is mildly creepy, the other a crying little brat. Vincent D'onofrio and Irrfan Khan are the best of the human cast, as their natural charisma comes through, but Bryce Dallas Howard is hopeless, the worst I've ever seen her. Attempts at characterisation and to make her character funny fall flat every time and as for her stilted acting...well, I was cringing. This film has a real problem with the female characters and the kids and even a good actress couldn't have done much with this character, which puts the women's liberation movement back some 50 years.The human plots are poor and sloppily put together. The first half of the film has scale but no sense of the intricacies of running a theme park, then all of that gets forgotten about in the second in favour of a small-scale human drama. Vincent D'Onofrio is likeable but attempts to turn his character into a bad guy (when he clearly isn't) are pitiful. Plus, I hated the way we finally get to see a populated theme park with thousands of visitors, only for them to remain off screen and irrelevant for most of the time, aside from in a 5 minute set-piece, then they're forgotten about.So, that's all the bad stuff. The good news is that the dinosaurs are great and great fun to watch. CGI effects have improved to the point when they look quite nice, particularly the underwater dinosaur. The Indominus rex is a fitting menace, although the real stars of the show are the Velociraptors, who have a sub-plot (i.e. they're tame) which could have been the cheesiest thing ever, but which turns out to be the best thing in the movie. The monster action at the climax of this movie is strong stuff indeed and it makes for far better spectacle than the recent GODZILLA remake. So, there you have JURASSIC WORLD: a mix of the great, the awful, and the generally humdrum, but it provides a fitfully entertaining thrill-ride if you do your best to ignore the pitifully written characters. NB. I also checked out the 3D edition, which adds plenty of immersive depth albeit few 'jump out' shots."
tt0369610,6.0,"I only got around to watch the fourth installment in the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise about a year after it was released upon the world. Why? Well, after a steadily sloping series of movies, then I wasn't in any particular hurry to get around to watch the most recent of the movies, it being ""Jurassic World"".And now having seen it, I must admit that this was visually a beautiful movie. As was the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie back in 1993 when it was first released. And it did offer some adequate entertainment, for sure. But everything here had essentially been presented to the audience throughout the course of the three previous movies. Sure there was the thing with the Indominus Rex creation that stood out. But wasn't it just a twist on the gene manipulation and reproduction that essentially sparked the first dinosaur in the first movie?The acting in the movie was good, although you should not expect any great thespian or Shakespearian moments throughout the course of the movie. People did adequate jobs with what they had to work with from a fairly limiting script and storyline.The CGI is what carried this movie, as it has been with the entire series since the first movie. And the dinosaurs are quite life-like and realistic to look at - taking into consideration that we only got fossils to compare appearances with.The movie does bear some sarcastic permeation of American consumerism, in terms of everything has to be bigger and better. And look how it turned out in the first, second and third movie. So it makes you wonder why they still haven't learned their lesson and continued on with a new dinosaur amusement park.While ""Jurassic World"" is certainly an entertaining movie and a visual treat for the eyes, then it is hardly a revolutionary movie, nor is it a movie that really were particularly necessary to the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise."
tt0369610,6.0,"This is a film for families, like all Jurassic movies so far, so they have to use a pseudo-family unit as the main character. They also have to tell you how to feel at every moment with blunt soundtrack bits that leave nothing to the imagination. The evil corporation, the arrogant rich man, the uncaring secretary and the opportunist need all be punished for their sins. Not so the sexy redhead who got everybody killed in the first place or the annoying children who do whatever they feel like it while a killer dino is on the loose . God, not the children!This sums up the plot of the film. There is absolutely no recipe for a quick buck that was not used in the movie and the rest, which is just as formulaic, is just special effects and a weird hybrid (see what I did there?) between Jurassic Park and Godzilla. Say what you will about Spielberg, the man knew subtlety.Points for not killing the black person first. They went with the Asian."
tt0097737,6.0,"The first half of ""Leviathan"" is competently made and surprisingly absorbing, with strongly drawn characters and good acting all around. In the second half, the film degenerates into an ""Alien"" rip-off (and later on, it even steals a classic scene from ""Jaws""), with derivative special effects and too many familiar elements. But it is saved (and gets 6/10) by Cosmatos' professionalism; he certainly redeems himself here for making the absolutely terrible ""Cobra"" three years earlier."
tt0097737,6.0,"However, that is not to say that it isn't entertaining, because it is. The film is about a group of undersea miners who discover a Soviet wreck. The wreck contains a potion that of course, one of the crew members has to drink. The potion turns out to be a formula that turns people into reptile like monsters that will eventually spread their symptoms to everybody else on board.We have seen this all before. The Thing, the Alien series, The Deep, etc all have one idea or another that were thrown into this film. You have got the creature that takes over people's bodies(Alien, The Thing), the blood supply being depleted by the creature(The Thing), the remainder of the crew trying to escape the ship in a limited amount of time before it self destructs(Alien), and the scene where all of the guys are sitting around eating, talking about sex and other things(Alien).This movie could have been a lot better if they had thrown something original into it. Why not use more comic relief? That may have spiced up the film a bit. However, the film is not that bad and if you cannot find anymore decent sci-fi horror films to view, this one may just be up your alley."
tt0097737,6.0,"An interesting case for sci-fi fans and a missed opportunity for the director, having a generally decent cast, a sufficient budget and a story, let's say 'not overused enough for that time'. The totally obvious Alien rip-off is technically surprisingly well executed and pleases with almost top notch set designs and very good creature effects. Now that all this didn't make an absolutely satisfying, or actually even really good sci-fi movie can be blamed on the lack of tight pacing in the script, occasionally bad editing or I guess generally the rather inconsistent lead of George P. Cosmatos, resulting uncalled-for moments of amateur filmmaking entering into a movie otherwise to be taken serious. These then start accumulating and gradually getting out of control as the movie gains speed (among others resulting conversations on the subjects of popcorn and puzzles) and then ultimately explode into a 5 minute orgy of total C-Movie crap, actually even added after the anyways forgettable climax of the movie (how the hell did that happen by the way?). Otherwise, we can say, that the first 2/3rd of the movie is pretty okay, not counting a few minor downers and then gradually messes up in the finale. In the end you decide weather it was worth watching or not. Though for genre fans I guess this is absolutely obligatory."
tt0097737,5.0,"A deep sea mining team discover a sunken ship and they bring back some cargo from it- but after bringing it aboard one by one the crew becomes contaminated from some strange under-water organism.This film is nothing but an 'Alien', 'The Thing' and you can kind of add 'the Abyss' hybrid, ripping off the plot of 'alien' and the special effects and monster design from the 'the thing'- but this time its not set in space or on ice but actually under water. It was not the only under-water feature film to come out that year but also 'the abyss' and 'deepstar six' with it sharing more common ground with the latter.I'm not really a fan of under-water features; 'The Abyss' was pretentiously over blown and dull, 'Sphere' *Yawn*, 'The Deep' was sleep inducing and 'DeepStar Six' was *hmm* fair- but still irritable. Well though this was an under-water film and basically a rip-off of two great films, it actually isn't that bad- because of a pretty good cast involving Peter Weller, Ernie Hudson, Daniel Stern, Richard Crenna and Amanda Pays and the wonderfully realistic special effects truly pack a wallop and a pretty bizarre- but decent monster design from Stan Winston.It does have a very slow opening- but the characters themselves make up for it, though they might be cliché ridden, like the joker, cool headed leader, mischievousness doctor, token smart-ass black guy, the edgy and unstable guy, the young go-getter and the strong willed female- but at least they were likable and compelling and that's because of some good performances and a witty script, than that of the similar monster film 'DeepStar six'.The slow first half makes way for an adrenaline pack second half where the tensity mounts, there are some tense and very claustrophobic scenes that keep you on edge- but overall the film mostly lacks surprise and does become predictable, especially if you've seen 'Alien' and 'The Thing'.The monster itself looked quite astonishing... especially the change it goes through is truly mesmerising, even more then the finish product and a detail explanation of the monster's origin is a welcome change. The score is definitely one of the standouts by Jerry Goldsmith (who also did 'Alien'), who captures the alienation of the sea and the tension of the edgy situation that occurs. While the cinematography of the under-water mining base and the ocean floor is fairly eye-catching, as the look and setting of the film is vibrantly rich and engaging in detail.This film can only be appreciated as nothing more than an unoriginal- but amusing rip-off. I for one enjoyed it for what it was.3/5"
tt0128853,6.0,"You've Got Mail represents the tail end of the golden era of romantic comedies, during which writers and directors were trying to get an angle that would work for a more cynical movie-going public. Nora Ephron, with her rapier wit which she often hid within a cinematographic soft glove, was one of the more successful filmmakers of the later period. This film is a remake of The Shop Around the Corner from an earlier rom com era, so there are layers to the references in this movie, and if you catch them all, some of them are quite ironic. Especially the unintended ones, though. The script updates the story of the big retailer putting the small retailer out of business even as the two proprietors fall in love by recasting the retail stores as bookstores (this was actually a very big deal in the 90s) and the pen pals are corresponding via email rather than snail mail this time around. Looking at this film all these years later, you can't help but marvel at the fact that the filmmakers had written a romance about a big box bookseller winning the girl by utilizing a tool that was destined to put him out of business one day. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan both have a great deal of personal charm individually and solid chemistry together, so the movie works on that level. Some aspects of the film aged less well than others. For example, the opening scenes that show Hanks and Ryan seeing their lovers off to start their days, and then sneaking back to their laptops to emote at each other via email, are played as cute hijinks, when today their actions would be recognized as an emotional affair. It's immediately clear that neither one is involved with a suitable lover, and then those lovers very conveniently (and somewhat ironically) develop a connection with each other, but still. This movie is somewhat of a time capsule, and still worth a watch with that in mind. Hanks and Ryan do a better job of selling the idea that these two can overcome his rampant trampling on her livelihood through their personal connection to each other much more successfully than the script manages to do."
tt30215084,6.0,"This is Me Now is Jennifer Lopez's latest album and the continuation of her 2002 album This Is Me Then which was dedicated to Ben Affleck.This 60 minute feature is a collection of all her new songs directed by Dave Meyers (who also did Beauty and the Beast by Ariana Grande ft John Legend, Havana by Camila Cabello,No Tears Left To Cry by Ariana Grande and Let Somebody Go by Coldplay ft Selena Gomez). Each music video is connected to Jennifet Lopez from jumping into relationships,to getting into rebound love(as she has a song called Rebound which is obviously poking fun of Alex Rodriguez I assume),to finding herself(This Is Me Now).There is also a hummingbird which reflects on life,and Jennifer has a song called Hummingbird and Flowers and Rainbows.Overall it was a lovey doupy extravaganza all about her love for Ben Affleck. I really hope these two would last as this feature will be just a misunderstood concept on love.This documentary also features familiar faces from Sofia Vergara,Kim Petras,Trevor Noah,Jane Fonda(who worked with J Lo in the 2005 film Monster In Law),Jay Shetty,Keke Palmer and Post Malone who all play zodiac constellations. Ben Affleck is also in this feature with heavy prosthetics as Rex Stone and we also see side profiles of him too on a motorbike and near the end of the film with a rose stuck on his shirt.Even Jennifer Lopez's former collab Fat Joe features as her therapist and Derek Hough as one of her husband's.Visually stunning but the acting is bad.4/10 acting
10/10 visuals."
tt30215084,5.0,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. I like Jennifer Lopez as both a singer and actress, so when I saw this pop up, I was intrigued. The impression that the trailer gave was kind of a satire; Jennifer laughing at her unlucky-in-love past, so to speak.Let me get this out of the way first and foremost: the movie has promise and I loved that it didn't take itself too seriously!With that out of the way, the movie was incohesive. The movie was visually appealing, but the overly-produced music video segments take away from the movie and make it seem too try hard, in my opinion. Either have a cohesive movie, or a compilation of music videos!I had originally given this movie a 3/10 rating, but once I got passed the movie's faults, I able to enjoy it for what it was and found that there were funny bits (I liked the scenes with the zodiac signs and her friends). Therefore, I upped the rating to 5/10."
tt0795421,5.0,"Armed with irresistible hooks, soaring melodies and near-celestial vocal stylings, the Swedish pop group ABBA churned out a body of insanely catchy and superbly crafted tunes - ""Waterloo,"" ""SOS,"" ""Fernando,"" ""Dancing Queen,"" ""The Winner Takes it All,"" etc. - that made it the world's top-selling musical act of the 1970's and early 1980's. Several decades later, ABBA's music became the basis for a hit stage musical entitled ""Mamma Mia!"" in which a simple narrative was deftly woven around many of the quartet's songs. Now, the much-ballyhooed movie version of ""Mamma Mia!,"" written by Catherine Johnson and directed by Phyllida Lloyd, has arrived on the scene.The story takes place on a beautiful Greek island where the never-married Donna (Meryl Streep) single-handedly runs a modest hotel for an ever-thinning crowd of tourists. Her daughter, Sophie (the charming Amanda Seyfried), has never known who her real father is, mainly because Donna herself doesn't even know. With the help of her mother's diary from twenty years ago, Sophie narrows the candidates down to three (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard), then secretly invites them to her wedding in the hope that she will be able to figure out which of them is her real father in time to have him accompany her down the aisle.On stage, ""Mamma Mia!"" succeeded primarily because it was able to keep its wafer-thin storyline modest in scale and life-sized in scope. But blown up to the magnified proportions of the big screen, the material becomes a compendium of overacting (Julie Walters being the most egregious culprit in that regard), ham-handed literalization, forced spontaneity, and production values that look both gaudy and chintzy at one and the same time. Moreover, the direction is clunky, the choreography abysmal (especially compared to what we were treated to in ""Hairspray"" just a year ago), the photography either over or underexposed (depending on whether the scene is set at night or during the day), and the singing not unlike what one might hear emanating from the local pub on an average karaoke-night.In fact, there has always been an inherent problem built into ""Mamma Mia!,"" which is that much of ABBA's charm derives from the crystalline voices of its lead singers, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Faltskog. Take away those harmonies and at least a certain percentage of that charm is lost. Now the movie version of ""Mamma Mia!"" comes along and simply compounds the problem by hiring big-name actors rather than trained singers to somehow interpret the pieces for us. Indeed, this must be the only musical in movie history made up almost entirely of people who can't sing (at least in the old days they used to dub the voices in if they had to). One has to give Streep brownie points for at least trying to belt out the tunes, but her rendition of ""The Winner Takes it All,"" which was the rafter-rattling showstopper in the stage version, falls flat due not only to her own inadequacies as a vocalist but to the awkward staging and foolish hand gestures she uses to accompany her singing (almost as if she were trying to act out the lyrics as she's singing them). Actually, I've never understood why anyone would buy either the original cast recording or the soundtrack to ""Mamma Mia!"" anyway when the real thing is readily available and clearly far superior to any imitation.All that being said, I am still inclined to at least half-heartedly recommend that people go to see this movie for a number of reasons. First, because the music itself (written by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus) is fun, infectious and finally irresistible, no matter how much the singers may be unintentionally stomping all over it; second, because even though their singing leaves much to be desired, Streep, Bosnan and Seyfried somehow make us care about the characters and the silly little predicament they're caught up in; and third, because there are a number of scenes that actually work quite nicely, the best being when Donna sings the sweet mother's lament ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" (a song clearly within Streep's limited vocal range) to her soon-to-be-wed daughter. Streep and Seyfried are both very moving and poignant not only in that particular scene but in all of the scenes in which they appear together.For the half dozen or so audience members who aren't already familiar with the ABBA oeuvre, one can only hope that they will use ""Mamma Mia!"" as a springboard to sampling the real deal."
tt0795421,5.0,"Taking the music of Abba and telling a story that has nothing to do with Abba or Sweden or the 70s/80s and casting Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnon seems like a crazy idea....and it is....but there is a fine line between insanity and genius.The plot is, Sophie is about to get married. But she doesn't know who her father is. She invites the 3 men who could be her father to the Greek island where her mother has a hotel and the wedding will be held.People, sing, dance and well things get confusing and emotional.The music is ABBA, you know you like it, even if you won't admit it.The acting is good. The thought of Meryl Streep dancing and lip syncing to ABBA might make people shudder, but this is her genius. She is emoting to every lyric and few people could pull it off.In fact the cast is generally superb.Pierce Brosnon manages to miss the point of the movie. He only accepted the role (script unread) for a chance to work with Meryl Streep. It is not actually a matter of bad acting, but it just some how doesn't work.Something different and it if you like it, it will be your little secret."
tt0795421,6.0,"Let me tell you. Just because I've been listening to ABBA almost non-stop since I saw MAMMA MIA! two days ago does not mean I enjoyed the film all that much. It's just the Swedish pop super group's music is so darn infectious. You would think that energy would translate to feel-great good time at the movies but sadly this is not the case. First time feature filmmaker, Phyllida Lloyd, spends far too much time dragging her feet when they should be dancing up and down the beach and no matter how many shots of the moonlight shimmering against the waves there are, the film is still a clunker instead of a stunner.When a musical is paper thin on the stage, it runs the risk of being just plain silly on the screen. On the stage, MAMMA MIA! is a somewhat justified excuse to revive a bunch of ABBA tracks wrapped into a completely implausible, overly romantic farce. Young Sophie (played on screen by Amanda Seyfried) is but 20 and about to marry the very supportive and very handsome, Sky (Dominic Cooper). Something is missing though. Sophie has lived on this tiny Greek island her entire life and helped run a crumbling hotel with her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) but she has never met her father. As far as she knows, he left before her mother could say anything to him but a chance encounter with her mother's diary from the summer of her conception narrows the possible men to three. So rather than talk to her mother about her desire to know where she came from, she invites all three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) to her wedding, pretending to be her mother looking for a reunion. Naturally all three men accept the invite and hijinks ensue. While the campiness of the whole affair is forgiven on stage because the suspension of disbelief doesn't apply, this screen version is too far removed from the stage to feel the least bit plausible.I believe in angels, something good in everything I see. And while there is very little good to focus on in MAMMA MIA!, at least there is always surprising Streep. She jumps up and down on beds, slides down banisters without the least bit of concern for breaking her hip. She can sing too. Much like she did in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, Streep's performance as the lonely mother of the bride carries the film forward and, in the show stopping ""The Winner Takes It All"", elevates the film to heights it could never have achieved without her participation. Though the two don't get nearly enough screen time together, Streep and Seyfriend make a great mother/daughter combo. Seyfried's fresh exuberance seems like it might actually be inherited from her movie mom. The rest of the cast delivers varying results  Julie Walters clearly thinks she is a comic genius but she comes off too brash; Christine Baranski is miscast as an older bombshell making for some particularly awkward moments with younger men; and someone should ensure that Pierce Brosnan never sings on screen again.Ultimately, MAMMA MIA! never connects all of its components. A melodramatic moment is followed by a peppy ABBA song, which somehow erases everyone's pain. In that sense, ABBA's music is the perfect choice to set the tone as it is some of the most depressing pop lyricism set to upbeat melodies in pop history. While the contrast adds weight to the songs themselves, the musical masking casts an air of falseness that never lifts. What your left with is a compilation of poorly choreographed, plainly sung music videos. No offence, Meryl, but you are long past your MTV days."
tt15771916,5.0,"If you like Julia Louis-Dreyfus or Tobias Menzies, you may find this enjoyable to watch, as both do a fine job with their roles. Otherwise, this will seem like a slow way to spend a couple hours. The plot wanders around searching for a dramatic climax or a storyline that leads somewhere. However, it doesn't get anywhere in particular. It's much like a comedy routine that just wanders from one story to another. Not too surprising, as Julia Louis-Dreyfus helped make ""Seinfeld"" the somewhat chaotic program it was. Funny, often, but as a movie, it leaves me wanting a more structured story.A better title would have helped too. Something more like, ""How we offend people when trying to be supportive"" would have been illustrative, albeit not as pithy. The one theme that did seem to be reinforced was scenery of New York, especially as experienced by privileged people. That was interesting for about 30 minutes, but then the movie needed to deliver more message, if it had hopes of being satisfying. I rate it a 5 for the fine acting of the leading characters, but no higher for lacking a better script and story development. The result looked like it needed refining to clearly communicate a message."
tt15771916,5.0,"Definitively mediocre and proud of it. So much so that the characters justify to each-other regularly how disappointed they are with their own art. All of the actors really felt engrained into their roles and the sincerity here was refreshing, although the talent wasted. A charming and chuckle worthy movie, for sure, but not memorable in the slightest.I'm starting to get tired of these upper-class ""late-coming-of-age"" films about characters experiencing ever so slight growth or pressure. Half of the characters are bored themselves. I've met just about all of these characters in real life and they're barely more interesting in-person.The stories in the movie are satisfied with being simply relatable, while the protagonists-- very realistically-- argue and quibble about their interpersonal issues that they spent most of their lives doing little about. And yes, it's very realistic, but this film begs to be more. Notable because the film spends a good amount of time poking fun at overly precious writers and the ironic lines drawn between Fiction and Creative Non-fiction, doesn't that seem off for a movie this creatively devoid?This is a film about writers and written by a writer, literally a few jokes about Screenplays. Shouldn't that lead us to expect a less rote adventure? Maybe I'm weird for expecting comedies and characters to be exciting, unpredictable, and unique, but it felt like the writer and actors were suppressing their power-levels here. Any random episode about the Sopranos has more to say about this movie's themes than it did."
tt1790809,6.0,"The best film in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise will always be the first, which is still a terrific film fourteen years later (has it really been that long, feels like only yesterday when first seeing it when it first came out).Its sequels are not on the same level, and while they are a long way from flawless none of them are awful films either. They have their flaws, 'Dead Man's Chest' did get too frenetic sometimes, 'At World's End' was overlong, bloated and needlessly bloated and 'On Stranger Tides' (which has been dumped upon by many here but to me it was a very enjoyable film, one of the better sequels, and much better than given credit for, which is not going to be a popular opinion) had an underdeveloped and forced romantic subplot and too much filler that could have been trimmed in some places. They all have great merits, namely great visuals, exciting action, Hans Zimmer's music, Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Bill Nighy.'Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge' has its defenders but has also been met with underwhelmed disappointment by critics and most fans. Personally am on the fence with 'Salazar's Revenge' and consider it one of the weaker entries generally of the series, with only 'At World's End' being weaker. It is a decent and fun enough ride, but it could have been so much more and has some glaring flaws.It is easy to say forget the story, however this is a strong case of being very hard to do so when there is so little to it. It takes a while to get going and there are some real pacing problems in the final act, which has its good points but generally is very tedious. It is very thin for the running time and feels overstretched and bloated, giving the impression the film is too long. The script has some droll and witty quips every now and again, but mostly it is very weak with far too much of a rambling, improvisatory and random feel, it just doesn't feel that well structured. There is also a very bizarre exchange with Depp and Paul McCartney (whose presence is rather jarring).Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are vastly inferior to Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, they lack presence and come over as bland and dare one say deadweight. The music score is rousing enough and creates some nostalgia, but can be overly bombastic and is too much of a retread from the music of the previous films. There is an overload of CGI effects, which standard-wise are mostly splendid though with some artificial ones too.With all this being said, there are obvious merits here. Once again, the production values are impeccable, the cinematography is skillful and full of beauty and atmosphere, the costumes, sets and period recreation is authentic and sumptuous and the effects are superb. As aforementioned the special effects are splendid quality-wise.'Salazar's Revenge's' action is a lot of fun too, being coherent and exciting, especially the very scary one with the undead shark and the ending, which also does a good job clearing up loose ends. There are some great and suitably light-hearted comedy set pieces, like Jack being dragged by a building and clinging onto the guillotine.Jack not being the central focus but still being essential to the plot proved to be a good move. 'Salazar's Revenge' succeeds in bringing a sense of nostalgia. Loved Barbossa's story arc, inarguably the film's most interesting which allows Geoffrey Rush to really sink his teeth and give a fun and moving performance. His revelation and his farewell was heart-breaking in its emotion.Contrary to what some have said, apart from the newcomers to the franchise Thwaites and Scodelario as well as McCartney, the acting was fine. Although Johnny Depp's performance has been criticised, to me he still has the enthusiasm, sense of fun and swagger. Geoffrey Rush does a great job as always, while an unrecognisable Javier Bardem (very impressively made-up) is simply brilliant and clearly having a whale of a time as perhaps the franchise's most sinister villain (if not the best, that title still belongs to Bill Nighy's Davy Jones).Summing up, decent and fun enough ride that could have been so much more. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
tt1790809,6.0,"At some point, the sorceries are only limited by imagination. They don't seem to take source anywhere sensical. Fun ride nevertheless. Depp can pay his debts."
tt1790809,6.0,"The Pirates franchise has been a bit of a doozy since it's shocking box office success way back in 2003. Curse of the Black Pearl was never meant to house a sequel, as it was an open-and-shut swashbuckler flick that was heavy on energy, action, humor, and blockbuster soul. It garnished tons of Oscar nominations (and money), upped Johnny Depp's persona several notches, and helped give Disney the box office crown in 2003. 14 years later we see the fifth installment, with the second consecutive attempt at creating a new Will/Elizabeth love story, the second consecutive attempt to replace the underrated director of the original trilogy Gore Verbinski, and once again taking the crown as arguably the most expensive film shoot in cinematic history.Production hell doesn't begin to describe the attempts to create the fifth movie, even though On Stranger Tides was met with very poor reviews. Johnny Depp refused the original idea, which would have featured a female villain for the first time. Johnny Depp was going through a nasty divorce and got injured, delaying the shoot even longer. Disney and Bruckheimer were arguing about costs, and the script itself (which is a disaster we can describe later) was undergoing changes and multiple hands. And I'll still never understand how the writer of Rush Hour 3, Speed 2, and Tower Heist managed to get his hands on such a big film. Oh Hollywood The only company willing to cling on to a sinking ship of a film is Disney, simply because their patience constantly gets rewarded, and it's impossible to discontinue a franchise that has earned them a nasty 3.8 billion within only four films. So after epic struggling for many years, we finally see Dead Men Tell No Tales gracing the screen.Not going to lie, this film is an entertaining mess, and part of the wave of recent sequels/prequels that went through similar production issues which affected the final product. Alien: Covenant went through tons of trouble, and then we see Fate of the Furious have to find a way to edit out the obvious tension between Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel. But the Pirates franchise is more than just a cluster of movies, its part of the Disney fandom culture, it has a life of its own through video games, books, and mysteries and intrigue surrounding it all. So copying, abandoning and contradicting plot elements of the original trilogy gives this movie a layer of frustration we didn't need, and we definitely don't deserve after such a long wait. Even after the entertaining first half, it all gets damaged by the unmet potential and by the awkward familiarity of the plot. And this comes from the Disney Company, a film studio notorious for being vigorously detailed with all of its IPs, from Marvel to (especially) Star Wars.Another curse that doesn't allow the cursed to touch land? Sounds familiar. Woman who doesn't believe in the oceanic supernatural mumbo-jumbo? Sounds familiar. A person who denounces pirates suddenly becomes one? Also sounds familiar. British navy trying to conquer the seas from the pirates? Heh, okay. The entire plot line felt very similar to Curse of the Black Pearl, yet this installment felt like it was tapping the brakes far too much. This watered down and clownish Jack Sparrow didn't perform any swordplay once, he didn't trick anyone a single time, I don't think he even delivered any clever quips of any kind. The villain didn't have a final showdown against Jack, as we witness a CGI-laden chase as our climax, a far cry from the dizzying mayhem during the big showdown in Dead Man's Chest. Worst of all, we didn't get the dramatic showdown between the enemy ships and the Flying Dutchman, the ship that you know, controls the damn seas, and has a captain that's related to someone that is in danger throughout the film! The potential was there, and wasn't met. From script to direction to storytelling decisions, Dead Men Tells No Tales has us wishing for the original writing team and the original director to somehow bring this franchise back to decent waters. This film only further enhances At World's End and Dead Man's Chest—two films that were met with ho-hum reviews but have honestly aged well and remain better than most of your modern-day blockbusters. The script here opens the door for many intriguing scenes, and they didn't deliver. We could have explored Jack Sparrow's aging and increasing alcoholism, Barbossa's past, the Flying Dutchman/Salazar curse connection, the fallout of the elongated separation of Will and Elizabeth, and the series-shifting scene of breaking every curse. And after seeing this, I don't have much hope in the eventual sixth installment touching these story lines either.The Pirates of the Caribbean series now looks like its more interested in the international box office receipts and just keeping people entertained above keeping the flavor of the franchise and keeping a continuity between each chapter. On Stranger Tides, despite the mediocrity, had interesting unresolved story lines that were completely neglected here. The original trilogy's details don't match up with the backstory of Jack Sparrow in Dead Men Tell No Tales.You will see some high-budget fun, comical mayhem, a good performance by Javier Bardiem, but it all gets evaporated when we reach the series-changing yet series-contradicting final act. The franchise is far from being dead, but boy it might be time to let this ship disappear out into the horizons unless we get a superior cast writing and filming it. Jack Sparrow and all his fans deserve much better.Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/"
tt1790809,5.0,"Sadly, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was just a mediocre film from a dying series of great films, and this film honestly brings nothing new to the table for this series. In a time full of cinematic universes, and unnecessary reboots, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't do anything special to wow audiences like it originally did almost 15 years ago. The film was full of mediocre acting, writing, visuals, and music, and is a film that will honestly just end up being forgotten like the film that came before it. In the end I decided to give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. It's heartbreaking to say, but I have to agree with what Mark Kennedy from the Associated Press said about this film. ""After this fifth episode, you'll wish Disney would just declare the franchise dead and tell no more tales.""Read more at theVade."
tt1790809,5.0,"The fifth installment of the Pirates-series is by all means a step up from the fourth. In all film-series, when a sequel is released it's mandatory to compare it to the best one - which in this case arguably everyone agrees is the first one. That may be unfair, but it's the reality. Now.Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge does give us some spectacular moments. The visual effects really is astonishing, and some of the scenes is beyond anything I have ever seen before. That's impressing. But that's not why I like Pirates of the Caribbean. What I expect (hope) from a Pirates-film is elegant and witty dialog, compelling sea- battles and Jack Sparrow on fire. And this last bit I think is the biggest reason why this one fails to deliver. In my opinion, Johnny Depp has lost his way as captain Jack. And I think that's natural, after all, it's been 13 years since he first portrait the character. He's gotten older and that really shows. This, combined with a really poor script, regarding Jack at least, makes it all fall apart. Half the time he's completely drunk (really drunk, not just usual Jack-tipsy) and half the time he tells bad jokes which really is beneath a genius character like Jack Sparrow. The film starts on a positive note. I had good hopes that it could go somewhere, but mid- way through the story starts to split up and it didn't really have a good rhythm to it. In addition I think there are a lot of characters that just don't do anything to the story or adds humor or dynamic. The decision to bring back Orlando Bloom to play Will Turner is fundamentally a good one, but I'm so disappointed with he's involvement in the film. It seems Disney only took him back to promote the film and lure old fans back for more. If he's to be involved, he should have a major role. Javier Bardem does a good job as villain, but nothing I will remember him by. All in all, I would say that I am disappointed. I didn't have huge expectations to begin with, but where I thought the film would deliver, it just didn't. Basically it's a film for the technical wizards to show how much they can do in terms of visual effects , and they can do a lot. It's just not what I want."
tt1790809,5.0,"Five winters after On Stranger Tides, some of the same key characters (and a few new ones) return for this latest high seas adventure. Callow sailor Henry Turner is on a personal mission to retrieve the Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact thought by many to be a myth. In the course of his journey he crosses paths—and eventually aligns himself with—wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and ambitious astronomer Carina Smyth. The mission is further complicated when they run afoul of Sparrow's 'frenemy' Captain Barbossa, and learn that a gang of undead sailors are coming their way. Follows essentially the same formula as The Curse of the Black Pearl, but the characters lack charisma (even Depp seems curiously subdued), the story is never really engaging, and all the rip-roaring action scenes and special effects can only carry this uninspired journey so far. Bardem effectively sneers and snarls as Captain Salazar, but he's one of the few highlights in an otherwise forgettable entry. **"

Film is running with a good pace overall and will keep you on edge. But the script is average, the chaos created is something that you have seen in so many similar movies and the idea is far from novel. Also some of the scenes in there just dot make sense or they feel a bit stupid.

The pacing was also good which can be tricky, not too frenetic, but also not with long dull parts of people looking off meaningfully into the distance.The worst part to me was the blistering stupidity of the two groups of people trying to steal the families wrist bands to get on a flight to safety. Equal stupidity goes to the family for not just handing them over. I would have thought that such high levels of idiocy didn't exist, or at least were astonishingly uncommon, however some of the things I see people believe these days has led me to reconsider.I gave this a six out of 10 because it is easy to watch but doesn't really bear much thinking about and teaches very little."

Formulaic working Joe who's doing better than average Joe's has a nice formulaic wife and family. Of course he loves them so much he has a Hallmark style photo is on his phone. He lives a formulaic life in the burbs but has had a few predictable personal problems with his better half. That's all disrupted by a nasty, inconvenient, formulaic extinction level disaster event.Yet, in spite of the fact he's presented as a working stiff, he and his family are ""special"". Their special bacon is, in fact, so postcard perfect, its to be plucked from the terrified ""expendable"" mob, that is humanity. If only they can get their entitled selves to Greenland.Thus starts a well choreographed, competently directed, special effects laden disaster romp that looks like every other disaster romp we have seen. It might not be boring if you are new to disaster flicks. If however, you have been around a few decades, its tired fare, that offers nothing terribly new or fresh. It also pushes the notion that we are all equal, whilst showing, quite clearly, we are not.5/10 from me."

The first fragment flattens the Tampa-St.Petersburg area with accompanying firestorms. Is tis how itended for the

family which is wife Morena Beccarin and son Roger Dale Floyd. The best scenes
in Greenland are between these people acting and functioning as a real family not some television type family unit.You can make plans, but things often don't go to plan. Especially in a situation

tt7737786,5.0,"I must admit that I was certainly expecting more from this 2020 disaster movie than what writer Chris Sparling and director Ric Roman Waugh actually managed to deliver with ""Greenland"".Well now, don't get me wrong, because I am not saying that this is a bad movie, nor am I saying it is a movie that isn't entertaining or enjoyable. It certainly was. However, the movie was just way too generic, mundane and predictable. And for a disaster movie, then I am afraid to say that the movie was frightfully devoid of massive scale destruction.Visually then ""Greenland"" was good, however, I was hoping to get to see a lot more destruction as the meteor and the fragments made contact with Earth. There were a few destruction scenes, and they most definitely were good to look at, no doubt about it. But for a disaster movie, then there just wasn't nowhere near enough of destruction and pure CGI mayhem throughout the course of this movie. It should be said, though, that the CGI and special effects that were in the movie definitely were convincing and looked very real and good on the screen. So thumbs up to the CGI and special effects crew.""Greenland"" felt more like a family drama laced with some end-of-the-world disaster theme. At no point throughout the course of the movie did I really feel like the world was about to end. Sure, it was mentioned in the movie and the premise was staged for it, but director Ric Roman Waugh just didn't come through. I have to admit that I didn't really sit down to watch ""Greenland"" because of the family drama going on between John Garrity (played by Gerard Butler) and Allison Garrity (played by Morena Baccarin) amidst an end-of-the-world scenario. No, I was here for the end of the world and the spectacular effects showcasing the destruction. But sadly, ""Greenland"" wasn't really all that great in terms of being a disaster movie.The movie does have a good ensemble of actors and actresses, and I will say that both Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin carried the movie quite well, and the child actor, Roger Dale Floyd, definitely also added something good with his performance. It was nice to see Scott Glenn in the movie, just a shame that he wasn't given more screen time.While ""Greenland"" is watchable and entertaining for what it turned out to be, I just felt cheated out of a grand disaster movie experience; one that I thought would have put the 2009 disaster movie ""2012"" to shame and knocked it off of its seat in the throne of disaster movies.My rating of ""Greenland"", once the ash has settled, stands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars. The movie was just way too generic and following a very strict run-of-the-mill-how-to-make-a-disaster-movie blueprint."
tt9639470,6.0,"His conquered the living dead with nothing more than unwanted vinyl records, alien invaders in small country towns and even managed to wrangle baby drivers but there's no doubt Last Night in Soho is beloved British director and critical darling Edgar Wright's most ambitious film yet and a film that doesn't always reach the lofty goals it sets for itself even if its a beautifully shot and unique thriller mixed with horror elements.His first film narrative feature film since Baby Driver in 2017, Soho is undoubtedly a labor of love for Wright who produces his most un-Wright feeling film yet, that follows Thomasin McKenzie's country girl fashion designer to London, where her rental of a small bedroom apartment leads her to experience vivid and increasingly frightening visions into the life of a seemingly real London resident of the 60's named Sandie (a mesmerizing Anya Taylor-Joy) creating a very late 60's/70's feeling feature that struggles to keep itself on the rails as the runtime wears on.Magnificently capturing the time and place of the London era of the setting with help from Old Boy and Handmaiden cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung (delivering Oscar worthy work) and some eclectic and toe tapping concoction of classic tunes from the era that once more suggests Wright is right up there with Quentin Tarantino when it comes to sound-tracking his films and particular scenes, Soho has a lot to admire and for its first 30 to 40 minutes things rollick along at a great pace with a lot of intrigue in what's happening and what's around the corner but the film does get into a mid to late section funk that becomes both repetitive and a little too much to handle narrative wise.You can see what Wright was trying too do and how he wanted his film to evolve but that doesn't excuse the loop we end up getting stuck in and the sometimes questionable choices that Eloise makes (with some added overacting by a trying hard but not always hitting the mark McKenzie) and while visually and atheistically everything is always of a very high standard, there's a coldness to the story of Soho and it never quite works as well as you'd like as a mystery or a fully fledged horror that it at times appears to be wanting to be.In amongst all of the narrative let downs and feeling that it never quite hits the marks it sets for itself is the continued great work of Taylor-Joy whose growing into one of the most interesting actors working today, a fairly chilling performance from the usually likable Matt Smith and a central plot that at the very least doesn't play things out in the usual schtick, making Soho far from a complete misfire but nothing more than an intriguing could've been film that I am sure Wright and his fanbase will look back on in days to come as a missed opportunity to create something spectacular.Final Say -A film that sets itself a tricky task its never fully able to handle, Last Night in Soho is a high quality feature that can't ever quite juggle its various elements into a final product that feels worthy of its goals.3 Vesper's out of 5."
tt9639470,5.0,"There's a solid giallo-esque thriller inside this lumbering mess of a film. Director Edgar Wright has style yo spare, bathing this nightmarish London in neon lights that exude both danger and glamor. The re-creations of Swinging London in the flashbacks are also impressive, clearly crafted down to the last detail. Too bad the story sucks.This is one of those films where the main character is hysterical and naive, and while this is meant to be endearing and sympathetic, I was done with her within the first half hour. The other characters are all flat, from the too good to be true love interest to the twist villain.Worst of all is how repetitive the middle of the movie is. Ellie is constantly bombarded by visions of vile men, their hands groping at her (is this an homage to Polanski's REPULSION or plagiarism?). It's initially creepy-- then it just becomes rote and boring and overblown.Maybe if this were an 80 minute movie with 95% less CG ghosts, we'd actually have something manageable. Not good necessarily, but certainly more enjoyable."

It's just the same scene over and over and over, her seeing ghosts and freaking out. Anya Taylor-Joy is fetching in a smaller role, but woefully underused. The ending is just downright stupid, with clunky exposition just outright telling the audience what's happening when the film begs for an ending far more enigmatic.This is like a David Lynch wannabe made by someone without Lynch's artistry or smarts.Grade: C."
tt9639470,6.0,"I went on an Edgar Wright binge during lockdown, half just to see them again and half with an eye on the fact that ""Last Night in Soho"" was due out when the lockdown lifted. Though I generally would say that I liked the film, unfortunately I felt the conclusion let it down.Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie) moves from Cornwall to London to become a fashion designer. Obsessed with 1960's culture, she struggles to make friends and leaves the halls of residence for a flat in a house owned by Ms Collins (Diana Rigg). On her first night, she dreams about Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy) a singer who came to Soho in the 1960's and who fell in with Jack (Matt Smith). As the dreams mix with reality, Eloise comes to question her sanity, what happened to Sandie and who the silver haired gentleman (Terence Stamp) hanging around the city might be.The stuff that I admired most about the film were related to the performances and to Edgar Wright's direction. There is some very clever work done during the dream/haunting sequences to relay that the characters of Eloise and Sandie are both living the same life and the Eloise is watching it from a distance. There's a dance scene, which is very cleverly choreographed so that both characters can dance with Jack without cutting away. Anya Taylor-Joy really can do anything and make it compelling but as a Giallo-esque femme fetale / victim she's at her most arresting. Smith is a convincing charming heavy though he doesn't feature in the film as much as the girls. Thomasin McKenzie carries an excellent Cornishy accent through the film, and keeps Eloise likable, even when she becomes overwhelmed.But... I'm not convinced that the story matches up with the talent elsewhere. I don't think the film makes as much sense as it thinks it does, in its conclusion. (Sorry if that sounds vague, bit I'm trying to write without spoilers). Its twist is relatively easy to see coming, though some of the dialogue details from earlier in the film hit differently once you know. I also don't think it's particularly scary, and the ""ghosts"" in the film aren't an especially well-done effect.Overall, I enjoyed my time with the film but I can't help and think of it as a missed opportunity for something truly special."
tt9639470,5.0,"No one could accuse this film of not being sufficiently unique, glossy, and ambitious. There is a plethora of originality and brilliant ideas in this film.It's just that the screenplay doesn't seem concerned with anything other than ambition or style. The writers don't care if it makes sense, so long as it looks cool and feels weird.The first half of the film is filled with intrigue, but that intrigue gradually crumbles as the repetitive dream sequences drag on and as more information is revealed.The plot twist at the film's climax is supremely obvious and it makes no sense, not even bothering to answer the sole question that the story has been posing: where are Ellie's visions coming from and why?There are several intriguing characters, plot threads. And themes that are completely abandoned in favor of ineffective jump scare sequences that add nothing to the story.Lastly, NONE of the horror elements work here. None of the scares are earned-just thrown in with loud noises for cheap thrills.Edgar Wright, stick to comedy and action. It's what you're good at."
tt9639470,5.0,"So it's been 4 years since Edgar Wright last made a film since the hit 2017 film, Baby Driver & now finally, after a year of being pushed back we get this film!The film follows a young girl Eloise, who goes off to London to study fashion design at university. But when she moves into a flat temporarily for somewhere to stay, she starts to have dream/visions of a young girl in the 1960's who seems to be having the time of her life until she is brutally murdered. It is then Eloise starts to be attacked by apparitions& ghosts as she tries to unravel the mystery surrounding this young girl & the room she's staying in.I found the film to be interesting, I didn't much into what the story was about despite seeing previews, so I sort of walked into this one blind, but knew it was a horror so that's why I went to see it (obviously). I was actually lead to believe this film was set in the 60's until 5 minutes in roughly. The story keeps you wondering as the film progresses & it's then you start to understand what's going on, but the dream sequences do drag somewhat & the hallucination scenes (while great the first time around) do get pretty annoying after a while.The characters were pretty flat & the female lead lacked charisma & believability. The twist, while surprising wasn't great & I have to say the films message felt like a snipe at men with the themes, undertones & implications, not to mention the treatment of most of the male characters in the film who were either looked upon a evil or potential red herrings. The film did drag at 1 hour & 51 minutes & had some pacing issues here & there.The eye candy for the actresses & the gore were however good & there was a great sinister undertone in the film also.The film overall, is mediocre & not as great as made out. The themes, undertones & implications don't help & I do hope if & when Baby Driver 2 gets released & made that Edgar Wright doesn't follows with these themes in the film.5/10."
tt9639470,5.0,"Maybe shooting for a David Lynch/Alfred Hitchcock/Michael Powell thing wasn't the best idea. The film drags on with its repetitiveness and really could have been trimmed up by twenty minutes.I am not entirely sure which of the 400 nights depicted was supposed to line up with the main theme of the lyrics of the titular song that plays over the end credits. So some aspects like that seemed shoehorned in for style-over-substance purposes. Normally we can enjoy the overly-contrived production and narrative of a Wright film because of the comedic and farcical elements. But this movie is attempting for the serious psychological and supernatural thriller thing. But the chronic appearance of the you-know-whats that she sees really starts to grate on the viewer.While it began decent, it just hammers at the same points until it experiences a resolution."
tt8550054,5.0,"I didn't think this story was all that compelling or satisfyingly told. There were some details that were memorable, but I really didn't get invested in where it was going. I will agree that the lead actress did an amazing job, and most everyone else brought a realism to their roles, especially since they work in the adult film industry in real life. But I didn't feel like there was much connection between the scenes. Yes, the overall goal of the main character remains consistent, but I didn't feel like we were shown what motivated her to make the specific choices she did much of the time. The effect is that the story doesn't really progress and build believably. Even though it has an outstanding central performance, I felt this was a fairly average drama overall which happened to have a few scenes that were difficult to watch."
tt8550054,6.0,"It's pretty much true that everytime there's a mainstream movie about the adult industry, it always focuses on the extremes on one end; where there tends to be a very anti-porn industry undertone that guides these movies.So when you're making a movie about the industry with many actual performers showing up as themselves, there was the risk of it being extreme on the pro-industry end. But to my pleasant surprise, the movie composed itself with a lot of nuance on both ends of the argument to share its story without a strong bias on either side; something I very much appreciate. Pleasure is a very decent movie, but with very little originality in my opinion. Yes, I liked its tone overall, but the story plays out exactly the way you'd think it would by the first 15 minutes. It certainly wasn't boring, but it never captivated as much as it had the potential to, and that's something I wish this movie could have done different.Overall however, it was a decent watch, but more importantly, it was made with the right frame of mind... and that's what truly stood out to me."
tt8550054,6.0,"The story of a 19-year-old Swedish beauty who makes her way to Hollywood in order to become the next big porn star. The film has rightly had its fair share of publicity, due to the graphic scenes featured throughout. However, that shock value soon wears thin, leaving a somewhat hollow tale of cold-hearted loneliness. Still, it earns a slim recommendation due to a stunning central performance from newcomer, Sofia Kappel."
tt8550054,6.0,"Pleasure showcases the raw reality of the modern adult film industry and the people in it. While boys will be boys, this movie focuses more on the women that are involved in front and behind the camera. Although this is a business, some choose pleasure. In the end, it comes down to what that pleasure truly is. Whether it be love, acceptance, fame, money, friendship or true meaning, this movie is successful in capturing the naiveness that the central character has. It is a true representation of the adult film industry as it captures so many real depictions of the people that make up that world."
tt8550054,6.0,"This story is about Bella's journey, but it felt more like a walk around the block. This film suffered many rookie filmmaking mistakes, the biggest being its failure to effectively deliver its message effectively about its bold subject matter. It had a lot of style, but very little substance. In the film's 109 min runtime, there are far too many long and dragged out scenes, and with the slow pacing, the film just dragged on. This may have worked better as a short film, or needed stronger filmmakers to tune up the directing and writing. The story lacked character depth, and wasted time with roommate dynamics instead of focusing more on the industry dynamics. There certainly were touches and flashes on the narrative's message, but they were too narrow, hollow and simplistic. It's well shot with decent cinematography with an adequate score and performances, but sadly, it ended up being limp."
tt8550054,6.0,"I am very open-minded when it comes to the subject matter of this movie and I do agree with many others that Sofia Kappel was actually remarkably good in this, especially for a first timer.Although I have no personal problem with porn at all, it is the exploitation of those such as the Bella character in this movie that gives me cause for concern. Of course there are those who will say that viewers of porn are a large part of the problem. However, it is those who are actually in the porn industry who must bear the shame of the exploitation that obviously occurs there.This is not a bad movie by any means. But it was strange to me at least that the producers of the movie seemingly had little problem with showing the male actors in full naked detail while very largely keeping away from nudity among the female characters.I didn't mind the movie apart from the nastiness of some of think are called the ""Gonzo"" scenes depicted but it is not actually a movie that I'm ever very likely to seek out again.6/10 from me."
tt2527338,5.0,"... which is that there was no overarching story to this trilogy planned.Say what you will about the prequels -years later they aren't considered secretly great or misunderstood. But they did one thing right. They expanded the universe of Star Wars with more world building and more lore, some good, some bad. The prequel story, while stilted, was the product of a single vision. In the end you had bad execution with good building blocks.The Sequel Trilogy doesn't expand anything, instead it makes everything smaller. Star Wars has never felt so small and tired as it does after The Rise of Skywalker. Each movie exists just to tear down and apologize for what came before it. Anakin/Vader's entire character arc is completely and unforgivably undermined after this film.Overall the movie was so bloated and overstuffed with choppy pacing to course-correct from The Last Jedi. It's Flanderization in action. The original movies had so many little touches and so much atmosphere and craftsmanship beyond a few big reveals, neat action set pieces, and bizarre coincidences with the same ten people running into one another over and over. The original films built iconic imagery and characters in the context of them doing things and bonding and building. This was not always perfectly done, but it was done well enough to feel meaningful.You can't just write a movie with the assumption you already have all of those things and skip the work it takes to get them. You can trick people for awhile by using the familiar imagery and beats and deconstructing the world with meta-humor (Abrams did that well for The Force Awakens if nothing else), but you just cash in that goodwill and cheapen all of that stuff by association.Oh well, the big action movies these days are indeed made for children and China - I can't remember who recently said that, but it's true."
tt2527338,5.0,"Saw 'The Rise of Skywalker' just before Christmas with my sister, but it took me a while to gather my thoughts on it. Being not sure what rating to give it or how to express my opinion on the film. Will admit that when seeing it in the cinema, to me it was enjoyable but had a lot of faults. Since watching 'The Rise of Skywalker' then though, the more it has been thought about the more it has gone down in my estimations. My reservations felt back then still remain the same, as well as what struck me was good, while thinking of more since.My opinions on the previous 'Stars Wars' films were much more definite, being a fan of the original trilogy and while the prequel trilogy had a lot of flaws to me they weren't that bad. Also thought 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi' were better than expected (am aware that possible blasphemy has been committed here), but 'The Last Jedi' certainly had a lot wrong with it. 'Solo' was good fun on its own terms too. Absolutely judging it from an open mind, 'The Rise of Skywalker' left me very conflicted however and ended the trilogy on a whimper rather than a bang, it's not deserving of a 1/10 but it is not near deserving in my opinions of the 10/10s mostly given to counter the negativity in classic critic bashing style. Of the franchise, this was the one in all honesty that left me the most disappointed.Will start with the good things with 'The Rise of Skywalker'. It is gorgeously shot and designed and the special effects are often a marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films.There are some great performances here, Daisy Ridley carries the film outstandingly, having become more confident with each film, and Adam Driver is menacing and conflicted. Carrie Fisher again brings nostalgic poignancy to Leia, while John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are charismatic and do their best with what they were given (which was quite weak in my view) and how great it was to see Ian McDiarmid again as Palpatine, again his material was not great but he does a good job with it. Chewbacca is as adorable and funny as ever and C-3PO provided a few amusing moments. Babu Frik was a nice new addition and there were a couple of touching and nostalgic moments. Some of the action is thrilling, namely the extended blaster battle and Rey and Kylo's force-based clash.For all those good things, 'The Rise of Skywalker' has a lot of major flaws. With so little time to breathe in the story, the film feels far too rushed which made it very difficult to digest the more convoluted parts of the story. There is also too much going on so the film feels very cramped by the final act, and also too many characters. Some are fun but too many of them are underused or even pointless and tacked on, such as Lando and Rose Tico. Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford only seemed to be there for nostalgia purposes and are merely walk-ons.Although the action has its moments, too much of it doesn't rouse like it should do and is in a way forgettable. The big reveal that has been much discussed here made absolutely no sense (the atmosphere felt at that part in the packed auditorium in the cinema was like a uniform ""what the heck?"") and really convoluted the storytelling later on, leading to a conclusion that felt rather too anti-climactic and made a waste of the characters involved in it. A long way from a bang. Morever, the dialogue is as bad and even downright laughable than the worst of the prequel trilogy's with far too much exposition and unrealistic conveniences.Overall, have seen far worse but a big disappointment. If some people liked it, good for you. It just didn't work for me and many others, for reasons that are valid, and it is inexplicable as to why people have an inability to accept that, and not just for this film but for almost every film here. 5/10"
tt2527338,5.0,"I went to see this new Star Wars movie tonight--a few weeks after it opened to tepid reviews. Well, after seeing it I can understand some of the lack of enthusiasm for ""The Rise of Skywalker"", as it suffers from a HUGE problem...I felt pretty much indifferent to it. I would have preferred it if the movie has really sucked...then I would have had fun laughing at it.I won't recount the plot here...mostly because the film was non-stop and most plot elements lasted mere minutes. The folks went from one deadly fight to another to another to another...and much of the first portion of the film turned out to be unnecessary.I am NOT a 'Comicbook Guy' who complains that the film isn't true to the original three or other such nonsense. I have gone to all the films and enjoyed them (with the exception of ""Episode 3""...but few enjoyed that movie)...and I really enjoyed some of the more recent ones. But I disliked much of ""Episode IX"" because it seems like J.J. Abrams is trying to undo so much of what Rian Johnson did in ""Episode VIII"". Sad...but I liked ""Episode VIII"". Instead of relationships and characters, ""Episode IX"" is pretty much only about explosions, near misses and more explosions....as well as long dead characters suddenly coming back to life for no good reason.All in all, a joyless mass of explosions and a film I should have just skipped. The theater also was showing ""Knives Out"" (By Johnson) and that film was FUN. ""Star Wars: Episode IX"" is simply un-fun."
tt15789472,5.0,"The story sounded intriguing enough - a young family escaping from a totalitarian regime gone wrong with the pregnant woman ending up trapped in a shipping container. This setup would have already given more than enough basis for a very entertaining movie but no - it was also necessary to throw in an overly dramatic and completely unrealistic birthing scene, followed by some unnecessary gore and even more drama. I get that the biblical references were probably supposed to be deep and thoughtful, but adding a CGI whale just makes the whole thing even more absurd.While the acting was passable, the main charakters passiveness in the first half of the movie was infuriating - with all the necessary tools available it still takes her a good two thirds of the movie to find the solution that was right in front of her the whole time.Ever since Titanic, movie makers should also know that their audience is also aware of the effects of staying on water for too long. While people at Burning Men were already complaing about Trenchfoot after two days, the otherwise pretty whiny main character had no issues staying in salt water for quite significant amounts of time let alone the issue of water temperature and hypothermia.Overall the movie felt like a Tupperware commercial with too much artificial drama instead of just making use of what the setting provides naturally."
tt7798634,5.0,"READY OR NOT is an interesting film but also a deeply flawed one that's never quite as funny or as entertaining as it tries to be. I liked the whole idea of the sinister rich family in their wonderful 'old dark house' inspired mansion and the idea of the heroine being hunted down, a little like the French flick FRONTIERS. Unfortunately what promises to be a TURKEY SHOOT-style cat and mouse story of human hunting turns into a largely aimless comedy with repetitive set-pieces and a sub-par script substituting bad language for wit. It's a pity, as the direction is solid and the performances are strong, but imagine this cast with proper dialogue to play with! I also found the climax a cop out as I was expecting this kind of over-obvious thing to happen. Not a bad film, just something I was expecting more from."
tt7798634,6.0,"Wow what a silly story i was shaking my head in disbelief all the way thru .... but gotta say it is an enjoyable romp and i loved the ending but i can see people really hating the whole film , just turn your brain off and enjoy the sillyness .....!!!!!"
tt7798634,6.0,Anyone rating this movie a 1 or 2 probably only watches 5-10 movies a year. I've watched over 100 this year and can say that this one isn't bad. It's a fun Dark comedy Thriller. Easily a 6-8 depending on preference.
tt13403046,6.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. Discotheques and Night Clubs were regularly referred to as 'meat markets', and all movie lovers are familiar with the term 'meet-cute'. It's rare for meat and meet to merge into a cautionary tale of modern-day dating, but that's what we get from director Mimi Cave's first feature film and a script from Lauryn Kahn (IBIZA, 2018). This twisted film should slide easily into the Midnight Movie rotation for those looking for a slicer, rather than a slasher.Daisy Edgar-Jones (""Normal People"", 2020) stars as Noa, a twenty-something frustrated with the results of digital dating apps. Her experience is a case study on the challenges of meeting someone special, or even someone not psychotic, through a dating app. She swipes right on a cute puppy picture, and almost immediately receives an unwanted 'private' shot. When she does agree to have dinner with one guy, he criticizes her fashion, yearns for old-fashioned femininity, makes her pay half, and doesn't bother to hold the door for her. Noa tells her close friend Mollie (Jojo T Gibbs) that she's done with dating for a while, and who can blame her?Not long after that trainwreck date, and when she's least expecting it, Noa gets her meet-cute in the produce aisle at the grocery store. Steve (Sebastian Stan who plays Bucky Barnes in the Marvel Universe) is a charming, good-looking guy and she agrees to give him her number. Their first date is filled with the usual background Q&A stuff, but it's clear that Noa and Steve have some chemistry. The reason this works cinematically is that director Cave allows us to view Steve through Noa's eyes. Just like her, we are diligently searching for red flags, remaining on high alert for signs something is off. But plastic surgeon Steve's early warning signs only become noticeable much later (too late) after his true self is revealed.Steve's true-self-revelation is a doozy, and the opening credits pop up just after the gut-punch, approximately 40 minutes in. While the first act plays a bit like a traditional rom-com with all the associated romantic awkwardness, the stunningly plausible shift jerks us and Noa in a different direction. Additional supporting work is provided by Dayo Okeniyi as an initially helpful bartender whose recognition of horror film tropes prevent him from taking any heroic action, and Charlotte Le Bon as a surprise addition to the proceedings. But it's the performances and the twisted chemistry of Ms. Edgar-Jones and Mr. Stan that allows the premise to work and Act 3 to not quite slip into full blown absurdity. Without giving anything else away, I can admit that this referendum on dating and people, presented as a horror film, struck me as a blend of PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN (2020), GET OUT (2017), and a personal favorite, EATING RAOUL (1982).Streaming exclusively on HULU beginning March 4, 2022."
tt13403046,6.0,"Firstly imagine how much money Steve would have made off of Sheila from Santa Clarita diet. Fresh is not what I expected, it's not a comedy and even though it's quite gory I can't call it a horror either but that's the nearest genre you could give it. It's not there to scare you out your couch or sleep; maybe out of your dating life but that's about it. It's a romance gone wrong. I like how it combines two of my favorite genres because I'm a sucker for lovey dovey movies but then it takes a turn. The first part of the movie is quite normal, girl with an inauspicious dating life to say the least, meets a seemingly nice guy and they hit off. A meet-cute I believe it's called. The opening credits roll in after 30min as if to signal the end to that and start of something else. A 30min intro.I guess it's the hopeless romantic side of me that led me to believe for a split second this was going to turn into a romcom, then it didn't and I thought oh so he's gonna end up being the molesting type, and it took another, even worse turn. All my premeditations just kept getting crossed out for something worse so I just stopped assuming. My assumptions were actually going to be easier to stomach than how it actually turned out. And how he thought he could get Noa to see things his way too, I guess that's how he met his wife Ann so he probably thought he could pull it off.It's really quite a shocking and decent film, in an unsettling way and I liked it. It's not gory enough to put off an average viewer; it somehow sits on the edge where both a horror fan and non-fan could enjoy the movie. I think they should be a genre for movies like this one, like ""Promising Young Woman"", or ""the invisible man"" which I did love but didn't find it frightening enough to call a horror. And this definitely isn't a comedy, I don't know why it's described as such. It's uncomfortable to watch yet entertaining at the same time because it doesn't let itself become unwatchable which it easily could have been and I think that's exquisite directing."
tt13403046,5.0,"I must admit that I was initially intrigued by the synopsis for this 2022 thriller titled ""Fresh"" from writer Lauryn Kahn and director Mimi Cave. However, I hadn't heard about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it, so I wasn't sure what I was in for here. But with it being a new movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to give the movie a viewing.And while the concept idea behind ""Fresh"" certainly was interesting or fresh, pardon the pun, then it was a movie that was oddly bland and generic. Sure, there were aspects to the storyline that had weight and leverage to it, but overall, then the movie was just lacking spice, pardon the pun.Sure, it was a fun jab at today's meat market with the dating apps and services, I get that, but at the same time the movie was just a bit too generic and predictable.""Fresh"" has a relatively small cast ensemble, but I will say that the actors and actresses in the movie definitely rose to the occasion and carried the movie quite well. It was just a shame that they had so little to work with in terms of a properly entertaining and enjoyable script. I was not familiar with the cast that performed in the movie, so that was something that I enjoyed at least.Visually then ""Fresh"" was adequate. It is not a gory movie, as director Mimi Cave doesn't delve into the full-blown gore and macabre. Most of the gruesome things are left to the imagination, for better or worse.I found ""Fresh"" to be suitable for a single viewing, but that was about it. This is not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, as the storyline just simply doesn't have the ingredients to support more than a single serving, pardon the pun.My rating of ""Fresh"" lands on a very bland five out of ten stars."
tt13403046,5.0,"Daisy Edgar-Jones of ""Normal People"" fame and Sebastian Stan currently portraying Tommy Lee in ""Pam & Tommy"" have cemented themselves as favorites in my book, so just seeing their names attached to this project turns this into a must-see. Furthermore, the premise description and trailer are respectful enough not to give out spoilers, and instead the movie actually goes out of its way to keep the mystery until about 50 minutes into the story. When it gets going though, it's all silly, full of contrived moments. However, the one specific revenge act is quite satisfying to watch, I must admit. Overall this is a mixed bag, which you can actually follow along by just having it playing in the background while doing something else."
tt13403046,5.0,"Just as she tires of the dating scene, a woman meets her ideal man ... but he only wants her for her body.Latest episode in the Canadian (and French) obsession with body horror. It's an aesthetic that doesn't happen to appeal to me - each to his own - but when it manages to reveal something about life I'm all ... pierced ears.This opens as a well written rom-com, with a long prologue nicely observing a bad date and the gallows-humour shared by veterans of the dating-trenches. Then it all goes wrong as we plunge in to the psycho-captivity of a serial killer, which leads to a pretty bland sequence of events.The production is stylish, performances good, and the music interesting - sometimes ironic or humorous. A big problem is that the action in the climax is handled ineptly as the actors flounce about to little purpose. But the biggest problem is that it's all one long platitude: through no fault of their own, women are badly treated by men and are entitled to stick up for themselves. And it takes 114 mins to tell us what we knew all along. To make things worse, there's only a vague insight into the killer and the people around him (one of whom appears and disappears without explanation), so the scenario just presents as a flat revenge fantasy. The most intriguing character is the killer's wife, but the reason for her role in the cruelty passes by without a thought.Watch Eat (2014) instead, a genuine body horror with something to say about craziness."
tt13403046,6.0,"This is one of those films that actually has a really really interesting and out of left field twist that works in part........however the longer the film goes on the more silly, uninteresting and just plan dull the film gets. It needed a big ending and we didn't really get that sadly. It ends the way you thought it was going to end.Fantastic build up until then though, the first 45 minutes to an hour are really good!! Sebastian Stan and Daisy Edgar-Jones have great chemistry on screen but its not enough to keep me engaged towards the end.I will probably forget about this film and never watch it again, which is a shame!! It just needed one more reveal or twist towards the last 30 minutes and it might have stuck the landing........however that didn't happen, played it safe with the victims being saved. Which is odd considering the rest of the film isn't safe whatsoever!60% out of 100 its ok but had potential to me much much better than that!"
tt13403046,5.0,"Fresh stars Daisy Edgar-Jones, Sebastion Stan and Jonica T. Gibbs, and is directed by Mimi Cave in her directorial debut.It tells the story of 20-something, Noa, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones, trying to navigate the modern dating world. After a disappointing dating experience, she happens upon the charming, charismatic, seemingly harmless Steve, played by Sebastian Stan, who takes her on holiday to his fortress-like summer home very early in their relationship, where he holds her and several other women captive in order to harvest their flesh to sell to rich male consumers.Barely ever has a movie got me so into it and loving it in the first act, only to fall into something that I thought was really stupid in the final act. The first half hour is masterful. Before a belated title card and opening credits, not unlike The Empty Man, the opening scene is her on a date with someone, where any and every awkward and unpleasant moment of a date gone wrong is shown to us in such an astutely cringey way that it's genius. The film is then paced excellently, as she meets Steve, they get to know each other, we meet her sassy best friend, played by Jonica T. Gibbs, all leading to one of the better drink-spiking scenes I've seen in a movie.The final act then becomes a barrage of plot holes, predictable moments, and oddly inconsistent character behaviour. There's a bartender character who was completely unnecessary to even be in the movie, and when he has the opportunity to do something useful at Steve's summer home, he gets scared and leaves. There are little moments of violence that seemed brashly childish and unsubtle, and whereas the scathing humour of the nightmares of dating in the first act actually worked, the darkly sadistic humour in the final act fell flat on its face (sometimes literally).Steve's main objective of harvesting the meat of women is to sell the meat to mega rich male cannibals (the 1% of the 1% as Steve calls the market), who pay a hefty dollar to consume these decadent delicacies. There is an interesting comment to be made there along the lines of: men who have everything, who have endless resources at their disposal, who are untouchable, who have no doubt done terrible things to get where they are - what more can they do to brandish their endless power? Perhaps the only thing left is to literally consume the meat of women to fulfill their unfulfillable, extravagant lives. There could be a criticism to be made on the mega rich 1% - when is enough enough, or is it ever enough? But the film just doesn't go there.It's an impressive directing debut, Mimi Cave has a distinct vision and style, and I'm keen to see what she does next. But the silliness of the final act, and the missed opportunity to really say something about the mega rich brought this one down for me."
tt18363072,5.0,"I read the description of this movie expecting either a drama or a crime movie, but I got neither. What I did get to see was a portrait of an Australian pub. Period. Sometimes a bit rowdy as in any pub. And that's it. What the what?The bad: this story is going nowhere. 2 female pub employees serve beer and ocassionally hang out with some of the pub visitors. Wanna watch that for 90 minutes long? I got bored.There is a final to this story that does not make sense at all, making me further question the capabilities of the writer of this script.Kinda tedious. Kinda lame. Nothing much happens except some common pub rowdiness. And that is suppose to be the basis of an entire movie?Not any good then? Jennifer Garner is a great actress. SHE was THE reason I started watching this movie, but her performance cant cover up the simple fact that this story is void of any drama or thrill. What a dud."
tt18363072,6.0,"This movie is a dramatic interpretation of the documentary film ""hotel coolgardie"" (I reviewed that also on IMDb)It tells the story of two backpackers travelling through Australia and they take up a job via a job agency (very common in Australia backpacking community). Only downside the hotel is in south Australia in a mining location.They are met with a culture shock of how rough the men are and how the women have to cope with chauvinism.The movie portrays real life in the mining towns of southern Australia where the pub is the main gathering location and where men drink far too much.There are a few scenes where artistic license is used to make for a more dramatic movie but all in all it's a true reflection of the experiences many female travellers have.I recommend to watch and then view ""Hotel Coolgardie"" to compare."
tt18363072,5.0,"I didn't know much about this film, but I really didn't expect this.For the entire hour and 30 minutes, I kept waiting for something significant to happen, but nothing did.Why on earth would two girls go to the middle of the desert to work in a bar were bunch of people get drunk and do stupid things. That's the story in a nutshell, then they get to meet bunch of dudes who want to have a good time with them, but one of them gets violent, so one of the girls tries to stop him.I can't understand why this film was made or what it was trying to say, truly pointless to me and a true waste of time and talent."
tt18363072,5.0,"Ugh...where do I begin. The film is a dog. A pointless, boring, series of missed chances to land some useful commentary. The fact this film is even circulating right now is testament to just how bad the selection of available films in the US is at the moment.Julia Garner in her OLD hair (c. 2019) bores us with the prospect of a stunning performance...because that's what the marketing promises. Surprise! No such thing...instead we get a series of events punctuated by alcohol (so ""1960"") and lonely dysfunctional isolated men...(oh hey! That's new! NOT!) All the tension is queued up for a meaningful something-or-other but voila...no delivery... instead audiences are punished with a closeup of Garner mopping up vomit. Yay!Skip this one..."
tt18363072,5.0,"OK so Garner and Renwick play 2 girls off on an adventure working in a remote hotel in Australia. Instead of enjoying all the adventures they envisaged, they encounter misogyny and scares.First off I have to say that Hugo Weaving is at his best, as ever. Watch it solely if you are a fan of his. Garner also (I'm a huge fan) plays a great, well developed role and I was 100% immersed in her character. Renwick does a great job of being Garners 'wingman'.So, acting is fine throughout and characters are well defined. Why only a 5? Well, I suspect in the back of the writers' heads they had an idea of a scary misogynistic world that innocent and unsuspecting girls had wandered into. Then I thought, it was a coming of age for Garner's character, and a wake up call to Renwick's character.Then I realised that was definitely an element of girl power in there, blatantly stating that no matter what you awful men throw at us we will triumph because we have girl power! Garner's character at one point takes a hit to the head with an axe and calmly get's up and smashes the bar up lol
There were very few scary parts, but there was a tension and a malevolence constantly apparent, even though there wasn't much to suggest it.Then the very weird ending has them calmly walking, bloodied, off into the sunset as the entire hotel burns to ashes behind them. It's almost apocalyptic and the ending does not mirror the rest of the film.So, could have been an outstanding film with a fabulous cast, ended up being a 'meh' or even a 'huh?' due to poor direction."
tt18363072,6.0,"It's currently a few weeks after the release of 'The Royal Hotel' and I realised before watching it that I had heard absolutely nothing about it. Nothing positive, nothing negative, not even a single reference to it on any social media platform. I now understand why. The film is completely unremarkable in every way. It's a perfectly fine film, but 12 hours from now I doubt I will ever think about it again.I can't remember seeing many films like this where there is zero elevation in the script. Thing's start a certain way, stay that way for 90 minutes and then the film ends. I looked at my watch at one point and saw there were only 5 minutes to go and didn't think that was possible. Surely there's a whole third act still to come, I thought. Nope. The film just ends.The sad thing was the starting point was fine. If it had elevated things from there it could've been something special. Instead all this film will serve as is likely a warning film that backpackers heading to Australia should watch before they leave. There's not much else to say about it. 6/10."
tt0232500,6.0,"Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) wants to join the family of the head of California street racing (Vin Diesel)...but why?The plot is comic book level; the dialogue is very VERY bad...but who really cares?  This is a throwback of those dumb 1970s drive-in movies...it's for people who like loud, fast films filled with mindless action, attractive women, cars...and nothing else.  I didn't like the film.  It was too loud, too silly and way too long for a dumb action flick.  What saves it is some truly incredible action sequences (the ""hijacking"" sequence towards the end was unbelievable), some very nice, innovative direction, a cast that manages to be good despite the script and a very good performance by Vin Diesel. This was supposed to be Walker's breakthrough film but Diesel steals it away.  Also it looks kind of silly to have tall, lean, pretty boy Walker against tall, muscular, severe-looking Diesel.See it for the action and Diesel.  During the slow spots admire the cars or the women."
tt3748172,5.0,"I really fancied this having watches a trailer, but as is so often the case, the best bits were shown in the trailer, and the film itself was ultimately a disappointment. The writing is clever, the story is best, but as the story is literally handcuffed (no pun intended) it does limit the scope. It's well acted, it's certainly different, I just found it too hard to get into. 5/10"
tt3748172,5.0,"OK, I didn't realize until just now (after I'd seen the film) that this is based on a Stephen King novel. Well, no doubt in 400 pages or whatever he was able to manage enough psychological depth to pull off what ends up seeming pretty heavy-handed and contrived here. ""Game"" has a good premise, and I've liked this director's other movies, but once the central jeopardy kicks in, there's barely any time given to developing its elemental suspense before they start piling on the imaginary figures from her subconscious who advise and/or taunt the heroine during her extreme travail--a lazy fantasy plot device I've always hated. Then it turns out that the story isn't really ""How will she free herself from literal chains"" but ""How will she use this time to free herself from the mental chains of childhood sexual abuse,"" as related in flashbacks. So what you start out thinking will be a thriller instead becomes a confronting-the-past tale of self-empowerment. Themes like incest are trivialized by a context like ""I'm remembering my abuse cuz I'm stuck handcuffed to the bed by my husband who just died of a heart attack."" So while well-acted and directed, this just felt like a case where the earnest dramatic elements canceled out the horror elements, and vice versa. Not a personal best for Mike Flanagan."
tt10954600,6.0,"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out."
tt10954600,6.0,"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park."
tt10954600,5.0,"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging seemed just flat and disinterested here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being a complete snooze fest. I was actually bored fir much if the film.Just below average in an MCU that is just churning out film after film with diminishing results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films good when they first started. They are getting so formulaic and forgettable.Below average.....Grade: C-"
tt10954600,6.0,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me."
tt10954600,6.0,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe.(3 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023, 10/5/2023)"
tt10954600,6.0,"Marvel really has fallen and it can't get up. This is the third legacy character that they've absolutely wasted. In fact, for Doctor Strange, Thor and Ant-Man they not only wasted great established characters but superb casts. Add that they made Kang, the main villain out to be a chump and it appears Marvel has no plan moving forward. Not Kiang the conqueror but Kang the chump.This movie adds to the malaise of poorly written disappointments that is permeated the MCU since Endgame. With one of the worst third acts of any movie in recent history. MODOK use and ""dick"" turn could be the dumbest thing I've ever seen and that's not even a spoiler. He also ended the movie as if they ran out of budget. What an absolute waste."
tt10954600,6.0,"Visually quite stunning with delightful and creative designs, shapes, and forms while the storyline is less than original without much in the way of intellectual or emotional, ethical depth of other recent Marvel movies. Apparently this movie was focused on being acceptable to a broad audience range, including young people, Quantumania loses some of its sharp refreshing focus. The created living entities of the quantum universe are more anthropomorphic (human-based) perhaps to be more relatable to children does not reflect the diversity or original forms of life or new-life that would really make this film stellar. As even as special as the set designs and special effects make for a gorgeous setting, there is still room for more crisp, detailed and immersive design work. Some backgrounds end up being mere basic animation projections that do not come up to the level expected of contemporary Marvel productions. Yes, this movie provides an amazing backdrop or canvas and yet the substance and plot of the movie does not rise to the same level. What one ends up with is a movie with a lot of flash but less than satisfactory bite."
tt10954600,6.0,"New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it."
tt10954600,6.0,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10."
tt10954600,6.0,"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off."
tt10954600,6.0,"I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short."
tt10954600,6.0,"As many others have pointed out we are now far from the heydays of peak MCU movies and this is just another reminder of that. The story is not horrible but nothing memorable. The actors are all good at what they do but the characters are uninspiring. The action and special effects still display the usual MCU level of polish but are not necessarily exciting. A better film critic than me could probably point out exactly what was the ""magic"" those movies had up until Endgame that is now completely lost. So as a fine piece of entertainment Quantumania does the trick but don't expect anything more than that."
tt1469304,6.0,"It's a warm, beautiful day on the beach. The pristine waves crash gently against the sand as the sun-kissed folk of Southern Florida come out to play. Lifeguard Post 1 stands like a sentinel - its windows permanently cocked forward towards the horizon. There's a change in the wind. A wind surfer looses control of his sail and is catapulted upward towards the sky before plummeting, head first into a coral reef. He's knocked unconscious...all seems lost. Then Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) appears on the scene.What results is a valiant rescue that inexplicably involves slow-motion running, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson flexing his pectorals underwater, fireworks and dolphins for some reason. The movie could have stopped right there as by that point we got the best version of what could have been the cinematic version of a far-fetched TV show. Unfortunately the first fifteen minutes aren't so much a harbinger of the hilarity to come but rather a visual metaphor for the movie's inflated sense of self.The film energetically sets up its main characters with all-too-brief introductions on tryout day. We immediately endear ourselves veterans Stephanie (Hadera), C.J. (Rohrbach) and Mitch as they judge incoming trainees the tough and brainy Summer (Daddario), the dorky Ronnie (Bass) and disgraced former Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (Efron) whose ego Mitch sees as a liability. Much of the film's prouder moments are spent with The Rock and Efron doing what they do best; The Rock deflating Brody's ego with real-deal charisma and action hero one-liners - Efron playing the dim-witted, put-upon jock who deserves everything he has coming to him because he was in High School Musical (2006).But just when you think everything will turn out for this movie, the narrative drastically shifts to a crime story that stops the movie's momentum cold. The narrative thrust involves the new owner of the beach's fancy yacht club (Chopra) and her suspicious connection to a new designer drug called Flaka. The rest of the movie doesn't so much spend time exploring that connection or its implications (Chopra compares herself favorably to a Bond villain pretty much from the get go) but instead it lays every aspect of the conspiracy out on the table and waits for the lifeguards to connect the dots.This ploy not only doesn't work but it basically splits Baywatch into two completely unsatisfying pieces. The first piece brings a diversity of comic set-pieces which on their own, probably couldn't make a good sketch on Key and Peele (2012-2015). They lack a depth of character requiring one or two of them to be more gullible, less resourceful or otherwise dumber than what was previously established.The other half of the movie plants its flag firmly on The Rock's ability to recap what we already know while Priyanka Chopra chews unhelpfully on the scenery until the timer runs out. All throughout the film drops hints that you should care about this or that - an insert shot of a watch brings more pause than a fiery boat rescue. Yet because nothing new is ever revealed, the film's call for attention becomes soporifically annoying.The overall tone of the film is also aggressively reductive, treating the, in retrospect quaint misogyny of the original series with an uncomfortable amount of contrarian glee. Every time one of the girls of Baywatch justifiably call out the boys for being pervs, the payoff by the end of the film amounts to nothing more than quid pro quo ribbing or worse - they end up with the dude at the end. If Baywatch had just treated the subject as window-dressing, I might have been inclined to let it go (after all trash TV is trash TV). Unfortunately the movie stops just short of waving its d**k in the air while saying ""you think we're being sexist, f**k you bruh!"" Thus I think its worth a brief mention.Baywatch has all the necessary ingredients to make a pretty satisfying comedic soup. Unfortunately apart from The Rock and Efron standing out as the film's sole saving graces, everything else is squandered on a useless story, oblivious editing and a unifying tone that's unnecessarily combative. Unless you're the type of person who truly believes Kelly Rohrbach's slo-mo runs along the beach are enough to maintain your attention, I suggest skipping out on this aggressively unfunny movie.On a related note: Stop with the dorky guy gets the hot girl for doing nothing cliché. It's been done a hundred times before, you're bringing nothing new to the table and it's come to the point where if you do it at all it just feels icky. The Sam Witwickys of the the world should have to, you know, work for it now."
tt1469304,5.0,"Baywatch... Based of the 1990s TV series starring David Hasselhoff, about lifeguards... with some bewbs in between... And now, it's a movie, starring The Rock... Now in theaters, in my country...Everyone already knows when your source material is ""this"", it was a recipe for disaster, and oh boy, it IS bad (but they know it!)Let's start with the acting. Literally all the main characters are great. Dwayne Johnson is likable as always. Zac Efron is also good in this movie. The bromance between The Rock and Efron is probably the best thing in this movie. Alexandra Daddario... from Percy Jackson to this, she really does improved and in this movie, she probably gave her best performance so far. What's surprising is the comic relief guy, played by Jon Bass. He's no annoying/trouble making guy, he's actually helping the team, which is great, well done writers. Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera is also great as C.J. and Steph respectively (although C.J. was overly sexualized, but that's pretty normal in this movie, obviously). Priyanka Chopra is way to good for this movie. I mean she could took something else rather than this. The cameos from Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson were also great.Everything else is... 70% garbage. The story is awful. So convoluted, so many plot holes. The pacing is uneven. The fight scenes were so disappointing. There so many quick​ cuts and close ups in the fight scenes, especially those involve The Rock. You don't need quick cuts and close ups for the fight scenes, you got a former wrestler in this movie! He definitely can fake fight scenes. The visual effects in this movie is a joke. There's not a single CGI looked convincing in this movie.Every scenes that should be intense is gone thanks to the easily noticeable CGI fires and CGI explosions. I was expecting more practical than CGI, but now I'm disappointed. (But again, they kinda know it! They know it's bad, so they kinda tried to be more bad that the original!)Let's talk about the humor. It didn't work, like 80% of it. They tried so hard to make you laugh, but most of the time, you'll be like: ""..."" The recurring jokes also gets annoying the more you've heard it. There's​ a lot of penis and bewbs, and most of them were so unnecessary. There's a conversation between Daddario and Efron in which Daddario kinda ""forced"" to bounce her bewbs (personal opinion btw). I mean: WHAT. (-_-) You don't needs bouncing bewbs and big balls all the time! Just give me a good movie that has a good story that is based from a really bad source material and I give this movie a immediate 9/10 stars. Seriously, are the writers writing an actual script for Baywatch, or a fan- fiction version of Baywatch? Because I'm pretty sure every 90 seconds in this movie would involve bewbs, or penises.Overall, this is definitely a bad movie that knows itself is a bad movie. It's the perfect disposable stupid fun movie. If you're a casual movie-goer like me, you'll have mixed feelings for this movie. For anyone else, skip this movie and watch Dunkirk or Apes 3 instead. But you'll probably enjoy this movie more if you're drunk (or if you dare, drunk while you're mind is ""flying"", then you'll woke up finding yourself leaving the world, or if not, you'll woke up in a rehab facility.)Final Score: 5/10. The acting is the only saving grace of this movie. And slomo bouncing bewbs.On a personal note: *SPOILER ALERT* How could a fat guy can get laid with a blonde sexy chick, while others don't? What logic is this? What kind of sorcery is this?"
tt4287320,6.0,"Robbie K back, after being off the grid for a week. Tonight's review is on the latest ""dystopian"" feature film called The Circle. Former Hermione Granger, and more recently Belle, Emma Watson leads the film as she attempts to take us into the workings of a technological conglomerate who has knowledge as its key principle. Yet the trailers paint a much darker secret hidden in its stony walls, one that promises to be a real nail biter. Will this movie deliver those thrills, or are we stuck with another wash out? I'll do my best to answer that question, so sit back, and please read my latest thoughts. LIKES: Nice tool development  Emma Watson  Culturally Relevant Film  Solid Moral LessonSummary: We all know technology is becoming the heart of the world, if not already the heart of this country. And certainly, we all know that these technological marvels often require laborious development and maintenance to get the bugs out. The Circle portrays this very well, helping to develop the very tool that we all love. Throughout the journey, you'll get to see the development of the two-faced beast that is technology, and how it requires tweaking to get just ""right"". Not the highest selling point for a movie, but pretty cool. Of course, we all know many are going to go for the lovely Ms. Watson, to support the super actress they adore. Good news, Watson does a solid job holding up most of the movie, as she is primary the only main character of the film. Watson brings her charm to the screen once more, portraying intelligence, fortitude and inspiration in a manner that many will latch on to. Her accent is pretty sound (though it fluctuates at times), but she manages to deliver her lines with a decent balance of emotion, to sell her points most of the time. Yet the biggest strength of these movies is how culturally relevant it is to the audience. If you didn't gleam it from the trailers, The Circle is essentially a modernized version of the novel 1984 that once more addresses the issues of control, life sharing, and privacy. The film is certainly very political, but has a number of powerful lessons to teach about the place of technology and how easily it can be twisted. I myself liked the comments from Emma's followers, a fantastic representation of the shallow, superficial, and often selfish focus that the internet provides. The scenes are well developed to deliver the full emotional punch, which while not the most unique, can really shock you to the core at how true it can be. DISLIKES:  Cheesy acting at times  Other actors diluted  Missed character development  Ignorant/Idiotic moments  Lack of SuspenseSummary: Despite Watson's strong performance, she is involved in some overly cheesy moments. On many of the emotionally heated moments, she loses her balance and stretches into the overdramatic region, losing her accent and dialogue forte in the process. But even her worst acting doesn't hold a candle to some of the supporting characters who give either emotionally dull deliveries or lackluster performances. These moments are noticeable enough to offset the momentum of the movie, and derailing it from the quality the trailers promised. An even worse quality for me was how the other actors of the star-studded cast were reduced to simplistic roles. Legends like Tom Hanks, Patton Oswalt and even the late Bill Paxton are reduced to very linear roles, with little character development or expansion beyond what you've seen in the trailer. With such a strong cast, I can't help but feel disappointed at the missed potential of this movie and how much this all-star cast could have done to amp up the quality of this movie. Even worse, some of the characters, primarily Emma Watson's character, become so blindly ignorant that the intelligence they worked so hard building is diluted to an idiotic level. As a result, I found myself starting to loathe the character and how 180 they took the character. Yes, I understand the premise behind the movie, but it didn't work for me. Other characters also fell into this mix as well, each built to have this incredible skill that was either not used or rapidly reversed to make the characters seem weak. Yet the most disappointing aspect of this movieis the lack of suspense. The trailer made this film out to be a mystery meeting dystopian policing. Not the case at all. The Circle has no mystery, laying all the facts on the table and leaving little to be uncovered. You would think there would be intense moments of espionage, or policing by superiors to build up excitement, right? Sorry, this film doesn't have that either, with the ""exciting climax"" not showing up until the last twenty minutes of the movie. As such, the movie is pretty dull and lacks the entertainment quality you might have been seeking. The VERDICT:The Circle is indeed a ""scary"" film, but it's mainly due to the reality check provides concerning the dangers technology can provide. This strong message is certainly the strongest aspect of the movie and Emma Watson was a fantastic choice to deliver it. Unfortunately, the weak characters, diluted roles, and lack of suspense took away from the entertainment quality of the movie. Such a dull delivery, leaves me recommending this one for renting at home, or at least recommending you read the book (or books) it is based on. My scores are:Drama/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0"
tt4287320,6.0,"I was a big fan of Dave Eggers' A Hologram for the King. It was a fantastic read for enjoyment and to analyze. The film adaptation also did not disappoint. When The Circle was announced as a film I immediately checked out the book. To my disappointment, the film wasn't as interesting an got to bogged down to its technological ventures and wasn't exactly the best read. However, I held out hope that the film would be able to impress, especially with the star studded cast at the helm.Emma Watson plays Mae Holland an ambitious young customer service rep who joins The Circle, a cutting edge technology based company that seems to be growing at fast pace and changing the future. The thing is, the technological leap of the company leads to massive privacy concerns and the company seems to be capable of more than what initially meets the eye. First off, I will say that the scathing reviews I've seen for the film are somewhat unwarranted, however the film is far from perfect and could have been much better.The plot may seem like its minimal or nonexistent but this wasn't really my concern. I was more concerned with things being introduced into the film that have no real importance later in the film. John Boyega's character is a glorified cameo that seems to just be there as a big name. In the book the character is mysterious has a much larger effect on Mae's life. The ending of the film leaves much more to be desired; there needed to be more explanation onto what the reveal was and anything about repercussions.The film is littered with talented people but unfortunately the writing and the structure of the film really lets them down. Its a misfire really, and the film needed to be much better and have a stronger central message. I feel like parts of the film and scenes were left on the cutting room floor. The film isn't exactly terrible but its most certainly unfulfilled and really could have left a stronger impression.6/10"
tt4287320,6.0,"Ironically I work for a tech company that if you really bent and twisted could look a little like The Circle only way less evil...I swear... The Circle seems incredibly timely and you know 30 years from now, even as campy as it ended up being, it could be considering a classic ahead of it's time simply because it has such a pertinent message to our world right now. It could be this generations social commentary. Unfortunately for this movie it is completely lost in very poor character development, some really horrid acting and line delivery, a weak and unedited script, a horrible use of star Tom Hanks and forcing Emma Watson to try and hide her British accent meaning she has not enough lines to give her character depth. Even still, for some reason I didn't hate the film. I still found enough about it that I liked. The idea and concept behind The Circle is very believable and the tech they use while it seems a little outlandish is incredibly real. If you stop and think about Facebook/Twitter/Amazon/The Cloud things that connect the entire world, this film is not even remotely far-fetched. I do believe Emma Watson has it in her to be a star. Fortunately for her Beauty and The Beast and it's 1B+ take will solidify her in Hollywood because it seems everything else she has tried falls flat. I don't think film makers are casting her correctly. She looks through this entire film like she is struggling with hiding her British accent. The dialog is really bad so it hurts her performance even worse. Still I like what they did with it, even if there wasn't enough time to really dig into her. Tom Hanks is the driving star power and is sorrowfully underused. Even still he comes onto screen and makes every scene he's in worthwhile. He's perfect as a low level villain of sorts who is more than close to real life. Ellar Coltrane might be one of the worst performances I've ever seen. Is this guy even an actor? As Watson's childhood best friend and sort of a focal point for Watson's development, he delivers his lines like a terrible Grade School actor. He is absolutely terrible and that is in addition to how bad the dialog is. His chemistry with Watson is literally non-existent. Glenne Headly, the late (amazing) Bill Paxton and Karen Gillan give the three best performances in the film. Paxton who plays Watson's father riddled with MS is fantastic! Similar to Hanks, Patton Oswalt is very underused as Hanks' partner in The Circle. He seems almost to have had his lines removed. And then you have John Boyega (you know the latest star of Star Wars) in an utterly pointless bizarre role where he stands in the back of rooms and looks broody. You would literally think they edited out huge portions of his character making it seem weird and disjointed.I'm not sure who is responsible for ruining a film with such amazing potential. I know that director and co-writer James Ponsoldt does not have enough experience to handle something of this potential calibre. I would presume that Dave Eggers original novel is much better and I feel like it's probably a lot of editing and cooks in the kitchen that killed this adaptation. I still liked a few performances, I loved the message and working in the tech world for me it really was a little on the scary side. It's worth seeing but probably forgettable but the message behind it will likely cause it to stand the test of time. 6.5/10"
tt4287320,6.0,"Director James Ponsoldt's The Circle depicts the story of a not-so-distant future, or perhaps an alternative present, in which one company dominates digital media, data gathering, and surveillance services. Based upon the four-year-old novel by author Dave Eggers, you'll notice some stark similarities between this motion picture narrative and the smash hit TV series Black Mirror. The biggest difference between the two is that The Circle is fast-faced and poorly written whereas Black Mirror is a slow-burning but well-written anthology series. In addition to the similarities between the aforementioned, there are certainly elements of The Truman Show in this movie as well. With a powerhouse cast, brilliant composer (Danny Elfman), and excellent editing, The Circle appears to have what a blockbuster needs; however, the hollow characters, poor character development, fractured subplots, and overall diegesis hold the film back from reaching the impact that it could have had. Having taken a digital media and privacy class in graduate school, and published a few articles, this is a film that I was looking forward to in order to analyze how the social commentary or commentary on the human condition regarding reasonable expectations of privacy and big data were integrated into the plot. Sadly, the screenplay was not strong or developed significantly enough to provide big data and privacy discussions.Mae Holland (Emma Watson) hates her job at the water company, so she is incredibly excited when her friend Annie (Karen Gillan) lands Mae an interview at The Circle, the world's most powerful technology and social media company. Mae's fear of unfulfilled potential impresses the recruiters at The Circle and she lands the opportunity of a lifetime. After Mae puts herself into harm's way but rescued, thanks to The Circle's newest surveillance and data gathering system, she is encouraged by the company founder Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) to take a more active role in technology development by participating in an experiment that puts Mae's life on display for the world (in the vein of The Truman Show) to see. Once Mae turns on that camera, she has more ""friends"" than she ever imagined and becomes an instant online celebrity. Unfortunately, this decision will affect those closest to Mae and the negative ramifications will reach far beyond her inner circle and begin to impact humanity at large. Sometimes, people just don't want to be found or be ""social.""For all The Circle has going for it, the weak screenplay keeps it from being the blockbuster that it so desperately wants to be. A great movie typically begins with solid writing, and that is what's missing here. After five minutes (or so it seems) of opening title logos, perhaps that is indirect evidence that there were just too many hands in the pot, each trying to take the movie's narrative in a different direction. Much like Frozen plays off like two different movies crudely sewn together, The Circle appears to be one movie for the first two acts, but takes an unexpected and unfulfilling turn in the third. A couple of conspicuous unanswered questions come after Mae meets TrueYou designer and founder Ty (John Boyega). He designed the platform that launched The Circle. At one point he asks Mae to meet him in a secret tunnel (where all the servers are stored) and tells her that ""it's worse than I thought."" Great opportunity to introduce intrigue, suspense, and more. The problem is that the audience is never told what Ty finds or what happens with what he found. You can remove that whole subplot and the movie remains the same. There are other subplots that are nicely introduced, but never carried out as well. Any or all of them can be removed and the film proceeds the same. Not good. If you can remove several subplots or unfulfilled turning points and the film's diegesis remain largely untouched, then you have poor writing. The third act in and of itself leaves audiences with a hurried ending that does little to provide closure to the narrative; however, it does support the film's circular logic and irony. Hardly satisfying.In terms of the allegory here, The Circle is a Google-like company with Apple's technology. Eamon Bailey is a Steve Jobs type innovator with characteristics of Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Eric Schmidt. Thankfully, The Circle does not represent any one company, but rather combines all the most notable innovations and technological achievements of Google, Apple, Facebook, Instagram, and more into one globally dominating company. Antitrust issues are introduced early on, but again, that's never fully developed. The movie highlights many issues faced by private citizens, governments, and digital data driven companies today; therefore, it sets the foundation for a movie that could have been thought-provoking, but the writing hinders that ability. The irony in the movie is for every digital answer to streamlining services or bolstering conveniences, a little privacy is eroded each time. Pretty soon, if one shares enough information, the idea of privacy is extinct. Privacy was central to the plot, but it just wasn't handled in the most effective way. Concepts such as ""off the grid,"" self-proclaimed ""celebrity,"" and ""calls to action"" are displayed and discussed in the film, connecting this augmented reality to real-world issues each of us encounter or think about. One particularly interesting theme in the movie is deep friendship. Unfortunately, this was not fully fleshed as is the case with most of the movie; but still, it does get touched upon.If you were hoping for another film like the brilliant Social Network, then you will undoubtedly be disappointed. Films such as The Circle should be memorable, but unfortunately this one is very much forgettable. Coincidentally, the movie itself is as hollow as the plot and characters.Written by R.L.

tt0418832,5.0,"Erotic, sexy and seductive, the hot project of softcore ""Lie With Me"" is not a complete triumph because there's a flawed plot that fails to convince the more experienced viewer. As a drama, there's some in's and out's but it's mostly out; as a softcore, it's ten times better than many of its genre because a) the cast is deeply involved with their nudity/sex scenes, and they're good looking to boot; b) the sequences are hot, nicely shot and those are the moments worthy of view. Eric Balfour is insanely hot, does a lot of full-frontal scenes (huge debate on the boards about...nevermind) and the words I need to describe him with accuracy cannot be used here. However, a movie that seems filled with a purpose shouldn't depend exclusively on the sex, no matter how intense and awesome those scenes are. That's why the thumbs down to this.Moving a little closer: Leila (Lauren Lee Smith) is a beautiful young woman with a relentless sex-drive going from one man to another in order to satisfy her sexual needs. It's all about being casual. One day, she meets the handsome David (Balfour) and things get very interesting. They both know what the other is all about, so they go forward with just one night stand that evolves to a few more days until it changes the whole game when...David falls for the girl. Back and forth between their involvement, we follow the lives those characters are leading, with David taking care of his sick father; and Leila's parents getting through a divorce - I think the film could go without those subplots, they're infinite sad. Gently touching you: the movie is told by Leila's perspective with her thoughts about losing herself through sex and all the effect it has on her. And that's why the movie focus on her doubt to make a decision: sticking by David and finally finding something new or going back to the arms of strangers. With a better script, this part would be fantastic. Now, I must push you away: The problem lies in the fact that it doesn't build anything deep that can actually provide that Leila and David are in fact, in love. They only had the basics with each other, what they knew the other could provide (sex) and somehow he's the one who cares so much about her without knowing her (but he tries!); and she's the one so scared about closeness, running away from him and later on going back to her hedonistic search for pleasure and not getting it anymore(the 'meltodwn masturbation' scene is real low and sad). To the writers (and most audiences, I'm afraid) this is a proof of love, building a relationship: a different touch, body to body and there you have it, love grows. I've seen this happen in life but it doesn't mean I truly trust it. Has to be more. Gotta be a little more cerebral, you have to know the inside behind the facade, the feelings, the vicissitudes of a person. Sex and intimacy is a big and wonderful step but it's just a step to several others; and sometimes you can even remove it from the equation and still have a meaningful love and understanding of the loved one.It's nice on the eyes but it's so simplistic, slightly mushy and in desperate need of a good dialogue scene. Where are the bloody words? Though I don't fancy much analogies and stuff, but I have to use one here. ""Lie With Me"" is like that dreamy hot person you fool around for a night, you two have a great time doing fun stuff in bed and whatever the place but when it comes to talking and sharing other experiences that doesn't revolve around intercourse, it's a big fat meh. Not a complete waste of time but you may feel a little disappointed afterwards. 5/10"

tt0418832,5.0,"This movie disappointed me a bit, as I expected a lot more when I saw the trailer. We cannot say it's totally disinteresting, because I think the main idea is good and quite original, but the way this movie was done is far from being great. It's too slow and dialogues hardly exist. At some moments it turns out boring In my opinion it pretends to be a complex movie and tries to mess up with ours heads when it totally changes the feelings which are supposed to exist in a relationship between two people just by sex, but it didn't achieve that goal, because it's too superficial at some crucial moments and characters aren't themselves too deep. There isn't really a plot, but a sequence of scenes, most of them sex scenes! But just sex is not enough to keep a relationship or even to make a movie (except if it is a porno), and sometimes this film seems to be just sex! Beside that, the entire ""story"" is too centered in the main character. From the beginning it seems we are seeing a monologue, a ""secret diary"", where she tells us her intimacy, her desires, her obsession about sex and, most important of all, her incapacity to love! But her ""secret diary"" is not made from wordssex is the only way to communicate! Once again, it's not enough"
tt0418832,5.0,"I liked the characters in this film and the actors playing them. But the truth is this film falls short in its effort to examine sex addiction vs. the complexity of love and relationships. I suppose it is easy to dismiss this work as a well produced soft porn flick. It seems to want to be much more. The problem is the characters are not all that well developed. We do not know what the two principal characters find in each other that will transcend their heavy breathing. They say they love each other eventually, but who knows why? Frankly I have know idea what the lead female character has to offer in terms of substance. At least the male character is seen reading Steppenwolf and not the cliff notes version, either. So I guess we can deduce he has depth and intelligence. The female lead, however, seems to work in photo developing shop as a clerk. Yet she has quite a varied wardrobe which she somehow is able to afford. That's about it in terms of her personality and depth. But they do have attractive bods and I must guiltily admit I enjoyed that. If the sex scenes were edited out, the theater would be empty half way through any screening!!!"

Her friend Rachel (Kristin Lehman) is giving up great sex to marry someone she loves. David starts stalking her and their perverse sexual affair grows. David is taking care of his father and Victoria is jealous.Firstly, this is not a late-night erotic B-movie. It's trying to be an artistic erotica with varying success. It has a hazy dreamy feel with soft colors and persistent narration from Leila. Leila is a compelling character for about 30 minutes before it grows tired. It becomes nothing more than two hot people having sex a lot. It's a lot of explicit nudity but the story moves way too slowly. Leila's deterioration could be much darker as well as the movie. This needs to be more than hot sex."

Maybe the scene is trying to say she is try to get away, find a new party scene and missing her boyfriend because they had a fight. scene 2 with the main male character washing his dad. Even thought there is nudity, the male lead was not really washing his dad, who just went for a #2? This scene was not authentic.The female lead did a good job, considering, her age, the script, especially well on the last few scenes.The after Q&A revealed that the movie added the parents and left out the female character's promiscuity before the boyfriend.

I have watched this over a dozen times and I don't care if some people refer to this as a ""chick flick"".A young girl falls in love with a boy from the other side of the tracks. Problems occur when his peers think the object of his desires is socially beneath him. Molly Ringwald was very good.

Don't write this off as just another teen movie. Highly recommended."
tt0091790,6.0,"""Pretty In Pink"" features a winning lead performance, but it's undermined by an awful supporting character that caused the film to be a muddle.The plot: in a socially divided high school, pretty but poor girl ""Andie"" (Molly Ringwald) falls for rich boy ""Blane"" (Andrew McCarthy) much to the consternation of her best friend ""Duckie"" (Jon Cryer) who wants to be more than just friends. Blane asks Andie to the prom. Andie is over-the-moon and Duckie is crestfallen. However, Blane gets cold-feet when his snake-in-the-grass ""friend,"" ""Steff"" (James Spader), tells him that Andie's low income status makes her an unfit girlfriend, but in reality he's just jealous because Andie rejected him. Spineless Blane wilts under the pressure and jilts Andie. Heartbroken yet defiant, she attends the prom by herself in a homemade pink dress.There she's met by her true Prince Charming and one whom she should have recognized as such long ago- Duckie. They join hands on the dance floor and kiss passionately turning their platonic relationship into a romantic one as OMD's ""If You Leave"" plays while the credits roll.Wait. That's not how ""Pretty in Pink"" ends! Well, that's how it was intended to end and how it was initially filmed. Yet, preview audiences hated that ending. They just could not abide Andie ending-up with Duckie. Panicked the studio ordered a redo of the ending. So, it was reshot on the fly with Andrew McCarthy wearing a wig because he had cut-off his ""Blane"" hairdo for another role. So, Blane quickly apologizes for being a gutless weasel, Andie quickly and inexplicably accepts that apology, and Duckie is quickly kicked into the friendzone presumably for good. That slap-dash ending just makes a muddle of the entire film, but still it's better than Andie ending-up with Duckie.What went wrong? Well, the character of Duckie went wrong. Poorly written, directed and acted. It was intended for the audience to go: ""Oh, poor Duckie! He's just so sweet, funny, and quirky. He's so nice to Andie and loves her so much. How could she not know?"" Yet, that's not how it worked in execution. Instead Duckie comes across as an obnoxious dweeb and one of the most of irritating and annoying in film history. An example: Duckie's extended lip-sync and dance sequence to Otis Reading's ""Try a Little Tenderness"" was supposed to make him endearing, but what audiences really wanted to do was to hit him with a shovel to make him stop that cringe-embarrassing scene. And when Duckie doesn't act like an obnoxious dweeb? Then he's a petulant jerk- a seething ball of envy and resentment who can't stand to see a friend happy if it doesn't involve him. He's Steff except without the Miami Vice wardrobe and James Spader's sneer. In 21st century parlance, Duckie is a ""Nice Guy."" Like many so-called ""Nice Guys,"" he isn't very nice. The creators failed to understand that just because Duckie was ""nice"" didn't mean he was entitled to Andie's romantic affections. That's why the character failed so miserably and why the original ending didn't work.As annoying and awful as Duckie is, ""Pretty in Pink"" does have some commendable stuff. First is Molly Ringwald. For a few years in the mid-80's, Miss Ringwald was America's sweetheart and this movie made at the pinnacle of that popularity shows why. Her Andie is endearing and quite fetching. The film features nice performances by Harry Dean Stanton as Andie's heartbroken dad and Annie Potts as her oh-so-quirky-but-oh-so-gorgeous boss. Also, James Spader was typecast for years as unctuous, back-stabbing creeps because of his memorable performance in this film. Plus, the whole 80's vibe of the film is quite nostalgic- ex: Andie works in a record shop!Writer John Hughes was apparently chastened by how ""Pretty in Pink"" had to do a reshoot. So, when he remade ""Pretty in Pink"" as ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" a year later, he made sure that the female version of Duckie in that film (Mary Stuart Masterson's character) wasn't so obnoxious that audiences would be repelled by her getting with her friend (Eric Stoltz in the Andie role) at film's end. Thus, ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" retains the ending that was intended for ""Pretty in Pink."""
tt0091790,5.0,"Writer John Hughes apparently reveres his childhood, in about the same way the makers of TV's ""Happy Days"" revered the 1950s. He has wrapped up his memories in plastic coating and taken care to make certain everything comes off COOL--even his leading character, a high school misfit, is very cool simply by having her rebuff the popular clique (a clique most teens would prefer to be in, rather than being tagged an 'outcast'). As played by Molly Ringwald, this high school unfortunate has her own phone, her own car, and her own job (in a fashionably retro record shop). ""Pretty In Pink"" is designed to make high school look good to junior high schoolers. It's Hughes' heaven for the have-nots (those who can afford it, anyway), where a misfit culture can make goofy glasses and thrift-shop attire something to LONG for. As a romantic teen-comedy, it stumbles by giving us insufferably smug Andrew McCarthy as Ringwald's dream guy (he's the type of actor who relaxes only when it's his close-up) and James Spader as the preppy villain (he looks so old, at first I thought he might be one of the teachers in ""Miami Vice"" dress). Ringwald is charming, and Jon Cryer takes a formula role as a goofy guy-pal and makes it something a little special (although it's a hand-me-down from Anthony Michael Hall). The film has some sincerity and a few witty lines, but basically it's pap (or rather, pablum) for audiences unwilling to chew, just swallow. ** from ****"

tt0089927,5.0,"The fourth Rocky movie retreats into a realm of fantasy that has to be seen to be disbelieved. It is by far the dumbest movie in the series, with a plot that defies credibility, and a closing boxing match that would surely prove fatal for both fighters if a contest like it were to take place in real life. What the film has in its favour is a sense of courage in its own absurdity. It's like everybody involved knows that they're working on something ludicrous, but they give it their all anyway  the actors, the cinematographer, the composer, the editor and the director all pull in the same direction, united in some kind of cheerful conviction that they can make an enjoyable movie from this silliest of premises.Life is good for boxing champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). He has a mansion, he has money, he has incredible public support and he has the all-important heavyweight champion of the world title. But news is spreading fast that there might be a better boxer on the face of the planet in the shape of Russian goliath Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). Drago comes to America for an exhibition match against Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), once Rocky's greatest adversary and now Rocky's greatest friend. The match is supposed to be a straightforward contest for Creed, giving him a chance to reassert himself as a top fighter, but it goes terribly wrong when Drago literally pulverises his opponent and kills him in the ring. Distraught at the death of his buddy, Rocky agrees to fight Drago. The venue: Moscow. The date: December 25th. In the middle of desolate northern Russia, Rocky trains for the fight of his life against a near-superhuman opponent. Not only is the honour of his dead friend at stake, but so is his life. not to mention the hopes of every man, woman and child from the free world! It seems kind of wrong for a Rocky movie to go all political on the audience, but Rocky IV indirectly does just that. Rocky's closing speech is a cringe-worthy plea for tolerance and change amongst the different societies of our world, and if I hadn't heard it with my own ears I would scarcely have believed anyone could put such infantile politics on film. The movie is much better when it concentrates on the sport aspects, especially the pulsating training sequences. With rapid-fire editing and rousing music, these parts of the film are quite inspirational and make you want to get out of your chair and put yourself through your paces in a gym as soon as possible! The final fight itself is a pretty exciting sequence but, given the fact that the film shows us that Drago has an impossibly strong punching-power, one finds it rather hard to believe that Rocky could still be standing after fifteen seconds let alone fifteen rounds. Rocky IV is totally unrealistic, totally simple-minded. and totally entertaining if you look upon it as a guilty pleasure!"

Along the way we have numerous sub plots involving Lucy trying to be a good mom, the Minions fed up with lack of crime and going to jail (it's never specified how that happens), Agnes (Nev Scharrel) wanting to find a unicorn after hearing a legend, Bratt wanting to destroy Hollywood in revenge for rejecting him as a teenager, and the relationship between Gru and Dru. In all honesty I think there's more plots than The Dark Knight Rises. This is really the biggest problem. A Despicable Me movie really doesn't need this many plot threads. Most of the time the movie just jumps around to each one and it comes off as being unfocused. Kids will probable be fine with it and it is enjoyable enough, but I don't think it's as good as the other three."
tt3469046,6.0,"While there are several interesting things going on at a rapid fire rate, there seems to be no real center to this thing. Even in an animated film, we want a story and characters that we recognize. The animation is awesome and I enjoyed the Mean Kid actor and his adult incarnation. I quickly became bored with the minions. They have no soul or interest to me."
tt3469046,6.0,"The first two 'Despicable Me' films were fantastic family fun, but, despite absolutely loving the scene-stealing minions 'Minions' was underwhelming (giving the sense, though in all fairness they were not well utilised in their own film, that the minions are better as supporting characters rather than leading).'Despicable Me 3' is a disappointment after the first two films but is better than 'Minions'. There is a lot to like about it, but it does feel very uneven and gives the sense that the 'Despicable Me' franchise has somewhat run its course. None of it reaches terrible depths though, just that the film could have been much better considering what came before it.Once again, the animation is wonderful. There are rich bright colours, lovingly and appealingly designed characters (nothing looks awkward like some of the human character designs in 'Minions'), meticulously detailed backgrounds and some real visual invention. 'Despicable Me 3' boasts a killer soundtrack that makes one nostalgic for the 80s (with Michael Jackson and Madonna), Heitor Pereira's score is suitably funky and Pharrell Williams' own contribution (especially the heartfelt and cute ""There's Something Special"") is note-worthy too.Some of the writing is witty, sharp and smart and there are some wildly funny and beautifully timed sight gags. One cannot say that 'Despicable Me 3' doesn't have any heart either, there are some sweet and touching moments here. The characters are likable, especially Gru and the minions (who once again steal scenes despite being underused somewhat), and the voice acting is excellent, Steve Carrell has still got it and proves that with good material and with a good character (like with Gru) he is a very talented comic actor (though he has shown a wider range than that too).However, other parts of the humour comes over in a scatter-shot way and suffer from a flabbiness and predictability. To me the villain was also a little bland, didn't find him particularly memorable or that much of a threat, and some of the soundtrack is compromised by the humour coming by so thick and fast that a few of the songs don't register or don't feel necessary.The most problematic aspects are the story and the pacing. The pacing occasionally is perfect but at some points it feels tired and at many other points it's almost too hyper-active and jumpy so a lot of the film feels rushed. The story suffers from being over-stuffed and bloated, it's basically three or four plots stuffed into one and not enough time is spent with either. The focus jumps around a lot with some of the transitions on the choppy side so the film and the story-line can feel disjointed.Overall, not a bad film at all but was expecting better considering how good the first two 'Despicable Me' films are. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
tt3469046,6.0,"Despicable Me 3 is another obligatory sequel to an animated box-office smash, and it plays out as such: the story's essentially the same as before but the big twist is that South Park co-creator Trey Parker stars in this movie as the lead villain. He does a good job with what he's given, but you wonder WHY he took up the part in the first place!? Was there any real motivation for him doing this besides the money? I think not.What can I say? It's perfectly harmless family entertainment that makes up for a very... 'because-movie' type of film. This pic gets 3/5 stars."
tt3469046,6.0,"Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) had been a child star portraying a lovable villain in the 80s. After losing his job, he decided to become a villain for real. Gru (Steve Carell) and Lucy (Kristen Wiig) stops Bratt from stealing the world's largest diamond. When the AVL change leadership, they get fired. The Minions abandon after Gru refused to revert to villainy. Gru is told that he has twin brother Dru who is a pig tycoon on the island nation of Freedonia. Dru reveals their late father's super villain persona and wants Gru to teach him the ways of a villain.I still like the characters despite this less-than-stellar outing. It's shocking that the movie without credits is no more than 80 minutes. This feels like a rushed job. I even like Bratt. If not for the love of these characters, I would consider this a failure. As a character, Dru holds some interesting promise. For that promise to be realised, he needs to turn evil. In fact, that should be the plot of this movie. Once Dru is introduced, that turn becomes fully expected and it should be executed sooner rather than later. Despite liking Bratt, I would prefer putting him in cold storage and first developing a better story for Dru. This is a misstep in franchise management."
tt3469046,6.0,"Back again, in this 3rd Despicable Me film Gru and Lucy get sacked by the Anti Villain League for failing to stop the largest diamond in the world being stolen by Balthazar Bratt (a child star of the 80's turned super villain). Gru learns of his long lost brother Dru, somebody that's worlds apart but still managed to be a super villain in his own right. Teaming up they attempt to get revenge on Balthazar, while Lucy and the girls have their own adventures. The minions end up in jail and have their own issues to deal with. Another fun film with all the voices you've come to know across the trilogy. It's got the same beauty as the first two films and manages to further the characters development. The plot is a little weak compared to the first films. For me it feels like the concept is getting a little tired now, it's a decent watch, but I didn't laugh as much, nor did I care as much as in the first two films. I was more amused at Balthazar Bratt and the 80's references than the main story, but that's because I'm a product of the 80's myself. Having done 3 movies now, 4 if you count the stand alone Minions film, I get the impression that the series is coming to an end. It's still watch this if it was on repeat sometime, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. 6 out of 10."
tt3469046,5.0,"As the 'Minions' movie demonstrated, too much of the adorable, pill- shaped, banana-obsessed creatures isn't necessarily a good thing; indeed, they were probably best in smaller and supporting doses, playing bumbling sidekicks alongside Gru as he went about his villainous, then anti-villainous, ways in 'Despicable Me' and 'Despicable Me 2' respectively. Unfortunately, they aren't given much, if anything, to do in this threequel, who as it turns out, are fed up of working for a good guy and decide to part ways with Gru early in the movie. That means they are here no better than occasional irreverent comic distractions, much like how Scrat was in the 'Ice Age' movies, notwithstanding a laugh-out-loud jailbreak sequence set to Pharrell Williams's hit 'Freedom'.And unfortunately, that sums up how 'Despicable Me 3' feels as well – always distracted, sometimes amusing, but never really engaging. It wants to be about the rivalry between Gru (Steve Carell) and all-new supervillain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), the latter a disgruntled former 80s child TV star who had fallen out of favour with the general public after hitting puberty and has since turned to a life of crime. It wants to be about Gru's new fellow super-agent wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig), who is trying to be a mother to his three adopted daughters – Margo, Edith and Agnes. It wants to be about Gru reconciling with his long-lost twin brother Dru, an empty-headed but successful pig farmer who yearns to follow in their father's footsteps of being a super-villain. Amidst all this, it also wants to be about Agnes and her longing to find a unicorn.No wonder then that the sweetness between Gru and his daughters from the earlier two movies is somewhat lost here. No wonder too that the Looney Tunes-esque gags seem to unfold at an almost breakneck pace, sacrificing wit and inventiveness for sheer visual spectacle. No wonder that it all feels drawn-out and overstuffed, cramming too many plot lines without ever developing any satisfactorily – except perhaps for the complicated sibling relationship between Gru and Dru, seeing as how the former tricks the latter into helping him break into Bratt's Rubik's Cube-like fortress perched at the tip of a pyramid. It is understandable how returning writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul had felt the need to up the ante with each subsequent instalment of the franchise, but like the 'Minions' spin off, less is sometimes a lot, a lot more.There are good bits though: Bratt, complete with shoulder pads, pump sneakers and 80s pop tunes of Michael Jackson, Van Halen, a-Ha and Madonna among others, is a hoot; so too the barrage of other 80s references, including Bratt's army of weaponised figurines christened 'Bratt Pack'. Carell and Wiig lose none of their verve reprising Gru/ Dru and Lucy, and Parker is a lively, dynamic addition to the ensemble voice cast – in particular as a substitute to Russell Brand, whose Dr. Nefario spends the movie frozen in carbonite. Co-directors Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda try their best-est to keep up the energy and enthusiasm from start to finish, and largely succeed in spite of a somewhat tedious detour on Dru's fictional European island in the middle act.Yet even on the same level of fun as its predecessors, 'Despicable Me 3' falls way short. We wish it were simply that what was once fresh has now become familiar; but oh no, the gags are nowhere near as funny nor as clever, and even the minions are starting to lose their subversive edge. Whether that is the cause or consequence of having too many things going on at the same time is anybody's guess, but the sum of some hilarious bits, some tedious ones and a lot of underdeveloped elements in between is a sporadically amusing affair that hardly lives up to the charm of the previous two chapters. When even kids below the age of five find their patience tested, it's as sure a sign as any that this franchise is fast turning yellow."
tt2083383,6.0,"""How the hell do you know I'm lucky to survive?""Legendary screen icon Clint Eastwood returns in front of the camera since his hit ""Gran Torino"". No matter what anyone else thinks of him, I will always admire the man. He is one of my heroes. Who else can personify the action hero perfectly, become a gifted filmmaker, improve his acting ability as he ages AND be quite the jazz musician?Mr. Eastwood may be old but he still has a commanding presence on screen. Granted, he might be the only leading octogenarian in Hollywood right now, but still, I digress. He is old. That is a fact. At the age of 82, seeing him play an elderly man losing his sight while bonding with his distant daughter makes it quite sad for me to watch. However, ""Trouble With the Curve"" is a breeze to watch.It is not a baseball movie, although baseball is the basis of the film's story. Nor is it a depressing drama (Mr. Eastwood's favorite genre of late). It is a father-daughter bonding dramedy, with some great chemistry between Mr. Eastwood and Amy Adams as his estranged daughter. Justin Timberlake also arrives to lighten up the atmosphere even more, and his presence is welcome in the film.Mr. Eastwood is not in the director's chair this time. His long-time producer partner, Robert Lorenz, makes his directorial debut with this film. Apparently Lorenz directs the cast with ease although it feels too by-the-numbers. But hey, there are much worse debuts. Judging from the breezy pace and the somewhat brisk editing and lively cinematography, it's clear from the get-go that the superb ""Eastwood touch"" is not evident in the film, even though some of Mr. Eastwood's key players are still here - cinematographer Tom Stern and editor Joel Cox - though the music by Marco Beltrami (not Mr. Eastwood nor his son this time!) complements the atmosphere pleasantly.Look, this is not a great film. It's a pedestrian and predictable film, with Mr. Eastwood, Adams, Timberlake, as well as an impressive supporting cast featuring John Goodman and Robert Patrick, phoning in the performances. Both Adams and Mr. Eastwood have acted much more superbly in better previous movies (""Gran Torino"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""The Fighter""). But it is funny, it is sad at times (Mr. Eastwood's heart-wrenching singing of 'You are My Sunshine' is forever embedded in my head), and it is easy on the eyes, ears and mind, a relaxing pleasure to watch. It is great entertainment. From all the big- budget blockbusters out in cinemas last summer, this is a joy. You'll walk out smiling.Overall: 70%"
tt2083383,5.0,"With the talents of Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, and John Goodman you would think you'd be in for a really good movie. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that was the case. It seemed the makers of the film went out of their way to make the film as contrived and formulaic as possible. With the various soap operaish plot elements and stilted dialog I was rolling my eyes in disbelief, especially in the final twenty minutes or so of the film.I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's movie work, but I thought that the concept of him being Amy Adams' father was really far fetched. Grandfather maybe. Adams, as usual, lights up the screen whenever she appears, with her vivaciousness and charisma. John Goodman does his usual solid job as the Braves Director of Scouting, and Eastwood's boss. He tries to help Eastwood and shield him from the young ""vultures"" who want to put Eastwood ""out to pasture"" once and for all. Matthew Lillard is believable as the top young ""vulture"" butt-kisser who has no respect for Eastwood and wants to enhance his own career.So with all this talent and what could have been a really decent story, why did the film makers have to take the predictable path at just about every turn? Oh well, just one man's opinion."
tt2083383,5.0,"Great cast but plot and direction are listless. Story just feels trite and predictable.Stand-out performance goes to Amy Adams. Clint Eastwood plays his usual curmudgeonly role, which is starting to feel a bit tired and predictable now. Good support from John Goodman. Justin Timberlake is Ok in his role."
tt2083383,5.0,"I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan, and I really like Amy Adams. Justin Timberlake was decent and a likable guy in this movie, so what's the problem? The problem is the story or should I say lack of a decent story. This movie is so predictable that 10 minutes into it you will be able to figure everything out including the ending. I don't understand why Clint Eastwood would accept or take on this role, maybe it's because he gets to be the crabby, hard headed, cigar smoking, never smiling, snarling old timer like he has played so well in previous good movies such as Gran Torino, Million dollar baby, and The unforgiven. Regardless of why he is in this predictable, silly waste of time, the bottom line is that this movie fails in every aspect. This is not a baseball movie, it's not a drama, it's not a romantic comedy, it's truly a waste of what might have been, could of been, or should of been a potential excellent trip into movie magic. I didn't hate this one, but I didn't like it either, I suspect the reason I didn't hate it is because I really do like Clint Eastwood movies and I'll forgive him this one slip."
tt2083383,5.0,"""Now get out of here before I have a heart attack trying to kill you."" That is my favorite line from the 80 something Clint Eastwood in this movie Trouble with the Curve. The movie is sport drama, that is kind of predictable and it does drag, that you can actually get up, go to the toilet get back and still not have missed anything. This is Eastwood's first acting role since 2008's Gran Torino and his first acting role in a movie where he is not the director since 1993's In the Line of Fire. The great thing about this movie is Clint Eastwood; his years of acting and directing made it easy for him to flow with the other actors, and making him the principal person to look out for when you do decide to watch this flick.The movie plot is about an old retiring baseball scout Gus (Clint Eastwood) who is about to finish up his contract in 3 months, Gus eyes are failing him and his old time friend Pete (John Goodman) calls up his daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) to keep an eye on her father.Mickey who is very busy, had to break away from her demanding work to go be with Gus and together they go scouting where they met Johnny (Justin Timberlake) a former player that Gus scouted out.Not much of a big fan of Timberlake's acting, his performance in In Time (2012) is the best I have seen him in till date, here is just a supporting actor running around being a pest. The love story or romance perpetuated in this movie is too shallow, if this is how easy it is to fall in love, then I will tie myself to my wife everywhere she goes. (Note: there was no adulterous act in the movie)The movie's high point will be the locations, the movie was filmed in various locations giving it the rich feel like you are traveling with a scout, and it does pull up the question of man vs machine, which will triumph. In the other baseball based sport drama Moneyball (2012) which starred Brad Pitt, machine seems to be the victor; here man seems to be the victor, so I guess the fight continues.Trouble with the Curve, shows why scouts are always needed to help scout out talents, there can see things that your computer can, while the computer runs on statistics and calibration, the eyes and ears rely on fact and observation. Trouble with the Curve is an OK drama, but you have not missed much if you haven't seen it.www.lagsreviews.com"
tt2083383,5.0,"Ageing baseball scout Gus (Clint Eastwood) doesn't believe in computers or statistics. He enjoys researching the old fashion way by going to games and watching new talent firsthand. However, Gus is struggling to take care of himself. He doesn't eat well and his eyesight is growing weaker, making it harder to observe the matches. With draft selections approaching, Gus's friend Pete (John Goodman) is worried about an important scouting trip coming up. He can't afford for Gus to make any mistakes with selections so he employs some extra help. He tries to persuade Mickey (Amy Adams), Gus's daughter, to go on the trip with her father. Mickey lives a very separate life to Gus. She works in a law firm surrounded by men and has to work hard for any recognition. However, she knows as much about baseball as Gus does and eventually concedes when she realises her father's instability. Her relationship with Gus shares a bitter past, but she finds relief by coming to know Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a young scout who would have been a great player had he not succumbed to injury. Trouble With the Curve is driven by a fantastic creative team, two experienced lead actors and a rising star - it's also nothing short of a misfire. The film is courtesy of Clint Eastwood's studio Malpaso Productions, but is directed by his assistant Robert Lorenz, the second unit director of films like Million Dollar Baby (2004) and Mystic River (2003). Positioning itself as a clear alternative to the sports science methods of Moneyball (2011), Malpaso is a fitting word. The name is derived from Malpaso Creek, which means ""bad step"" in Spanish. The script by first time screenwriter Randy Brown would have you believe that modern statistics in sports fall short of old school methods, like pure instincts and hands-on research. Did the old men that Billy Beane had to contend with come up with this? I don't know a lot about baseball, but after watching Rugby League for seven years I've learnt something: stats do not lie. A recent article in The Sydney Morning Herald described the fallout between the NRL (National Rugby League) administration and Sports Data, a company outsourced to organise all of the games stats and player statistics. Sports Data is said to hold a very close relationship with the games most successful coaches, many of whom use this information to prepare for matches as well as recruitment. The article also predicted that without these vital statistics, the 2013 season would start in chaos. Why would any other sport today, including baseball, be different? What's shown here, like listening to the sound of the bat, is an outdated and impractical fantasy, argued unpersuasively. The charisma of the film's leads adds a little more belief to the father-daughter side of the story. Amy Adams' form is first class, blistering with the same toughness and grit that Eastwood is best known for himself. They share great chemistry together and exchange some wonderfully comic verbal stoushes. She sarcastically says at one point in the film: ""It must be so rewarding being one of your close friends"". Although Eastwood is starting to look weary, he can still throw down the odd good line or two, like when he comments that his garage is shrinking after scratching his car. There are also a couple of scenes where his own sense of invulnerability, coupled with his ailing eyesight, provides some briefly tense moments. Yet it's the script that lets the actors down again because it doesn't know how to develop the central relationship. Gus and Mickey fight, watch baseball together, and fight some more, right until an unmoving revelation is tacked on at the end. The lack of drama is compounded by Timberlake's character. He's very charming and funny, but if Gus is unconcerned about Johnny romancing his daughter, where's the tension? Mickey's relationship with Johnny itself is also very old fashioned and overly safe. He's laid-back, she's not, and they discover they both love baseball and go swimming in a lake together. Jumping in that ice-cold water is about as radical as this film ever becomes. With an overdose of pleasantness and few dramatic high points, the film becomes tedious viewing. Nonetheless, it won't tarnish Clint's legacy too much: it'll be forgotten before then."
tt1104001,6.0,"Right off the bat I'm going to say that I didn't see the first film. Obviously I've heard from a lot of people saying that they need to see the first film before watching this one, seeing as this is a direct sequel to a nearly 30 year old cult sci-fi film. But, seeing that I didn't have time, I decided to watch the sequel anyway.Now keep in mind that Disney took a HUGE risk in making a sequel to a movie that is not very often talked about when it comes to movies as opposed to many blockbusters today. The first TRON had no famous franchise to speak of (apart from the real games inspired by it). Adding to the danger is the film's budget - reportedly between US$ 200 - 300 million. With that kind of money you'll wonder what exactly was Disney hoping for with this film.Nevermind the fact that the story is a bit unfocused and could be rounded up in a more polished way. Nevermind too that the fantastic world and great ideas aren't expanded upon some more, as well as the fact that the script could use a little bit more originality.Also, not forgetting some good (in Jeff Bridges' case, great as always as he plays two very different characters with perfect emotional resonance - proving that he still has the chops to carry a big movie) performances by the cast - with Garrett Hedlund showing great leading man potential and Olivia Wilde looking great and cute to boot. Michael Sheen, Beau Garrett and Bruce Boxleitner (apparently returning to his role from the first film, so it seems) all give good support.No sir-ee, what you pay for - and what you get in spades - are the special/visual effects. Goodness me, this is quite possibly the best special effects I've seen all year, and that's saying something. I have to admit though, the CGI that makes Jeff Bridges young look jarring, but that is overshadowed by the compelling, groundbreaking special/visual effects that really bring you into the cybernetic world. Who doesn't want to take a ride on one of those fantastic, futuristic vehicles? Who doesn't want those awesome light-cycles or one of those dueling/data discs? It is possible that, like ""Avatar"" a year ago, this film can be a game-changer for special/visual effects alone.It's a real treat for the eyes, and it's even better in 3D which is splendidly used to flesh out the dimensions and graphics of the cyber world bring you even deeper into the world instead of things merely flying out to you and post-production conversion like in SO many 3D movies (Note that in the 3D version, there's a disclaimer before the film starts, saying that parts of the film are filmed in both natural 2D and 3D as they way they should be. Just so you know, this shows that the filmmakers care for what they want to give you).Very ambitious architect-and-designer-turned-first-time-filmmaker Joseph Kosinski hit a home run with this film, crafting an extraordinary and spellbinding world of escapism that looks slick, stylish and extremely cool to watch. Kosinski and the production team fill the cyber world with heaps of imagination and the result is what you see on screen. And here I thought Hollywood would recycle certain design patterns (plot patterns still need work though). Kosinski is a truly visionary filmmaker that one really has to keep an eye on.The production design is on par with the special effects, it is nothing short of spectacular and perfect. The cinematography which is big and wide and best of all NOT shaky allows you to savor every moment of SFX goodness. The superb sound effects serve to complement the visuals and the electronic world, and all for the better. Daft Punk's varying but atmospheric electronic/orchestral score all but suits the film's mood perfectly with its techno beats and soaring string during moments.Overall, this is perhaps a fine way to end the blockbuster season of 2010, and this is a definite must watch for all looking for an escape. The special effects alone are worth the price of TWO movie tickets, and with that I say, give this one a try, even if you haven't seen the first one. It aims to entertain and to dazzle the audience, and it succeeds brilliantly. Excuse me while I rent the first one now.Overall rating: 75/100"
tt1104001,6.0,"I wouldn't call myself a TRON hardcore fan - I couldn't even crack a single message from their website during their ""Flynn lives"" viral campaign. Still, I know the movie perfectly well - I watched it on a movie theater when I was 8 years old, and I simply could never get out of my head the Recognizers and Lightcycles. I did master the Intellivision Tron Deadly Discs game, and the movie jump-started my love for all things computer related. I've watched the 20th Anniversary DVD and all the extras far more times than I can care to count. Guess I'm a TRON hardcore fan after all.I had mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, a sequel to TRON made all the sense in the world - the original movie correctly predicted plenty of concepts that we now take as granted (the importance of a network, transports, I/O ports, security, etc.), so a sequel could do something similar. The script could basically write itself; back then, writers had one very difficult time trying to convey the inner workings of a computer network to an audience that was not as computer saavy as today (I'd say they sort of failed - TRON's weakest part was its story). Also, Disney couldn't just hire everyone; they weren't the powerhouse they are now, so they had to do with a scrappy team of visionary but amateurish people. Now, with $300 million dollars at their disposal, any actor they could ever want, all the technology they could ever need, Pixar and their creative team, how could Disney make Tron a failure?If you want an answer to this question, just go watch Tron: Legacy. It IS a failure.Why? I believe that TRON, as näive and silly as it sometimes is, has its heart in the right place - it always strives to tell a story, and uses technology as both a backdrop and a principal character. It's not technology for its own sake, either - the Lightcycles, tanks, recognizers, and the complete universe of Tron really made you feel as if you were somewhere else. It was completely unlike anything you had ever seen before. The art depicted on the movie was so striking I think it'll be remembered for years to come just because of it. And, as I said before, it correctly guessed at the future of computing. I wouldn't hesitate to call it a landmark movie, even considering all of its problems.Tron: Legacy is just another product Disney marketing decided to sell. It has no soul whatsoever. It's not innovative or inventive - most of the things you'll see come from other, more successful movies. Examples? The aerial pursuit near the end of the movie is lifted directly from Star Wars. The bar scene is a near perfect copy of the one on Matrix: Reloaded. The attack scenes are also lifted from the Matrix. Jeff Bridges is The Dude in a cybercostume. The rebel kid hacking computers seems like a copy of Terminator 2. At no time did I think to myself ""this is something I had never seen in my life"", as I did with Tron.Furthermore, there's no story of any importance whatsoever behind all the CGI. The original TRON dealt with issues we face nowadays in any computer network (well, at least if you are a geek and work with computers). Tron Legacy doesn't even make any effort to predict the future, or to point out at any risks technology poses to people in the XXIst century. It's a completely disposable product, which is sort of enjoyable when you watch it, but can't bear to think about it afterwards. Because it really makes no sense and it doesn't make any important points.I cannot believe Disney couldn't get someone - anyone - capable of writing a good script, hiring decent actors (Sam Flynn was TERRIBLE) and getting a director with at least a couple of good movies under his belt. The only reason why I give this movie a 7 is because, even though you've seen everything before, it does look great on the big screen. I especially liked CLU - I never noticed I was looking at CGI. Awesome technology.I'm completely positive this sequel will go down in history as others, such as Blues Brothers 2000, the Star Wars prequels, and Matrix: Revolutions as one of the worst ever made. Sad. It had so much potential it's incredible they actually blew it."
tt1104001,5.0,"WARNING: SPOILERS *****************Visually, a feast, but a leisurely script leads to a muddled climax. A fan of the original since 1983, I had been looking forward to this for a long time. The trailers & stills looked very promising. Sadly, while it looks good, some questionable decisions have been made, and the film doesn't seem to know what to do or where to go.Some of the original concepts seem to have been dumbed down for audience acceptance. Programs, formerly living a uniquely digital lifestyle, sipping energy from pools, worshiping users, are now just like regular dudes with funny clothes. They work, sleep, eat, drink, and go to clubs. Perhaps this dumbing down is why this film poses more questions than it answers. Why has the digital world taken on analogue characteristics like dust, atmosphere & functionless water? Why do the digital Recognizers, previously smooth, humming machine menaces, now have exhaust flames & jet engine noise?Why do light cycles sound like they have gasoline engines? How can a totalitarian digital society have ""homeless"" programs (who drink from brown paper bags yet)? Why do all the programs now leap around and pose exactly like Asian martial artists? Just, why?? How were the Isomorphic algorithms going to change the world? How was CLU going to conquer the world with a bunch of computer programs who were good at throwing disks?When young Flynn switched off the server, was the world destroyed? (if so, shouldn't he have waited, since (a) the threat had been stopped, and (b) in case there were still some of those useful ISOs surviving, especially since he (and the audience) have no clue as to how to use them?) If hours in the digital world were minutes in the real one, and in the real world it's been 20 years, does that mean that old Flynn had been trapped for up to 1200 years? (which might explain why he's channeling The Dude from ""The Big Lebowski"")The biggest disappointment for me was the almost complete absence of the title character. By the end of the film, I still wasn't sure where Tron was. I had to read some summaries on the Internet to find out.I would have preferred it if Tron, in his last act, saved the day. Sadly, when he did (briefly) appear, he was ineffective and pointless.I was a fan of the original Tron. Original ideas and logic have been dropped for populism & eye candy.

tt11245972,5.0,"Of course I have seen the previous ""Scream"" movies way before I sat down to watch the 2022 movie ""Scream"" from writers James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick. But I have to be honest, I haven't been much of a fan of the ""Scream"" franchise, though I have seen the movie on the account of it being horror movies. So I wasn't really harboring much of any expectations to the 2022 movie.And with good cause, because directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett didn't really deliver anything that haven't been seen previously in the numerous ""Scream"" movies. Sure, there were new characters in the storyline, but essentially it was just the same old soup boiled on flavorless bones. So if you have seen the previous movies, you have essentially already seen the 2022 movie ""Scream"" as well. But chances are, that if you are a fan of the franchise, then you certainly will find some greater enjoyment in this 2022 addition to the franchise than I did.The storyline, while it certainly was watchable, just was too mundane and generic. And it was essentially just the same routine done again, but with new faces. Oh, and with some recurring faces too to reprise the 'legacy' characters, as they were called in the movie.For a horror movie, then the 2022 movie ""Scream"" just wasn't outstanding, and it is a movie that quickly will fade from my memory now that I have seen it. But then again, this wasn't a movie that I was particularly looking forward to getting to watch.The acting performances in the movie were good, and that goes for both the new cast and the former ""Scream"" stars returning to reprise their characters. I will say that it was most certainly David Arquette that put on the most memorably performance in this movie.Sure, the 2022 ""Scream"" movie caters to the fans of the franchise. But for us casual viewers that have seen the previous movies or at least have familiarity with the franchise, then this 2022 movie was just sort of mundane. I am sure that if you are new to the franchise, then the 2022 movie ""Scream"" is a good movie.I have to say that, for me personally, then ""Scream"" felt like a fully and wholly unnecessary movie.My rating of ""Scream"" lands on a mediocre five out of ten stars."
tt11245972,6.0,"After watching Scream 2022 (Scream 5), I'm confused as to how critics and fans are rating this film a 9 or 10 out of 10. The 1st and 2nd act worked well, the 3rd act ruined it. The conclusion felt random and unearned. Certain intentions made no sense. I also didn't appreciate the writers pretty much asking the viewers to suspend logic while watching. Whoever is placing this entry into the #2 or #3 spot of the franchise is living in La La Land.That said, this movie opens itself up to an interesting 6th sequel if written well. Bring Kevin Williamson back to write the entire script. Bring in some more humor. Surprise me with something original."
tt0120646,5.0,"This movie is so famous, and has so many great actors in it, that I had expected more from it. As it was, it had some heart-warming moments, handsome people and beautiful exteriors and interiors - but all in all it was not very exciting. The story was the kind of sentimental family drama one would expect on Hallmark television in the afternoon - not a big cinema movie with famous stars.By the way, I think it is not possible to place a lost-and-found kid drama in present times, because DNA technique, finger prints etc. can prove the identity with almost hundred per cent's certainty. The interesting thing in the lost-and-found stories, is to guess if the person found is who he/she claims to be, or an impostor. As in ""Anastasia"".And YES I understand that this kind of mystery was not the major issue here, but the reactions of all the family members afterwards. But it is that kind of story that one expects, when one reads about this movie or watches the trailer. So - it was a bit of a disappointment."

Pfeiffer delivers one of his strongest, most deeply passionate performances as the emotionally torn mother of the missing child and she is complimented by Williams (his best in years), Jackson as a troublesome elder son and Goldberg, in a pivotal role as the detective who helps find the family's boy. The pacing is just right and the performances make you grab for the tissues at the pleasant ending."

She recognizes Sam as her long lost son Ben. It's discovered that Ben was kidnapped by a disturbed woman who has since committed suicide. His new father didn't know about the kidnapping. Ben is reunited with the Cappadoras but life with the family is problematic. Ben wants to go home. His brother Vincent is rebelling. Beth and her husband Pat (Treat Williams) are cracking under the pressure.Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams are both great. Cory Buck as young Vincent does an admirable job. Jonathan Jackson and Ryan Merriman are in a tough situation as the older versions of the sons. So much is expected but they aren't given the tools. This movie tries very hard to get emotional truths but it only gets glimpses. There is so much ground to cover. It would have been better to concentrate mostly after the reunion. Losing Ben is too alluring and takes up half of the movie. The first half is effective and traditional. The second half feels thin and more original. The movie feels split between the two."
tt0120646,6.0,"Noble, decent film about a crises in suburbia: a boy, kidnapped nine years ago from a nice, normal family, is returned to them--a virtual stranger. This premise was done great justice in the grittier TV-film, ""I Know My First Name Is Steven"". This theatrical drama has fabulous, full-throttle performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams as the parents, some interesting plot turns, but nowhere to go after the boy comes home. We've seen it all before--even Whoopi Goldberg as a detective seems shoehorned in from somewhere else (it's virtually the same character she portrayed in ""The Player""). I would forgive the film for its assembly-line construction were it not for a downright drippy finale. Sure, it wouldn't have been as uplifting had the film ended a different way (turning on the kid's decision), but why do we always need to be uplifted at the movies? Is there some Hollywood legend that says all downbeat endings result in flop films? Well, this one did flop, so there's a double excuse not to end the thing with everyone leaking happy tears in the driveway. **1/2 from ****"
tt0120646,5.0,"The trailers for this looked really good. As it happens they turned out to be the only engaging parts of an otherwise forgettable film as a whole.The premise behind the movie is an extremely tense and emotional one, but the script and directing let things lag to the point where you realize that this is TV fodder. I half expect to see (better) versions of the same thing on Lifetime TV on some derary Sunday afternoon. What's so confusing is how Pfeiffer and some other apparently great actors wound up in it."

The search doesn't yield any results. And so, the family has to deal with this sudden loss: Beth develops a serious case of depression, her husband, Pat (Treat Williams), tries to hide his grief and move forward, and their oldest son, Vince (Jonathan Jackson), has to deal with both his guilt (he was supposed to be watching his brother) and the lack of attention from his parents.Almost a decade later, the family moves to a new neighborhood. A boy comes by and asks if he can mow their lawn – and instantly, Beth recognizes her son, Ben. Will the family be reunited after nine years? And is it even possible to make up for the lost time? The Deep End of the Ocean has quite a few things going for it: a solid cast and, more importantly, an intriguing premise. What a pity that it doesn't make more of it.The most glaring problem is that the makers aren't sure what kind of story they want to tell. Is this a movie about the loss of a son? Is it about a family's reunion or about the problems afterwards? Or is it about the impossibility of changing the past? Instead of choosing, the movie tries to tell a variety of different stories, and that doesn't quite work out. In the end, the different parts seem too disjointed.A second problem is the partially incomprehensible motivations of the characters. In one case in particular, this is due to a bad child actor. Ben's (Ryan Merriman) displayed emotions don't seem to fit his actions even once.The Deep End of the Ocean could have been a pretty good Lifetime movie. Instead, it was turned into a below-average motion picture.Written by: Johanna Schoenfeldhttp://thecelebritycafe.com/movies/full_review/12945.html"
tt0120646,5.0,"Directed by Ulu Grosbard, ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" stars Michelle Pfeiffer as Beth, a young mother whose son Ben mysteriously disappears. Nine years later Beth finds Ben living with another family, with whom he's formed familial attachments.""Ocean"" boasts an interesting narrative structure. Its opening scenes sketch a ridiculously cheerful suburban idyll. Such idealisations are shattered when Beth's son goes missing. Henceforth Beth becomes suicidally depressed. Her domestic fantasies are rekindled when Ben returns. Henceforth Beth sets about (re)creating what is essentially a simulation: a facsimile of what she thinks the ""perfect American nuclear family"" should be like (or would have been). The film's big irony is that this facsimile, the very idealizations which bring Beth out of her depression, promptly forces her newfound son into depression; the kid misses his surrogate family, a family which his biological mom deems ""fake"" but which is nevertheless ""real"" to Ben.""Ocean"" has fleeting moments of truth. Some scenes between mother and son, and between brother and brother, are genuinely powerful. The film also works well when touching upon the ways in which happiness oft depends upon shared delusions, and the ways in which what we deem to be ""true love"" and ""true familial bonds"" are subject to arbitrary social/environmental coding. Actress Whoopi Goldberg is also interesting as a lesbian police officer.Unfortunately, much of ""Ocean"" is also unbearable. This is a formulaic and safe film which too hastily rushes through its plot points and which becomes increasingly incredulous as it progresses. The way in which Beth ejects Ben's ""surrogate"" family from his life is also frustratingly tactless. Designed to whip up easy drama, this is a narrative gimmick found in many similar movies of the era, most of which saw families unnecessarily fighting over cute kids. Based on a novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard.7/10 - See ""Birth (2004), ""Like Dandelion Dust"" and ""Shadow of a Doubt""."

But he already has a family that he knows and loves.""Deep End of the Ocean"" examines these tough issues, the impact the actions of the mother and father have on each of the other family members.

tt0758752,6.0,"Love stories are essentially the same -- it's a matter of how you dress  them up. Many will see through ""Love and Other Drugs"" and count the  romance clichés and formulaic characters, others will find the 1996  setting and the pharmaceutical angle refreshing. Both forces are hard  at work in this film, but the tipping point goes in favor thanks to the  leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway.  There's a reason most romantic films are judged based on the chemistry  of their lead actors. When it comes to romance, it's not about how  cleverly written the two characters are and how unique and special they  feel to us. What counts is whether they can convince you of their  attraction/love and get you to -- without blunt coercion -- invest in  what happens to them. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have what it takes to do  just that in spite of a script that sometimes tries to lean too hard on  conventional tactics of boys meets girl.  Gyllenhaal plays Jamie, an expert salesman who lands a gig as a  pharmaceutical sales rep for Pfizer, right before Viagra hit the  market. He's also adept at landing any woman he desires. He epitomizes  a Don Juan and he's plays the type well, but when you can predict that  he'll end up in bed with the next attractive woman that shows up on  screen, the writing has taken it a bit far.   As good of a filmmaker as Edward Zwick is, his best credits include  ""Glory,"" ""The Last Samurai"" and ""The Blood Diamond"" -- not exactly  romance. He co-wrote the script (based on Jamie Reidy's memoir) with  longtime collaborator Marshall Herskovitz and thriller writer Charles  Randolph (""The Interpreter""), so no real romantic comedy prowess exists  among them, hence the tendency to stick with genre conventions. One  such convention is Jamie's brother (Josh Gad), who plays the little  brother crashing on Jamie's couch who has a porn addiction and makes  clueless statements, usually to the tune of no laughs, but he does help  break the tension.  Enter girl. Jamie meets Maggie, a bit of a free-spirited cynic who (in  a unique twist) has way early onset Parkinson's. Many will be quick to  jump on the ""diseased girl"" archetype, but don't judge Hathaway's  prowess that quickly. As completely pathetic as Maggie's self-esteem  might be and how strictly anti-commitment she is, when her character  caves in to the romance as they all do, Hathaway gives Maggie a  believable fragility rather than a melodramatic tone.   Jamie's motives for wanting to spend more time with Maggie and not  simply continuing his streak of banging all who possess lady parts are  reduced to the reason of ""she's playing hard to get,"" which is not the  best of reasons. The same can be said about Maggie constantly accusing  Jamie of having pity sex with the diseased girl. However, watching  these two charm each other and overcome the cliché has a definite  appeal.  The two spend a lot of naked time together, making ""Love and Other  Drugs"" the best date movie this holiday season. But on a serious note,  the drug angle and the ""recent past"" setting give us something else to  chew on, which is nice. Zwick never truly marries that story line with  the romance except ""Jamie sells drugs and Maggie has a disease that  lacks an effective one."" The thematic ties are not quite there despite  the plot coincidences and the fitting title.  ""Love and Other Drugs"" is hardly the cure for the common romantic  comedy, but the consistent dosage of its two stars by and large pushes  away those symptoms.  ~Steven C"
tt0758752,6.0,"Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a womanizing stereo salesman who got fired for sleeping with the bosses' girl. He's the black sheep of a successful family, and turns to selling pharma for Pfizer in 90s Pittsburgh. During a visit to a doctor, he meets Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway) who is suffering from early onset Parkinson's.The backdrop of pharmaceutical sales may not be the best for a comedy. There are attempts at jokes especially some Viagra montages, but it's more eye opening than funny. Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor who is trying to give humanity to this relatively unlikeable guy. Anne Hathaway adds on a layer of cynicism and anger. It's not an easy silly rom-com. Although I try to like this movie, the tone changes are just too difficult to take."
tt0758752,6.0,"If you're familiar with the names of writers/producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick from their TV output of ""Thirtysomething"", ""My So-Called Life"", ""Relativity"", and ""Once and Again"", you may know their reputation of creating characters that are complex and therefore not always likable enough to completely relate. That's the case with this movie that they're also responsible for. Basically, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a drug executive who's always been good with the ladies at least until he meets a patient played by Anne Hathaway who sees right through him. I'll just stop there and just say how nice to see these veterans of Brokeback Mountain have more of each other to play against compared to the previous film's story-dictating of some separations. And despite some character flaws, the characters they play do have some remarkable good chemistry due to both the actors and some of the script/improvisations. But despite some good laughs, Herskovitz-Zwick do provide some rough edges that almost threaten to cast some pall over the proceedings. Still, having said all that, Love and Other Drugs is a worthy adult dramady for all involved though I do have one real caveat: Why put George Segal and the recently departed Jill Clayburgh here and just have them have one dinner table sequence where neither gets to really show their stuff?"
tt0758752,6.0,"""Love & Other Drugs"" is another example of how Anne Hathaway is one of the most talented actresses from her generation. She managed to score a Golden Globe nomination just like her co-star Jake Gyllenhaal. I have to say I am not his greatest fan, so I was neither too impressed with his performance here nor did I manage to find him likable near the end which was probably the intention. He was just too unlikeable early on. The movie is directed by Edward Zwick, an Oscar-winning producer for ""Shakespeare in Love"".First of all, I want to say that the happy ending felt a bit forced in my opinion that they just had to close it with the two reuniting and it was a bit random. And didn't she say before she had somebody else already? Where did he go? Why did Gyllenhaal's character leave her anyway if he loved her? The whole split-up scene came totally out of nowhere only minutes after they confessed each other that they are in love. Anyway, Hathaway's enthusiastic behavior after the Parkinson convention was great to watch and she really nailed that scene. The entire convention and monologues were written nicely. What I did not like about the film has mostly to do with Gyllenhaal's character. His brother was brought in for some comic relief, but added really nothing else. The final boner scenes were downright bad and brought some terrible ""American Pie"" humor to a film where it did not fit at all. Also, the whole medicine background story in the first half of the film was just not developed at all. That one scene when they talked about the impact of the medical industry at that point and included a reference to a presidential candidate was downright bad. All of a sudden, the movie seemed politically ambitious and it did not work out at all. The movie worked best as a somewhat different, more serious romantic comedy between the two protagonists.The film succeeds occasionally on an emotional level, for example when the older man tells Gyllenhaal's character to leave her and not go through all the struggles due to the illness. Another one would be when Gyllenhaal's character watches the video of his ex-girlfriend near the end. Gave me goosebumps. As a whole, the movie has some great scenes, some pretty weak scenes, but as a whole I'd recommend it, especially if you like one of the two main actors. Lots of graphic nudity too, so stay away if you're a bit on the prudish side."
tt0758752,5.0,"Ladies man Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a super smooth talker working in an appliance store. When he is fired for having sex with a co-worker he is pressured to find a new profession. His brother, a lazy overweight computer geek, has already made a fortune selling computer software to pharmaceutical companies. As such, Jamie uses his charming persona to become a sales representative for a drug company, working to sell drugs to local doctors and GP's. It's a cutthroat business, but he still manages to work his way around people. He meets his match when he meets Maggie (Anne Hathaway), a slightly neurotic artist who initially holds him in contempt but then grows to appreciate his fleeting nature. She is only interested in casual sex but slowly Jaime becomes more attached and more concerned about her wellbeing.Love and Other Drugs was adapted from the book ""Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" by director Edward Zwick. With Marshall Herskovitz and Charles Randolph, he also wrote the screenplay too. It seems like an oddity for Zwick who has mostly specialised in action films like The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond and Defiance. His lack of familiarity with the romantic comedy genre is most evident with the jarring changes of tone of this film. It starts off as a quirky comedy but there's also a distinct lack of wit in the screenplay. Jamie's supposed charm and suave is so overdone and phoney that is difficult to believe that any of the women in the film could fall for it. Annoyingly, they do repeatedly. The intrusion of Jamie's overweight brother, the typical fat character employed for comic relief, is a superfluous addition too that adds little to the narrative. In the second half, the film is nearly two hours, the story attempts to change gears to become a medical melodrama, as Maggie's illness deteriorates. At this point the film seems to becoming more thoughtful and smarter than the typical Hollywood romantic comedy since Jaime has to find a balance between his work and looking after her. However, it's undone by an extremely safe and predictable conclusion, complete with the kind of mawkish speech that only a romantic comedy could provide. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway have worked previously together in the film Brokeback Mountain. Gyllenhaal though is an unusual choice for what this particular role demands. He seems miscast because his smoothness and supposed suave is so artificial. He overplays it entirely in the opening scene. His choice of stealing drugs from rival companies seems like an incredibly unlikely practice. After he transforms into the typical nice guy in the latter portion of the film his character becomes bland, rather than sincere. This is more the fault of the screenplay as the inner life of his character is particular uninteresting. The only particularly memorable aspect about his character is that he never managed to finish medical school. Hathaway is rather spiteful as Maggie, not always likable in the way that she treats Jamie, particular in the second act. The women in the film generally do not come off well here as they are either gullible or in Maggie's case, plain irrational. Notably, the love scenes shared between Jamie and Maggie are more frank than most mainstream comedies. It's just unfortunate that the film is a lot less interesting when the characters have their clothes on. Ultimately, the cardinal rule of a romantic comedy is broken: you don't care whether they end up together or not."

tt3766354,6.0,"If there's anyone in Hollywood that I would believe is actually a real life bada**, it's probably Denzel Washington. The first Equalizer was a surprisingly brutal and visceral action film that gave Liam Neeson movies a run for its money. While the sequel is full of just as many, if not more, incredible kill sequences by Denzel's character, I think there's a lack of connection I felt this time around. I wasn't nearly as connected to the story, and perhaps that's because the revenge didn't feel as sweet this time around. The ending of the film is a great sequence on its own and there are certain scenes I will certainly revisit, but I'm not sure the film as a whole works quite as well.6.6/10"
tt3766354,5.0,I had my expectations high because I was very impressed with the first one. Unfortunately this one is a bit of a disappointment owing to the pacing and predictability of the story. It was slower and boring. If they decide to make a third one then they should make it a bit more fast paced.
tt3766354,6.0,"If in the first opus, Robert McCall annihilates the Russian underworld of Boston, on the other hand, in the second opus, he ... helps. He just helps, nothing more. By being slightly in bad faith: he helps an elderly brother to find his sister, he helps a young woman abused by 3/4 men, he helps a student with his art studies, he helps a mother to find her young daughter gone on the wrong train, ...In the third opus (if any), he will probably be a nursery school supervisor and we'll see him reduced to dealing with conflicts between these kids.The second opus is significantly less exciting than the previous one. Still efficient but disappointing."
tt3766354,6.0,"The first movie had me enthralled and captivated, this second one, I just couldn't get into it in quite the same way, it was definitely action packed, and Washington delivers yet another knockout performance, but I just found the story a little lacklustre, and the characters just hard to like, empathise or engage with.In the first movie, Robert had one single purpose, he wanted revenge, nothing and nobody was going to stand in his way, he presented a relentless force, here the same can't be said, he seemed to be going through the motions for the sake of it.At times they were guilty of making Robert into a sort of superhero, no bullets, killers, not even the elements can barm him, he's like superman without a cape.On the plus side it's sharp looking, it's well paced, and it really is entertaining, if non stop gun action is your thing that is. I enjoyed the story of Robert getting to know Miles and trying to shape his path, but the actual body of the story was disappointing.I disagree with those that say this was slow, it's far from that, at times it was pretty frantic.I'm looking forward to seeing the third very soon, but this second movie was average at best.6/10."
tt3766354,5.0,"The sequel to the box office hit ""The Equalizer"" is surprising only in how boring it is. It's a weary and tiresome trudge through a hopelessly padded out two hour run-time that doesn't even really deliver on the action or violence fronts for most of its length.You know you're in trouble in an action movie where the only memorable scene involves removing paint from a wall.Apparently this is Washington's first ever sequel to any of his movies. Hopefully it will also be his last."
tt3766354,5.0,"Denzel Washington is back as Robert McCall, the ex-CIA operative who's trying to lead a moral life since the death of his wife. Much of the movie is taken up with his attempts to make sure that Ashton Sanders doesn't fall into the gang life, but works on his arts and reads classic books. However, when his old pal from the Agency, Melissa Leo, is brutally murdered by some ex-CIA thugs. McCall takes off his ring and has a Sergio Leone-inspired showdown with a squad of killers.I'm not sure what, if anything, there is in this script to make director Antoine Fuqua and Washington each make their first sequels. Perhaps they simply enjoy working with each other, and this was the project at hand; it was their fourth collaboration. For me, despite the usual graceful portrayal by Denzel Washington, I was not terribly engrossed. Probably it's Fuqua fascination with nastiness and violence for the sake of violence."

He is unable to access the more sensitive ship systems. After a year of loneliness, Jim is suicidal and then he falls in love with Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence). He decides to disable her pod and wake her up but keep the decision from her.This movie needs to start when Aurora wakes up. His decision is workable storytelling if we figure it out along with her. It could be a mystery with tension that turns into an action thriller. Also the movie is too desperate to be romantic. The fact that the audience knows what he did makes it impossible to get into the romantic mood. By starting the movie at the later spot, it can inject some creepiness and tension. It also makes the movie shorter which would help a lot. These are two hot A-list actors. It's easy to see how the studio automatically goes for the romantic route but the story is built for a tense thriller."
tt1355644,6.0,"Note that this contains spoilers. If you haven't watched the film, I suggest you do before reading this.The first hour or so of this film was fantastic. Just taking in the spacecraft with all its amazingly conceived features, was reminiscent of the first part of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It also struck me as being a realistic version of the type of spacecraft in Wall-E (think of the little cleaner droids, buzzing around, fixing things and cleaning the mess the characters make!) The premise of being alone on a vast, automated, self-repairing craft that is aware of your presence and provides all the conveniences you require, was an interesting concept. The technology and physics seemed plausible, cool, and realistic; and the special effects were restrained and effective. The robot bartender was fascinating, and provided some welcome entertainment.For the first hour the story seemed meaningful and thought-provoking, but after that it began to fall apart. A major aspect of the plot during the first half of the movie was being unable to get to the crews' quarters to wake them up, and the hopelessness of the situation because of this.Then, as if by magic, one of the crew wakes up, says there's something wrong with the ship, wanders around a bit, then dies. From then on it seemed to me like the script had been taken over by a different person, there to ensure the film served the public the usual smattering of sensationalist action scenes at expense of both the plot and plausibility of science. There is a brief promise of mystery as the trio realised there was something wrong with the ship and tried to figure out what it was, but this quickly evaporates as the problem turns out to be nothing more than a faulty nuclear reactor that is heading for self-destruction.The obvious thing to have done here would have been to wake more of the crew, now that they had access, to see what could be done. However, we are told there is not time for that, so the protagonist miraculously fixes the nuclear reactor all by himself. What a genius! This involved finding and hot-swapping a replacement circuit board, getting blasted into space, being spectacularly rescued by his female companion, dying, and finally brought back to life by having about a dozen or so different resuscitation techniques applied to him at once by a machine! Yeah. Face palm."
tt1355644,6.0,"The trailers to this film gives the impression that it's something of a weepy romance set aboard a spaceship . Guess what ?

Even so I still came away thinking it was a missed opportunity Let me explain . The pivotal plot element of ""Person waking up prematurely while in hyper-space"" is not only a good one but had been done earlier in the first season of SPACE 1999 which led to one of the most shocking endings I have seen in a TV show . Here however it really only exists to set up a story which will involve two people falling in love . Hey don't report me for giving away the story because this is exactly what happens . To its credit PASSENGERS does include a couple of twists involving obsession , betrayal of sorts and redemption and being something of an angst ridden tortured poet myself I did find myself being swept along to a degree as to the character interaction between Jim and Aurora and more specifically as to if Jim will be found out It's hardly the most complicated film of 2016 and I found myself wishing for a more complex and darker type of movie . As you can imagine - and imagination is in short supply from the Hollywood studios - you can't have this type of film without two good looking leads . The truth is Chris Pratt is maybe a little too handsome and hunky . How about a scenario where Jim is played by Robert Carlyle or Andy Serkis ? In other words someone who it's slightly difficult to fall in love with ? Love like life itself is a horrible , really horrible thing but not if it's featured in a Hollywood movie it seems"
tt1355644,6.0,"I'm just going to list my takeaways from the movie in list format. Maybe it will be helpful to someone, maybe not. Pros - The production is immaculate. The cinematography, set design, CGI, all of it is top notch, as expected from a movie starring two of the most popular current actors. - Although I'm not crazy about Jennifer Lawrence, and I only really like Chris Pratt as Starlord, I will go ahead and list them as a pro, since they did a good job with these characters. Michael Sheen is also welcome in any movie. Cons - The science of the movie is a bit slinky at times, obviously to serve narrative motives. Other reviewers have detailed these inaccuracies, so I won't get into it, here. - The movie mostly leans toward a romantic drama vibe, and I personally think there should have been more of a sense of dread and danger throughout the movie, not just near the end. - Given the high profile status of the leads, the sex scenes are predictably tame and brief. Along with the lack of danger, the lack of eroticism is another way in which the movie plays it too safe. - The catharsis at the end that stems from the main moral dilemma (which I won't spoil) does not occur satisfactorily in my opinion. It didn't move me at all, and made it feel like it was never that important to begin with.In summary, this is an entertaining, but light sci-fi romance. It feels like a 70's sci-thriller that has been thoroughly processed for a general audience. It makes a good rental, but I couldn't help but lament that it wasn't the riskier, edgier film that it wanted to be."
tt1355644,5.0,"The trailers made this out as serious science fiction, but it was basically a glorified ""boy meets girl"" movie in space. Apart from a sleep inducing middle act where nothing happens apart from the two leads courting each other, the suspension of disbelief needed here, is staggering, mainly in the form of seemingly superhuman protagonists. Some spoilers ahead:1. A woman passes out while in a bubble of water, effectively drowning, then miraculously ""wakes up"", while still in the water a few minutes later just because the bubble splashes down into a pool. 2. On multiple occasions people slipping on something and crash landing on their back leaves no damage other than them simply getting up and saying ""ouch"" as if it's a cartoon. 3. Male lead withstands thermonuclear blast at the end without as much as a heat rash, then runs out of oxygen due to a cracked helmet and drifts into space, but instead of freezing and suffocating when the air runs out gets rescued by his girlfriend who simply jumps off the star- ship in his general direction and miraculously catches him.4. Out of 5000 pods, the one of the guy they really need malfunctions, who wakes up, explains how they can save the ship (which he's completely unqualified for given his job), and then being the token black guy, dies pretty much straight away.6. Woman suffers major upper body trauma but carries on as if nothing happens.With a bit of care to some details and without the totally artificial and forced happy ending this could have been really good. As it is, it came across as desperate to not challenge its target audience too much and suffered for it."
tt0479537,6.0,"SERAPHIM FALLS boasts outstanding cinematography from the very beginning, with scenery ranging from snowy mountainous locales to sun-scorched deserts. The landscapes look and feel beautiful and the characters all have that weathered look, particularly Pierce Brosnan who's almost unrecognisable in the leading role.It kicks off with action at the outset and remains a chase film throughout. The storyline is slender and the back story annoyingly ambiguous, at least until a late-on flashback that solves that particular mystery. The chase stuff is done well, with tension, drama and violence. I always enjoy these survival-style stories so this is a bit of a no-brainer for me.Another highlight is the film's cast. Brosnan is on good form (I've always liked this actor, just not when he played Bond) and Neeson his match, but it's the supporting cast who interest me the most. Michael Wincott (ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES) had me thinking of a young Fred Ward throughout, Xander Berkeley gets to be gruff, scary Tom Noonan (THE MONSTER SQUAD) shows up as a preacher and Ed Lauter appears just as I was thinking of this film's similarity to the Charlie Bronson flick DEATH HUNT (in which Lauter also starred in virtually the same part).The ending is a little weird, moving on from the action-adventure format and becoming almost mystical and allegorical, featuring late-on cameos from Anjelica Huston and Wes Studi. It's not the most entirely satisfying ending I'd have considered, as it goes against the heartfelt vengeance focused upon for the rest of the movie, but at least it's different. A good, if not great, little movie."
tt0479537,6.0,"SERAPHIM FALLS is an odd film, one that on the surface appears to be an homage to the old Westerns, but proves to be a psychological battle for survival between two men engulfed in revenge. There is very little story to relate: Carver (Liam Neeson) with a small posse of bounty hunters (Michael Wincott, Ed Lauter, John Robinson and Robert Baker) treks Gideon (Pierce Brosnan) through snow, forests, mountains, rough water, and desert over a Civil Ear seed of hate. The 'story' fades to a philosophical stance (somewhat clumsily) by the intervention of some ghostly creatures (Anjelica Huston, et al) and ends without much more than a whisper of a memory about the futility of revenge.Bronson and Neeson do well with their scant dialogue, revealing more of their character's minds with physical action and the power of facial expressions. The mood of the film is in the superior hands of cinematographer John Toll and Harry Gregson-Williams' musical score. Director David Von Ancken keeps the tension at peak level even though the film is desperately in need of editing (just under tow long hours in length). But for a diversion and an appreciation for the wilderness of America in the mid-nineteenth century, SERAPHIM FALLS is a visually satisfying experience. Grady Harp"
tt0479537,5.0,"I like going into movies knowing little about them other than a few basics. Quite often, the less you know beforehand, the more enjoyable a movie can be. So all I knew about Seraphim Falls when I watched it was that it was a western. I didn't even know who was in it.Now, to start with, all was well. The frozen mountainous setting, Brosnan and Neeson, a tale of revenge. Who was Brosnan's character? Why was Neeson after him. All good stuff.Over the course of the next hour or so, more is revealed as the manhunt continues. Again, all good.But, oh dear, having convinced me it was a revenge-western, Seraphim Falls then proceeds to get a little bit weird. Characters appear in the middle of nowhere, offering temptations to Brosnan and Neeson's characters. At first I thought ""The characters are losing their minds, and this is what they are seeing."" But the gifts thus given to the duo are apparently real. If they had both died of thirst at the end and been found by a wandering cavalry detachment, say, then I could have forgiven this.But this is not what happens. I won't try and gloss over it. For a revenge flick this is a deeply unsatisfying conclusion. The trippy insanity is never explained and the whole thing leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste in the mouth.It's almost as if, having given us over an hour of blood and thunder, the director wanted to point out the folly of vengeance and how we should all just ""get along...."" If you like good old fashioned westerns give this one a miss. It starts off promising, but will hugely disappoint you in the end."
tt0479537,6.0,"It's 1868. This starts in the Mountains of the west. Gideon (Pierce Brosnan) barely escapes a posse led by Carver (Liam Neeson). They chase him from the mountains down to the deserts. It doesn't really explain the reason for the manhunt until close to the end.That's the big premise of this movie. It dives right into a chase without telling the audience the why. There is a certain fascination. It's almost as if the reason doesn't matter. In a certain way, it almost doesn't. That's why the reveal is rather a minor disappointment. It could never really satisfy the build up. I think it would be more compelling if they never showed the explanation. The ending does get a bit too surreal especially since the movie never hints at that kind of bent."
tt0479537,5.0,"There are many types of westerns! ""Seraphim Falls"" falls into the revenge category! We are witnesses to Pierce Brosnan being chased by Liam Neeson! Neeson wants revenge! The viewers are kept in the dark until the end! Only then it gets clear what the deal is about! What amazed me that Pierce Brosnan made very good use of his environment and knife! His guerrilla tactics isn't something you expect to see in a western! It could be that I am too old fashioned when it comes to this genre! But I did miss the shootouts! Somehow a western without shooting is like a kung fu movie without martial arts! At least that is what I expect ! I don't like realism in this type of genre! With shows like ""Deadwood"" very little is left to the imagination! Experimenting and doing something new is always appreciated! But isn't it possible to do so and still maintain some of the charm of the old westerns we all loved to see! (Movies like ""Blueberry"" or ""The missing"" are examples of these movies which successfully added new elements to typical western movies!) It is obvious that ""Seraphim Falls"" isn't your typical western! This western is not an action movie but more a drama about two men dealing with their past and the consequences of their actions in the past! Personally I liked the ending very much! I do have to say that this ending never would have worked if it weren't for the excellent performances by Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson! Brosnan has shown that he can do more than Bond and similar roles! He shows an intensity without using much words! Just brilliant! The wonderful performances however can't hide the fact that the story isn't that special or interesting! Overall I have very mixed feelings about this movie!"
tt0479537,5.0,"Terminally long with no end in sight, ""Seraphim Falls"" from TV director David Van Ancken will put most viewers to sleep as this western saga drags on and on. The revenge plot which this film is centered on has been done many times before and with much better results (""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" for one example). In this film, Liam Neeson chases Pierce Brosnan across most of the southwest territory of the United States as both men use up horses and canteens by the dozens. Along the way, we meet a number of what are supposed to be colorful characters or ""visions"" that may symbolize good and evil. Anjelica Huston and Wes Studi show up near the end of the film, but neither of them make much of an impression except to have their names added to the credits. What Ms. Huston is doing in the middle of the desert selling mysterious potions isn't given any adequate explanation other than the fact that she may be just a mirage. Veteran character actor Ed Lauter has the thankless role of one of Neeson's henchmen who gets left hanging in the middle of nowhere. His fate is quickly forgotten as the long chase continues. As for the two leads, Neeson and Brosnan, both gentlemen have seen better movies and scripts than the one they're stuck with in this box-office fiasco. ""Seraphim Falls"" director Van Ancken has plied his trade mainly on the small screen and been very successful there. His try for the big-time with this film did not turn out so well. You can't win them all.One of the problems with ""Seraphim Falls"" is that neither of the main characters qualify as the real protagonist. Neeson has good reason to be hunting down Brosnan who ordered the burning of his home during the Civil War (which also inadvertently killed Neeson's innocent family). Unfortunately, this key information is handed out ""piece-meal"" to the audience and Neeson's motivation for vengeance is revealed too late in the film. What we do know about Neeson's character is that during his chase for Brosnan, he becomes a murdering psychopath and gains little sympathy from viewers. Brosnan isn't much better himself although it seems he somewhat regrets his earlier actions. The problem with ""Seraphim Falls"" mainly lies with the ambiguous script which elongates this sad tale to an excruciating length. Viewers will need their own canteens of water just to sit through it. The ending is neither satisfying nor logical and the whole ordeal of watching this film is an exercise in futility. To put it bluntly, ""Seraphim Falls"" misfires on both barrels."

Conspiracy theorist KC Houseman (John Bradley) discovers that the moon's orbit is deteriorating and headed for earth. He tries to recruit Brian to contact NASA.Director Roland Emmerich has woven a conspiracy theory into his brand of action sci-fi thriller. I like the potential. I even like the outlandish concept. The first half is a little clunky but I'm willing to go with it. The problematic writing does build up over time. It's his never-ending close calls and melodramas. It's the awkward sci-fi. The second half stumbles here and there until it falls flat. Roland is no longer that guy anymore. He's not making the big budget action thriller hits."
tt5834426,6.0,"Emmerich - who you gonna hire when it comes to a movie of this kind and calibre? I mean one is almost tempted to say that he is doing one thing in different forms/movies. There are elements from so many other movies here. Be it in the characters or the themes of the movie. The important question though is: can you suspend your disbelief? And I don't mean just a little! I am talking about all the way here.And if you've done that, all the cliches come out and they will make you cringe. The characters feel like they have a story put upon them. You'll either find certain things gullible or plain offensive to your taste buds. The special effects are top notch, the dialog not so much. Many moments that feel ... lame quite frankly. The whole patriotism thing is to be expected - but that doesn't make it any better either. Michael Pena feels underused - I don't hate him - which may be just enough I reckon (pun intended).Patrick Wilson and Halle Berry are the ones that save the day (no pun intended). John Bradley may be the wild card - but he also is hit and miss. His character that is, he is trying his best I'd say. Just never critisize the conspiracy guy from Godzilla versus Kong ever again, if you actually love this character right here.Nothing more to say here other than it is quite rich, that Emmerich critisizes Star Wars and the MCU when he is unable to make a coherent Blockbuster of his own, that at times make Fast and Furious look like it's legit and realistic ... I know, right? But as you can see in my rating, I didn't mind too much ... or rather I'm being ""kind"" again - something I have been accused of a lot anyway."
tt5834426,5.0,"If you watch a disaster movie made by Roland Emmerich you get what you expect: big explosions, fine work by the special departments and a rather simple story with forgettable characters. Moonfall is no exception - get your coke and pop-corn, lay back and enjoy the show. But in the case you don't like that kind of big screen disaster movies, don't bother."
tt5834426,6.0,"Moonfall is, without a doubt, one of the stupidest movies ever made. Yet, it so gloriously 100% commits to its whirlwind of logic-defying hokey conspiracy theory-inspired nonsense that it sucks the audience into its vortex for a vastly entertaining ride.Two NASA astronauts Brian Harper and Jocinda ""Jo"" Fowler working together with conspiracy theorist K. C. Houseman discover a secret about the Moon after it leaves its orbit and veers toward Earth.I have never subscribed to the idea of turning off your brain to enjoy a movie. However, Moonfall, through its brand of pratfall sorcery, effectively shut off my brain. This was The Riddler's brain-drain machine from Batman Forever, dazzling me with spectacle while sucking up my IQ. I waved goodbye to logic, science, and generally ""how things work.""Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, John Bradley, Michael Pena, and the cast all do their best selling all the ridiculousness and delivering ultra-stilted dialogue. It's amusing watching them be so serious and hold it together. At any given moment, I imagine a slight smirk from any of the actors would have them all breaking and laughing.Moonfall was an unusually great time. I was riveted by the mystery behind the Moon and on the edge of my seat by the disaster sequences that ignore physics. The logic of how things progress from A to B is so warped that it inadvertently makes the story unpredictable. I was kind of amazed by where the story ended up. At the back of my mind the whole time, I was completely stupefied by how the movie was barely hanging together through its extravagant ambition.The film played like a parody of Roland Emmerich disaster movies itself and got away with it. This will vary for different people as it heavily depends if you can enjoy a bad movie. I enjoyed it unironically, which is odd and an achievement of sorts. I would love to see a sequel."

tt5834426,5.0,"Being a Millennial, I can attest to our generation that it was a great time to be alive with ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"" being some of our favorite tween-age blow-up-knock-down action movies to go see with our friends in the theater 3 times in the same day, with campy yet lovable characters like Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Those were the days. I still enjoy watching those flicks from time to time - not just for the nostalgia. They are still quite entertaining in their own right.Now we have ""Moonfall"" some 25 years later. Cut from the same construction paper, but more like pieces of old scripts from Roland Emmerich's late '90s writing room shredder taped together in hopes the characters and dialog would be usable in telling the grandiose destructo-type story instead of just talking props. Speaking of which, I give props to Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley (who actually had a solid character to go with his style) for trying, but it simply wasn't enough.I've listened to commentaries and interviews with Emmerich and I personally think he doesn't have good instincts on how to put a balanced action film together since the mid 2000s (with the ID4 sequel, if you watch the deleted scenes cut what would've been the best and most meaningful scenes of the entire movie) with the aim of just going big and loud, using any means whatsoever. It works...until it doesn't. Action fatigue sets in frequently in this and many of his recent past movies. It's alarming when I am physically incapable of caring less about the world ending than watching these characters attempt to get from beginning to end - in fact, there was no palpable peril despite the entire earth getting properly f'ed up, we only see it in overhead shots of floods and earthquakes and meteorites (I think COVID may have had something to do with not being able to have scenes with dozens of extras on the ground clamoring over each other like in all other action flicks from the days of yore).However, the concept was intriguing and in my opinion, pretty great. It reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's ""Rendezvous with Rama"" but with the Moon instead of a floating cylinder in space. I really did enjoy watching the last 20-30 mins or so play out after an hour and a half of random skipping around characters trying to hatch the plan to get us to that point while trying to make the audience like and/or care. If the script had half the heart and good campiness of something like ""Independence Day"", it definitely could have kicked my rating up a little.Wait for streaming."

Meanwhile, a seductive woman helps them launch a journey of self-discovery. Director Eddie Alcazar clearly takes influence on films like Lynch and strange art-house science fiction stories and with this being his first feature-length film, there are some great aspects to it.There are some weird stuff happening. The black and white colors, sound designs, and visuals are very interesting and great. The performances from the cast is interesting as the performances feel kind of weird or dull but I think it was intentional for the setting. It has a surprising cast and for the whole cast, they do a pretty good job on playing their strange roles. I don't mind strange films like these as they are one of the types of genre of filmmaking that I enjoy seeing.The main narrative is a bit strange and while it's very ambitious, the ambitious tone and presentation takes away from some of the writing elements as the writing elements at points felt underdeveloped or unfocused of what the intentions of the film wants to be. Some of the dialogue moments were pretty rough. The third act does start to feel a bit too silly at times which takes away some of the tension.Overall, it's definitely ambitious and a very strange type of film to watch. It's no where near one of my favorites on weird art-house films but there are some cool ideas that felt original.Rating: B-"
tt15444046,5.0,"Fantastic visuals, numbing story to the brain. While I do appreciate the straightforward allegories that were apparent, it seemed like this movie was relying on the visuals to save it. The story is super simple with overarching metaphors involved, yet, it seemed like certain scenes were missing it. The pacing was super off, but the visuals almost make up for it. Every shot looks like a charcoal pencil drawing that just adds to the nature of the film. Great concepts, yet not expansive to the point where I feel the lore could be elaborated on. I recommend solely for the visuals and set design, yet it's not much of a pleasing story."
tt15444046,6.0,"If you wish you lived in a parallel universe where in the early 1990s, Paul Verhoeven had smoked a lot of weed, then made a low-budget black and white mashup of Eraserhead, Crimes of the Future (1970), and How to Talk to Girls at Parties, Divinity will likely be your dream made flesh. Lumpy, misshapen flesh, covered in grotesque goo.If even one of those elements gives you mixed or negative feelings, Divinity will probably not be your cup of tea. This is not a film like Aliens or Barbie, with so many different well-made elements that just about anyone will enjoy the experience. Divinity is (metaphorically, not literally) a Masters of the Universe (1987), Tokyo Gore Police, or Revenge of the Ninja (1983). If it's not exactly on your wavelength, your experience (like mine) will probably be similar to seeing a Facebook ad for a supposed medical device that clearly has off-label purposes you're not interested in. You might (like me) appreciate that it was made with love and has a good cast (Scott Bakula in particular), but you will probably be bemused by the experience as a whole."
tt1790864,6.0,"My immediate thought while watching The Maze Runner was just how close the whole premise was to Vincent Natali's sci-fi horror Cube (1997), both films featuring a group of people who wake to find themselves in a strange environment with no memory of how they got there. The big difference is that, where Cube was a brilliantly executed low-budget thriller with nail-biting tension and a thought provoking ambiguous climax, The Maze Runner is a mega-budget blockbuster that, for much of its running time, moves like molasses, and which ends leaving questions that we know will be answered, just so long as we shell out more cash to see the next couple of instalments.Obviously, at 47 I'm not exactly in the intended demographic for this film, but I do feel that this one missed the opportunity to be a hugely entertaining adventure for all ages. When the characters are in the maze, running for their lives from the grievers (metallic insectoid monsters), or dodging the changing architecture, the film is actually very enjoyable, but far too much time is spent in the relative safety of 'the glade', the idyllic green area at the centre of the maze where the boys first wake up. With my son currently reading the series of books, it's almost certain that I'll have to watch the sequels; I just hope that they make it a little more exciting next time around (and don't cut the film to reduce the UK rating to a 12 certificate. Grrrrrr!).5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb."

Eventually a girl (Kaya Scodelario) shows up.If you are a teen or tween and like all those kids save the world offerings, this one falls in line. The film is done well enough to hold your interest as the Maze creates a mystery for our human lab rats. The ending tells you why it was done, which still didn't make any sense...and why all guys, or why only one girl? It leads to a sequel. The acting was bland. The dialogue needed zip and Gally (Will Poulter) was a boring antagonist. Good enough for the kids who won't know the difference.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
tt1790864,6.0,"Although The Maze Runner story isn't one of the brilliants I have seen, it is interesting enough to satisfy my interest. Opening scene is intriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story itself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such movies as Cube and TV- shows like Lost keeps you interest awake about what to come. Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at the forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great scenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring this movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those Hollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days.

There are 'Maze runners' within the community that have spent three years trying to find a way out. Thomas has disturbing flashbacks, some kind of medical procedure. He gets trapped in the maze and begins to discover what's going on.I'm assuming that writer Noah Openheim was a bit of a fan of Lost, it feels a little like it, crossed with Lord of the Flies. It's quite an interesting concept I guess, it just doesn't feel very original or extraordinary. There is one serious amount of running around.A couple of jumps I suppose, not scary in the least, but there is a bit of action. The grievers are quite an interesting creation, like Spidery Aliens i guess.The arrival of Teresa was quite horrendous (bit of a stretch from Skins!!) Her accent did veer from Amercianish to English.

She initially makes ends meet at a local strip club where anything goes until she meets a man who agrees to help her refine her technique until is recognized by a more reputable dance company. Once she joins the reputable dance company she discovers it may not be as reputable as it appears.This movie is directed by Paul Verhoeven (Robocop) and stars Elizabeth Berkley (Saved by the Bell), Kyle MacLachlan (Dune), Gina Gershon (Killer Joe), Glenn Plummer (South Central), Robert Davi (The Goonies) and William Shockley (Robocop).This movie is more fun to watch than actually good. The women are gorgeous and the dance scenes are very well done. The settings, attire and circumstances are interesting. The storyline is uneven and had potential but could have been executed better. The cast is impressive and well selected. There is an abundance of nudity throughout this picture and a great pool sex scene. The rape scene was tough and how it was handled felt unrealistic, as did several parts of the ending. However, this movie is hard not to watch and enjoy the journey it takes you on.Overall, this movie is not good but it is entertaining and worth a watch. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing once."
tt0114436,6.0,"No, it isn't a great, or terribly good, movie. I've certainly seen worse. And it is certainly too bad that this seemed to ruin Elizabeth Berkley's career. I didn't find her acting to be all that bad. I think that she was a victim to her role. She might not have had the star power or charisma to overcome a bad role, but I think she played it exactly the way Verhoeven wanted. Not sure that the nudity was a problem either, as I don't recall 1995 being all that puritanical. The rest of the acting was OK, too. I've never been a fan of Kyle MacLachland, but his skeevy smarminess was well-suited to his character. Gina Gershon seemed to have great fun chewing the scenery. No, the problem with the film was that every character was intensely dislikeable. (With the exception of Gina Rivera's Molly character) The exposition of Nomi's problems came way toward the end of the movie, when it was really too late to give her a break for all of her previous behavior. I think most of the blame for this being a poorer movie than it needed to be was Eszterhas's."

The problem with Paul Verhoeven is that nobody realises that he's a satirist. All his films shot outside of the Netherlands are intensely satirical and not meant to be taken at face value. With ""Showgirls"" he quotes from ""All about Eve"" and ""42nd Street"", tearing apart those pipe dream stories that audiences have been so conditioned to absorb.Verhoeven's real target isn't Hollywood or American crassness, but rather those morally dubious ""Star is Born"" tales. The audience isn't punished for wanting to see sex and nudity, it's punished for wanting Nomi to succeed. The film is saying that in a crass society, success is bankrupt, and by pushing the pipe dream, you merely fuel this big, ugly machine.Nomi, the star of ""Showgirls"", isn't a character. She's a piece of wood. A piece of wood not because she can't act, but because she's a mere slab of fuel, existing solely to be burnt up and combusted by her neon lit environment. She goes from strip club, to dance club, to theatre house, exploited all the way. And she loves it.By the end of the film it's not funny that Nomi is going to make the same mistakes all over again. It's sad that despite the fact that the Myth has been revealed repeatedly, she is still seduced by it enough to try all over again. It's like those Toys they give kids at Macdonald's. The child knows the toy is total crap, but they just have to collect the other one. Why? Because it's a toy, and the child's perception is that toys are fun.""Showgirls"" deals with this false perception. The toy is crap. It's unsatisfying, but we want it because we can't find satisfaction in what we have and in where we're at.""Showgirls"" is also intensely symbolic. Song titles mirror Nomi's apartment numbers, each of her jobs takes her one step further into hell (which ironically is her goal), she symbolically dies and is reborn, the famous lapdance is shot to mirror the sex scene in the pool, and the film ends with Nomi battered and broken and more importantly, even more ignorant than before. Then there's her ""dream man"" (hinted at by a billboard at the start) who turns out to be a devilish rapist by the end of the film. This theme of one being punished for ones ""fantasies"" permeates the entire film and extends outward in such a way that the audience itself participates. At first we're titillated, but by the end, the sex has numbed us and we reel in disgust.In terms of style, the film is intentionally over the top. It's loud, crass and overly colourful. Nomi herself thrusts her body at us in a ridiculously pathetic manner. The director's aim is not to titillate. He wants us to pity the girl's desperation, her falsity, the tasteless stains of her makeup and desperate contortions of her body. Nomi is dumb and is always begging us to accept her. And so Verhoeven subjects us to visual and aural overload, all designed to numb our minds. We leave the film stupid, and unaroused, poetically blind and unaware of the truths it has shown us.The best satires tend to raise the most unjustified hate, and ""Showgirls"" is no different. What's different is that the nudity, sex and overall tacky ""bad movie"" aesthetic of the film, prevents it from being re-evaluated or even embraced. Future audiences, desensitized to pornography and nudity, will probably accept this film easier.There's also one really good shot in the film that reminded me of Welles. The shot occurs when Nomi sits on a park bench alongside a busy street. The bench is in the foreground, but perspective is forced in such a way that it dwarfs the Las Vegas buildings surrounding it.In terms of camera work, the film is also impeccably shot. Verhoeven's camera is precise, with some beautiful steadicam and crane shots.7.5/10- An interesting satire, intentionally camp, cartoonish and over the top. Though some scenes feel tasteless, the film as a whole surprisingly seems to get better with repeated viewings. Pay attention to one scene in which children walk innocently through a theatre, nude women all around. Moment's later a woman curses violently and the kids and their mother are shocked. Verhoeven's point is clear: language, violence and exploitation are far more tasteless than any naked breast."
tt0114436,5.0,"There's a point in this film, where it takes a sharp, serious and dark turn, out of damn near nowhere, and it's that moment in the movie that encapsulates just how unfocused Showgirls is.If I was to take this movie seriously, it would be a 3.5/10. If I weren't to take it seriously, then it would be 6/10. The sexiness and erotica points of the film were done relatively well, however, the story, the acting and over acting, the pace and those hilariously ridiculous seizure fests they tried to pass off as dancing or some kind of choreography were just too shockingly laughable.Showgirls is sexy, especially Elizabeth Berkley, and is as progressive as any ordinary film tends and needs to be without being static, however, it ran longer than it had to, and that just stretched an already poorly handled story too thin. Its structure and pace doesn't allow one to feel the necessary emotions of sympathy, however parts like what happens in the beginning of the movie give it some edge. I'll meet Showgirls halfway and give it 5/10."
tt0114436,5.0,"I've waited years to write a review of this train wreck meets a dumpster fire of a film and, having just rewatched it for the 6th or 7th time, I'm finally ready.There is so much glorious awfulness in this film it's difficult to know where to start. Elizabeth Berkley is way out of her depth playing the lead. She seems to be trying really hard, but just doesn't have the necessary acting chops to pull it off. She is playing it straight but doesn't realize it needed to be performed with an excess of arch campiness. Gina Gershon, who is way better than this material, said in an interview that when she finally realized that the film couldn't be taken seriously (apparently the director didn't convey that too well - more on him later), she got on board and provided the over-the-top archness required, somewhere around Joan Collins level. Kyle Maclachlan looks simply embarrassed by the whole affair; more power to him. The other actors are saddled with paper thin, one note, underwritten characters and deliver appropriate performances for them.Writer Joe Eszterhas has turned out a script that seems to have been written by a 15 year-old, brain damaged and oversexed boy who is still a virgin. His dialog is ridiculous in the extreme, as if he had no idea how real people might speak to, or behave around, each other. It's an almost surreal experience to hear some of the tone-deaf exchanges in the movie. Joe apparently learned nothing between penning Flashdance and this film. At least Flashdance had some good music in it; this flick just has mortifying, forgettable dance numbers.Director Paul Verhoeven, who directed some of my favorite films including RoboCop and Total Recall, bungles this film most delightfully. He seems more interested in nipples, and insuring the female cast members show them at all times, than in getting a decent performance from anyone. Those nipples get ice, champagne, sequins and lipstick on them. They are ready to go out and partay! Maybe if Paul could have gotten all the actors on the same page with their performances by explaining the satirical tone of the movie (if indeed that really was the aim of the script - I have my doubts), this might have been a way funnier, though not as deliciously inept and awful, cinematic exercise.So why can't I go more than a few years without watching it again and again?"
tt0114436,5.0,Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) hitchhikes into Las Vegas and gets her suitcase stolen. She befriends Molly Abrams (Gina Ravera) who is a seamstress backstage at the Stardust Hotel show where Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon) is the star. Nomi has a job as a stripper at the seedy Cheetah Club run by Al Torres (Robert Davi). Cristal shows up at the club and buys a lap dance with Nomi for boyfriend Zack Carey (Kyle MacLachlan). James Smith (Glenn Plummer) becomes her conscience and her teacher.It's so bad that it's good. That's a popular opinion but it's not mine. Berkley's wild over-acting is too annoying. I keep thinking that this could be good cheese if Berkley could calm down. I think people are concentrating too much on the nudity of this Paul Verhoeven Joe Eszterhas concoction. The B-movie erotica is not the big problem. It's the horrible smell of angry relentless forced cheesiness. I do like Gina Gershon's performance but there is too many annoying things about this movie.
tt0114436,5.0,"Well, actually, it concerns the three films Paul Verhoeven has made since Basic Instinct. In order, they are Showgirls, Starship Troopers, and Hollow Man. Think back to the time when Basic Instinct was released, and a sexually repressed American nation, despite the misguided and utterly stupid protests of gay activists, was acknowledging for the first time since the 1970s that sex is a natural, healthy part of life and nothing to be ashamed of. The so-called Erotic Thriller had become a new mainstream, and this is where Verhoeven's problems with the mainstream American media began.As Hollow Man quickly demonstrates, the more mainstream Paul Verhoeven's films become, the more slated they get by the critics. Which is fair enough - the less it works, too. Starship Troopers toned down the sex to almost American standards (the sex scene is still far more stimulating than anything American directors have produced), and brought the violence up to a level more palatable to American audiences. It is a well-known statistical fact outside of America that parents in the USA are more comfortable with their children seeing other human beings torture and multilate one another than they are with their children seeing a decent, healthy act that forms the basic step in how our species perpetuates itself.Critics in America attacked Starship Troopers as being facistic and shallow, when the reality is that the film was based upon the same propaganda films that were shown to young Americans in the 1940s. The critical misbalance was even more apparent with Hollow Man, Verhoeven's most mainstream film to date. Here he was, giving American audiences what they indicated they want, while lacing it with a morality play based on what happens when a man with Christianised morals loses his accountability, and the critics had the nerve to claim it had no story. I think there is something fundamentally wrong with American media in light of that.Returning to the time when Showgirls was produced, the Erotic Thriller was the newest idea from Hollywood, and Basic Instinct brought a whole different audience to the theatre - those who wanted softcore porn and weren't afraid of the fact. Unfortunately, one of the minds who was responsible for creating this whole new sub-genre, Joe Eszterhas, is quite patently a sick, misogynistic, and repressed individual. Just like the gay activists protesting Basic Instinct unfairly charged Verhoeven with homophobia, ironically. If you don't believe me, I invite you to take a look at Eszterhas' two subsequent films, Sliver and Jade, then tell me that Verhoeven is solely responsible for the misogynistic flavour of Showgirls.Of course, the difference between Showgirls and Basic Instinct is that when Basic Instinct was made, Eszterhas still had to sell his screenplays to studios, whereas he only had to say ""I wrote Basic Instinct"" when trying to shuffle his screenplays for Showgirls, Jade, and Sliver to studios. Seriously, watch those three together, they should be called ""the misogyny trilogy"".Anyway, the whole upshot of this is that Paul Verhoeven is currently copping a very raw deal from the critics. While I wouldn't call his last two films faultless, even Showgirls deserves to have its artistic merits considered. Any film that is released in a repressive society like America and somehow manages to turn nudity into a uniform has got to have something going for it.Frankly, I hope Paul does go through with the idea he was contemplating earlier - to go back to Europe and make films without the atmosphere of retarded, repressive critics and the Motion Picture Annoyance Association breathing down his neck. Maybe back there he can make films that portray the world as it really is instead of having to sugar-coat it for Americans who don't like having the mirror held up to their Christian sexual repression. Or better still, I hope his next project once again engages Ed Neumeier's services as a screenwriter."
tt0114436,5.0,"When I reviewed this title a year ago, I gave it 3 out of 10 stars and said I'd never watch it again. Well, I decided to give it another chance and watched it two more times when my son wasn't around. I still say it has a poor moral message (that one must resort to devious tactics to get ahead), but I'll admit that it wasn't as bad as I remembered it to be when I saw it 5 years ago. Is it smut? Yes, in several parts, it is smut. But I think what the actual message was, women (and some men) are used for their bodies in the sleazy underbelly of Las Vegas. Also, I think Hollywood was very unfair to Elizabeth Berkley after this movie tanked. I'm not saying it's a favorite of mine (it's not), but it undoubtedly took a lot of courage and hard work to complete this movie. I'm actually really sorry that Elizabeth Berkley's career never recovered after this. She's talented and this movie could have been a lot better; I think the execution was wrong, is all. So it's not a favorite of mine, but I'll admit that it's not nearly as bad as some other movies I've seen in the past. I give it 5 out of 10 stars, for the effort."
tt0114436,5.0,"Showgirls is one of those movies that falls into the genre:""sleezeart"". It's not a movie to be taken seriously in any way and it definetly is the quintessential ""bachelor party"" dream movie.To be fair though I saw this in the theatres(went in not having any idea what it was) and proceeded to  definetly be entertained so the evening wasn't a total waste. This is, at least a mvoie one can howl over. When it was over most of the comments were about how bad it was. But at least it wasn't boring.In all seriousness-the title itself is a dead giveaway that one isn't going in to see shakespear. Showgirls is what it is-its a movie about Las Vegas,strippers and what else?-showgirls. Not a movie to take seriously but hardly boring-and though i have no desire to see it again I could see this one being viewed in a big party situation with people whooping and hollering-its that kind of movie and it knows it.But I don't think the movie was meant to be taken seriously. This is not a sex moive that thinks of itself as anything else-I didnt get the feeling, unlike ""wild orchid"" for example this movie thought it was great-it was just a  sex and showgirl party movie and speaking of ""wild orchid"" this one at least managed to be better then that so thats 1 good thing."
tt1655389,5.0,"If you're going to fictionalize the life of one of the movie icons of the 20th century why go there, to the darkest dark. There are some ""invented"" moments that are, quite frankly, unforgivable. What kept me glued to the screen was Ana de Armas. A tremendous show of talent and fearlessness. I was wondering what the experience would have been to watch it in a theater with other people? I don't know because in the privacy of my own home I was free to stand up and walk away to pour myself a drink and shout at the screen. The awful Kennedy episode for instance. Why? That episode in particular made me question the intention of the filmmakers. So, yes, I can say now that I've seen it. Loved some it and detested some it."
tt1655389,5.0,"What a truly disappointing film this is. It offers us a really slow, sterile and disjointed - almost episodic - depiction of just how Marilyn Monroe's life might have panned out. For a start, I couldn't decide whether Ana de Armas was really Lady Gaga or Scarlett Johansson (both of whom would have acquitted themselves better, I'd say) as she offers an admittedly intense, but remarkably uninvolved performance. We move along from chapter to chapter in her life hindered by some fairly weak and uninspiring dialogue and seriously intrusive scoring in what becomes an increasingly shallow and lacklustre fashion. The photography does try hard - it does offer us a sense of intimacy, but the whole thing is presented in such a stylised and un-natural manner that it is frequently difficult to tell whether she is/was a ""real"" woman. Her marriages are treated in an almost scant manner - and her relationship with JFK is reduced to something rather implausibly one-sided and sordid showing nothing of how their relationship might have come to be. It has no soul, this film. Aside from her glamour - which was, even then, hardly unique we are not really introduced to any of the nuances of her character, we are left guessing a lot of the time as to just how she did become such a superstar, and how she spiralled so inevitably into a maelstrom of booze and pills. It relies to a considerable extent on the viewer's existing knowledge of, and affection for, this flawed lady. Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale don't really have much chance to add anything as her husbands and the highly speculative relationship between her and Charlie Chaplin Jnr (Xavier Samuel) and his sexually ambiguous partner-in-crime Edward G Robinson Jr (Scoot McNairy) does suggest something of the rather profligate and debauched existence that some lived in Hollywood, but again their characters are also largely undercooked and again, we are largely left to use our own imagination. It is far, far too long and in a packed cinema, I could see people looking at the ceiling just once too often. Watchable, certainly, but a real missed opportunity to offer us something scintillating and tantalising about this most of iconic of women."
tt1655389,6.0,"Blonde review :A supposed biopic on the Hollywood diva Marilyn Monroe; Blonde has a scene where a group of snobbish oldies ask a young Monroe if her blonde hair is real? To which he hesitantly replies No. The moment is given a surreal touch depicting the insecurities of a star who had faced a troubled childhood and was a lonely loser beneath all that gloss and glamour.The film's biggest positive is of course Ana De Armas who literally gets in to the skin of the titular character. Her transformation from the diffident Norma Jeane to the movie star Marilyn is truly incredible and full marks to her for getting it bang on...brilliant indeed!Director Andrew Dominik doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of Monroe's life whether it was her blatant exploitation by the filmmakers of that era or her illicit relationship with the President of United States. It's all there and in all its gory details!! Marilyn's ""threesome"" relationship is also explored uninhibitantly.On the flipside, the pacing is super slow and some scenes just don't make any sense. Like Norma hallucinating an abortion. Also, Monroe's (in)famous skirt blowing moment in The Seven Year Itch (1955) is filmed in multiple angles here with her undergarments on full display reeking of cheap titillation. Ooff!With all its plus and cons, Blonde aint too bad for a Netflix watch. It could've been a far better movie though.Regards,

Viola falls in love for her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) that has a crush on Olivia Lennox (Laura Ramsey) that feels attracted by the sensitive Sebastian (indeed Viola) that is chased by his girlfriend Monique (Alex Breckenridge). Out of the blue, the real Sebastian anticipates his return from London and he is not aware of the situation and has to play soccer game against Cornwall.""He's the Man"" is a funny and entertaining comedy with a predictable story similar to the 1985 ""Just One of the Guys"". The cute Amanda Bynes does not look like a boy but her performance is pleasant. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Ela é o Cara"" (""She is the Guy"")"
tt0454945,6.0,"Viola Johnson (Amanda Bynes) enters a prestigious boarding school disguised as her brother, so that he can run off to London to become a musician. Unfortunately, she immediately falls for her male roommate, who already has a crush on a girl who now has a crush on the male version of Viola.Combining the story of ""Just One of the Guys"" and Shakespeare's The Twelfth Night may sound like a recipe for disaster but She's the Man is a funny, charming and cheesy movie. The original trailer looked really lame yet the film turned out to be quite enjoyable. The story is clearly nothing new but it still works fine. The fact that the screenplay is written by Karen McCullah Lutz explains everything. She's good for harmless, fun films like She's the Man, Legally Blonde and Ella Enchanted. Andy Fickman does a decent job as the director. He never lets the film become too serious or else it would ruin the movie's appeal. He does overload on a few lame jokes though. That was the major problem I had with this film. Some of the jokes just fell flat while others were just incredibly cheesy, even for this film.The acting was good for this type of movie and most of the actors were enjoyable to watch on screen. Amanda Bynes is full of charm as Viola. It was very hard to actually hate her and she's a much better actress than Hilary Duff. Channing Tatum was not as strong as Amanda. His performance was okay, sometimes his reactions were a little fake. Laura Ramsey plays Olivia and she gives a decent performance. Alex Breckenridge gives a pretty good performance as Monique. Her character was pretty interesting and she had decent chemistry with Amanda. The rest of the supporting actors are good except for David Cross. He plays the school principal and his performance was not funny at all.If you do give She's the Man a shot then keep in mind that the entire film is highly unrealistic. I was reading some of the posts here and a few people are bashing the film for that. While the movie is pretty entertaining, it's also easily forgettable. It was a fun way to spend 100 minutes but it won't stay in your memory for long. It's also not just a chick flick and a guy could also like the movie. In the end, She's the Man is worth checking out whether that be in the theaters or on video. Rating 7/10"
tt0454945,6.0,"Though I hate to admit it, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have scored again. ""She's the Man"" is a ridiculous but ultimately entertaining teen movie which takes the gender-bending action of Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" and drops it in the middle of a modern-day American boarding school. The premise should sound familiar because screenwriters Lutz and Smith also penned ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" another twist on Shakespeare, starring the likes of Julia Styles and Academy Award nominee Heath Ledger (before he was an Academy Award nominee).It's more of the same, of course, but seeing Shakespeare's work go Hollywood, and, thus, be ripped to shreds, continues to amuse. ""She's the Man"" also focuses on a decidedly less bitter heroine than the shrew, Katarina, played in 1999 by a very stilted Styles. If that makes the film less witty, who cares? Not half of this film's target audience, who came mostly to see Channing Tatum with his shirt off.Like Kat in ""10 Things,"" Viola (Amanda Bynes) is a tomboy and a soccer star on the women's team at Cornwall Prep. Her life is soccer, which becomes a problem when her school cuts the women from the sports program. Better than most of the boys, Viola wants to suit up with them but is snubbed by both the coach and the team's captain – her boyfriend. So it's ""end of discussion  end of relationship."" Viola hatches a plan to pursue her sporting dreams at rival school Illyria, where her twin brother has just enrolled. Twin brother, Sebastian, is skipping off to England for two weeks and nobody at Illyria has ever met him.If you missed the set up, read ""Twelfth Night."" It's pretty obvious what happens from here. Viola disguises herself as her brother and moves into the dorms where she meets her roommate and fellow soccer player Duke (Channing Tatum). She begins to gear up for Illyria's season opener against Cornwall and has to navigate a complicated love-triangle, in addition to other challenges like taking a shower alongside her male teammates, without them finding out about her girl parts.In reality, nobody who looks like Bynes could get away with impersonating a 17 year-old male. Viola is too pretty to be a boy; in other words, dressed as her brother, she makes Orlando Bloom look like a frost-bitten lumberjack. This fantasy aspect doesn't detract from the film, though. Viola puts on her wig and fake sideburns and, suddenly, she's the most socially awkward nerd-boy you've ever seen. Suspension of disbelief works.The Sebastian disguise doesn't have to be convincing. What matters is that all the other characters are oblivious to facts that are obvious to the audience. The laughs come from seeing Viola get away with a ridiculous scam. In one scene, Duke and fake Sebastian hug each other, but Viola slips out of character and gets a little too friendly. It's not that homoeroticism or homophobia are inherently funny, it's the knowledge that Duke is disturbed by being frisked by someone who is actually a girl that makes us laugh.Other than that, ""She's the Man"" offers audiences the simple pleasure of Amanda Bynes who seems to be a natural in comedic roles. Her Sebastian/Viola is definitely a caricature but it's a perfectly illustrated one. From her mixed-up half southern, half Canadian drawl (her misguided version of the typical teen boy cadence), to her crotch grabbing and Eminem-like posturing, Bynes has a lot of fun and, as a result, the jokes land.It's a teen movie, so the ending is typical and cheesy. While sister film ""10 Things I Hate About You"" had a wild feminist streak in it and touched on somewhat weighty issues, such as the pressure to have sex, ""She's the Man"" lacks a serious undercurrent. But this is probably a good thing. ""10 Things"" was, at times, too earnest and moralizing. ""She's the Man"" doesn't pretend to be more important than it is. It'll earn a spot on the shelf, in between ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and ""Legally Blonde."" (And, like Reese, maybe Bynes will win an Oscar in 10 years. Anything is possible – just look at how ""Crash"" won Best Film.)Copyright (c) 2006 by Lauren Simpson"

The film also had enough pretty people to make the setting nothing like any normal person's high school.

Most of the times though, is about reconciliation between the members of the family, and re-ignition of old flames from their childhood.This is most definitely a comedy. There are some dilemmas to deal with, and a few emotional surprises but, although strong, are presented in a fun way.And there is a lot of fun in this movies, mainly because of the chemistry of some experienced TV actors who can play roles like these in their sleep.

Over the course of this story Bateman's character Judd will come to terms with things in his family, but more-so with his wife's infidelity (and then a pregnancy, aye) and then a possible budding relationship with a girl he used to know (Rose Byrne). Decisions decisions! The problem is, and it's major, is that This is Where I Leave You is also a completely lackluster comedy by a hack director (Shawn Levy, who didn't mess up too bad with Date Night but has otherwise had a sucky career in Hollywood), and a stripped-down adapted script. From what I've been told the book was good, really good, excellent even. But of course tone is always the thing, and what gets lost in an adaptation like this is how a character like Judd views these events in first person and with more details about these people than what is crammed into this. This is not to say the material would suit it longer - heaven forbid this was a TV show - but everyone is drawn so cartoonishly, so much like sitcom types. Only Bateman and maybe, arguably, sorta, Fonda's matriarch have more than a dimension.Which, when you have actors like Tina Fey (she plays kinda helpful, kinda a dope) and Courtney Stoll (so good on House of Cards, here reduced to 'I'm frustrated and angry and RAWR!) and then Adam Driver. He's actually not very good at all, though his character is mostly reduced to the loud-mouth annoying caricature who, frankly, doesn't seem realistic at all, like he's drawn out of parts of a sarcastic side of a brain with only the slivers of any decency thrown in there. Of course that's comic relief talking, but the comedy just falls flat, or only a line or two work. 'Situations' also keep happening as well - could Bateman help out his (I'm not kidding) sister-in-law to procreate? Or what about mom's Big New Breasts? Or what about smoking weed at the synagogue? A lot of these things, and even little character moments, I could see being workable, funny, meaningful in a book. Under Levy's direction, and somehow through Tropper's own script chopping up the narrative, it's kind of a mess. It's nice to see the dramatic side workable and have some lasting power during the film, and Bateman is able to find a solid character to work through in that, but it's not enough to make it a good movie. In a strange coincidence just a couple of weeks after this movie would come out, also by Warner brothers, The Judge would appear in theaters and have a similar premise and with less characters (that's another thing, TOO many characters, TOO much quirk) fared better.Bottom line though, if I'm going to watch Jason Bateman surrounded by a family that is all over the place and half the time genuine and the other time totally plastic and dumb, two words instead: Arrested Development. More to the point, an Arrested Development Movie at this point would be nice, but I digress. 5.5/10"
tt29538571,6.0,"Genre films generally have a very difficult time in German-speaking cinema. And when it comes to action films in particular, German filmmaking lags far behind. I personally can only remember the humorous MMA hit PLAN B (2016) by Ufuk GENC with the superb stuntman Can AYDIN, which at least made people sit up and take notice that this genre is also possible in German-speaking countries. It's a good thing that the global streaming service NETFLIX definitely has a taste for unusual experiments. And lo and behold, successful director Oliver KIENLE (BAD BANKS) lets a remarkably well-trained Emilio SAKRAYA, like Franka POTENTE as Lola, run through Berlin against the merciless passage of time. Why this action occurs plays only a minor role. The only important thing is that Emilio SAKRAYA's Octavio is in a perceived emergency and therefore has to beat up half of the gangster world in the German capital. After all, why does he have his impressive MMA skills?There's never a dull moment in this stylish, non-stop film, but you won't find any special flashes of inspiration in the script. But that's not a bad thing either. The film is a vehicle through which Emilio SAKRAYA can recommend himself for further roles in international action cinema. In addition to all the fighting, he can also play.Dennis MOJEN and the internationally booked stunt people Marie MOUROUM and Bruno SALGUEIRO also appear in other roles. Otherwise, the other stunt people probably come mainly from Hungary. Oh yes, a very cute kitten named Onion steals the show from the hardened whipping boy.Even if the film will certainly not become a classic of the genre, it is definitely good that German filmmakers are finally tackling such genres that are popular with global audiences. Keep it up!"
tt29538571,5.0,"I get it that the action movies aren't known for their story or logic, yet I recently caught this flick on Netflix, and I believe this one takes the recent lead as the stupidest action movie of recent times.For example the plot revolves around semi poor MMA fighter\gym owner who suppose to do a fight which will bring him a lot of money, yet decides to quit to get to his daughter birthday because his ex decided she'd sue him for sole custody because he's no show. The whole movie happens during 60 minutes period of time.He decides to run away (literally by foot), though eventually he loses everything and on the way fights his opponent anyway.Aside from numerous plot problems that are ridiculous at best, the thing that caught my eye was the main lead's earbuds. There is literally zero chance they'd stay inside his ears entire time through his fighting sequences. It's a small detail, but it's been a problem for me for a long time.The fighting scenes are decent and that's the only reason I gave this movie 5/10.Considering everything, I guess this movie can work if you're under the influence and are looking for some mindless action flick."
tt29538571,5.0,"It was fun to watch this movie because of those nice fighting scenes. But there were a lot of problems with plot and continuity.First, it was a stupid idea to talk on the phone just before a cage fight. Pros don't do that.Second, presenting the woman as a big problem is the point i will not get.Third, how is it possible that usual mafia guys can take so mich damage and can still involve in fights again and again?Fourth and the worst, by the way i did not see this in the reviews, day and night problem. So as we see in the movie, Berlin can jump from afternoon sun to midnight darkness in sixty minutes? And it's frim 17.00 to 18.00?And finally, who the heck is that lawyer?"
tt29538571,5.0,"This movie was ridiculous. But i of course watched it for the eye candy that is Emilio Sakraya. Be warned however that the plot of this movie is completely absurd!The movie centers around a young man who has 60 minutes to get to his daughter's birthday party or he loses custody of her. The problem is ...he also has a fight event.Due to his dilemma he bails on his match and it almost seems counter productive for him not to go through with it??? When he actually could have just done and gotten his actual match over with and plenty of time to spare to take a relaxing uber ride to his daughter's birthday??? Also what kinda asshole tells her kid's father that he is gonna lose custody of his only child that he clearly loves and who loves him back within an hour? Ok fine.But alas...there would be no movie if things actually made sense. Youre gonna have to suspend your disbelief while watching this.Anyways, he ends up destroying everyone and everything in his path in a quick and efficient way (once again proving if he hadnt bailed on the fight he couldve had his opponent on the ground within minutes with plenty of time to spare and take a shower, change clothes, do a photo op, save his gym and not lose custody of his daughter.) But okay.The point of this movie is really and clearly the martial arts, the fights scenes were great and entertaining honestly...so for that im giving it a passable rating, clearly the lead character put in a lot of work into it and it shows!"
tt29538571,6.0,"Stupid story, stupid characters, stupid music, stupid Berlin. Stupid film? Maybe, but one that's fun in a certain way. The title says it all, it's all about and on the basis of this, the Netflix production at least manages to be an entertaining film that is easy to watch. John Wick 4 was watched as a warm-up for the probably watched more than once as a warm-up for filming, and probably again during, I'm just saying the scene in the club. Of course, this film is leagues below leagues below the great role models in all areas, but in the B-area it should certainly a good place in the B section.

tt14564000,5.0,"Guntur kaaram is a Telugu film directed by Trivikram, starring, Mahesh Babu, Sree Leela, Meenakshi and others.Director Trivikram, known for his writings and dialogues somehow failed this time to impress the audience and his true mark was missing. The film is a regular commercial film where the content can be seen rarely and the mass elements more. Being it, their 3rd venture
The fans kept their expectations too high and the result was initially decided too. When launched the glimpse, felt like a feast to the fans and enough for them to get into it. Slowly, when the songs were released, people gave mixed reactions and music composer Thaman failed to generate the vibe. And the post trailer launch moments were wild as the expectations dropped and people felt routine. Now, when the movie is all ours, we are set in a dilemma, whether to accept it or not. Trivi's storytelling this time may not be satisfying.Story is the same old faded one, where the lead Ramana (Mahesh Babu) is disowned by his mother and called again by her as the situation persists , he leads there, and helps her with the work needed. Entire film contains his journey from Guntur to Hyderabad and nothing else. Few conversations are created between the leads just to keep us engaged. The love track was kind of lovable yet, drags the screenplay. The interval has no bang and fails to create interest. And, in the 2nd half, the comedy, fights and the family drama were shown properly and has a good amount of mixed emotions in it. That's it, nothing else to be expected. This definitely has the ability to be liked by the families as the main aim is to satisfy them. Trivikram's movies have a great repeat value. Ex, Khaleja, Athadu, Jalsa. Now this is quite contrary to it .The only positive is Mahesh Babu. He is finally back in his vintage form. Watching him act naturally brings cheers among the audience. The mannerisms and dialogue delivery stands best and having no social message should be the prime reason for audience to book the tickets. He literally gave his best, watching bob and Sree Leela dance together gives so much of high. But, Meenakshi chowdhary's character was unnecessary and this exactly reminds me of trivi saying "" akkada space ledhu, space create chesukunnam"".Thaman' s bgms were quite energetic but as said earlier, the vibe was missing. DOP Manoj Paramahamsa's work was definitely impressing. Overall, this film is that type of film which is released just for the sake of a release and to give a comeback. Though the comeback by MB is satisfactory, Trivikram and Naga Vamsi (producer) are the ones responsible for the bombing of this film. It's a forceful Sankranti release, just to entertain families and to chill in theaters. The price hike of rs 115 was definitely not needed.Truly, a good watch for the dhfms and the familes. This sankranti Atmos is a ride of vintage bob and definitely a whole new experience."
tt6906292,5.0,"Of course there was no doubt about me having to sit down and watch this 2023 action crime thriller as it had Liam Neeson on the cast list. Sure, I had never even heard about the movie prior to watching it, not that it really mattered, as it was a Liam Neeson movie.The storyline in ""Retribution"", as written by Alberto Marini and Christopher Salmanpour, sort of was very similar to the 1994 movie ""Speed"", except that it was lacking the high speed and adrenaline. It was watchable, for sure, but it was not a top notch movie for Liam Neeson. The storyline was a bit too much of a copy and paste of ""Speed"", except it was in a SUV and had a slightly different plot.The acting performances in the movie were good, and while Liam Neeson didn't have a particular set of skills in ""Retribution"", then he still carried the movie well enough to make it a watchable movie. There are a couple of other familiar faces on the cast list, with the likes of Embeth Davidtz, Matthew Modine, and Jack Champion.I found ""Retribution"" to be somewhat lacking in thrills and excitement, and the movie's plot and storyline was a tad too linear and predictable for my liking. Plus, the fact that if you've already seen ""Speed"", then you have essentially also already seen director Nimród Antal's ""Retribution"".Watchable for what it was, ""Retribution"" didn't impress me, nor did it revolutionize the action crime thriller genre. In fact, it didn't bring anything new at all to the genre. And on that account, my rating of director Nimród Antal's ""Retribution"" lands on a bland five out of ten stars."
tt6906292,6.0,"Retribution is barely for those of us who fell in love with Neeson when he did the ultimate man meal Taken. Ever snice That trilogy I've been running to the theatres to watch Neeson flicks and this is the Frist time I actually said to myself why (which i now found surprising).Not to say this was a bad movie, but it really seemed unnecessary. Wild thing, it feels like a similar plot to a better Neeson movie the Commuter. The movies may seem polarizingly deferent but if you seen The Commuter you'll notice the same plot devices creating the same loop holes in both, but the Commuter is worth seeing while i could have skipped Retribution altogether."
tt6906292,5.0,"Retribution (2023) :
Movie Review -Retribution Movie Review: Nimród Antal's action thriller Retribution sees Liam Neeson take the lead role. Based on the Spanish flick ""El desconocido"" (2015), Retribution restores all the original elements but seems too soft for today's audiences. Actually, remaking a 2015 flick that hasn't gotten a high repeat value or universal acclaim wasn't a good idea in the first place, but technically it was a safe bet. The script did not demand a huge budget, long hours, or any transformations, so it sums things up quickly. That's easy, but somebody has said the right thing: ""Easy is boring"". You need something exciting and thrilling just to add one more layer to your decent watch, and the product should land safely. Retribution gets to that decent point, but not to that one extra layer.Retribution revolves around bank financier Matt Turner (Liam Neeson), who is more busy at work than his family. He thinks everything's alright with his wife, son, and daughter, but it isn't. One day, Matt is off to leave his children at school in a car, and he receives an anonymous call on a cellphone that has been left inside and is told that a bomb has been placed under each of the car's seats, set to explode if any of them leaves their seated position. The unknown caller asks Matt to do everything he says, and as we all know, he wouldn't give easy tasks. From money scams to murder, framing, and destroying one's identity, Matt's life is turned upside down. Can he get it back and save his children?Retribution is a wannabe revenge drama that hardly has any sensible revenge theories. On the positive side, it is a very engaging hostage drama. You might have seen hostess dramas set in a godown, room, or house, but never inside a car. Retribution scores high in those attributes. One can feel the pressure that's built inside the vehicle and the way those three characters and one horrible voice behave. What goes wrong is the shortening process. The best thing about Retribution is that it's pacy and short, and the worst thing is that it's too short for a complete feature film experience. Predictability is caused by the remake factor, but it wouldn't be there for first-timers. The script has completeness intellectually but is incomplete as a thrilling ride. A little bit of extension to the storyline would have made a good difference.Talking about performances, Retribution is all about Liam Neeson's acting finesse. This man suits the age, look, and personality of the character, but more than that, it's his own charisma that makes it look better. ""I can't,"" says Matt, dropping his gun. Watch out for Neeson's expression and the situational brilliance provided by him. Noma Dumezweni shines in that one particular scene when she has a conversation with Matt, aka Liam. Matthew Modine will surprise you, despite limited screen space, while Embeth Davidtz underperforms, unexpectedly. The supporting roles of Lilly Aspell, Jack Champion, Arian Moayed, and others are somewhat noticeable.Retribution's strength lies in its screenplay, even though the storyline is a bit pulpy. El desconocido showed the protagonist in a bad light as a dishonest person, while Retribution is way too mild in presenting the hero. It derives a lot from the sympathetic image of the hero, as we see his children and even the cops being too supportive towards him. It's generous and lovable occasionally-not fully, though. The technical aspects are okay, with a special mention to the background score. Flavio Labiano's camerawork is fine, and Steven Mirkovich's editing doesn't let you have a nap. Nimród Antal's return to the movies after 7 years may be alright, but I still prefer that aggressive Antal from Predators (2010). Moviemaking is far different now, so he must update himself. It's mandatory when you are remaking a so-so one-time film. Retribution is a one-time watch too, but how many people prefer that nowadays?RATING - 5/10*"
tt6906292,5.0,"Shallow is the best word I can come up with. This is the worse character script writing I've seen for any Liam film but it is still a passable film (barely). Lots of stereotyping about the kids, wife, cops and much of the supporting cast. A few holes in the storyline, too. However, if you're a Liam fan, you'll get through it. The editing was actually pretty good but there are lots of gaps that have you wondering ""what's taking so long?"". I think this could have been 2-3 stars better with some decent writing and less predictability with many of the characters. It was just very shallow and Liam deserves a lot better."
tt6906292,5.0,"I went into this not knowing anything about it; I didn't know it was a remake nor what the plot is. Turns out, it's a contained thriller that's quite well-paced, managing to wring enough tension and suspense out of its simple premise with strong editing.Neeson and some of the other cast members really do give it their all, and they bring life to the film that makes up for the bland direction and cinematography.While most of the time the movie is compulsively watchable, what really holds it back is the script. It's bad.It's a strange kind of bad that really does feel like this screenplay was generated by ChatGPT. Nearly all of the dialogue is stilted and generic, and the story moves kind of haphazardly, as though a machine were calculating what was the next appropriate action movie plot point to throw in next.I guess it's better than many of the other beige action flicks Neeson has churned out over the years, but it's still far from good."
tt3480822,6.0,"After all these years, Black Widow finally gets her own standalone movie and... it's okay. I actually found Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz to be entertaining additions, but the story felt cobbled together and it was riddled with plot holes. I know Natasha is a very skilled assassin, for instance, but she's almost invulnerable in this. It probably would have been better to give Black Widow her solo film a year or two after Iron Man 2 came out."
tt3480822,6.0,"Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson) must deal with a villain from her past and her long-absent family.LOUD, confusing and far too long. It starts off OK but quickly falls apart and becomes confusing and convoluted. The film is also way too long--it doesn't need to run over 2 hours. There's also tons of CGI at the end--way too much. The acting is OK. In short a long forgettable MCU movie."
tt3480822,5.0,"...Average filmmaking.Here are few words which can describe this film:
Unnecessary
Uninteresting
DisappointingRe-watch another marvel film to shake off the dullness after you are done with black widow.I m not saying don't watch it; but once you do, you will know!By the way my reviews for black widow here keep getting deleted.So here's another one..."
tt3480822,6.0,"Florence Pugh carried this movie, her and David Harbour laid down some seriously good comedic moments. The action was as over the top as any other marvel movie so on brand there.

tt3480822,6.0,"Marvel: You're finally getting your own movie.Scarlet: Oh' Really?Marvel: As long as it'll be used as a backstory of our future Avenger in Phase4.Scarlet: whatever? What's my Paycheck ?!?Honestly, I watched the whole thing without being getting bored due to sheer talent onscreen not due to writing or direction. However, the moment i finished, I instantly forgot as well. Problem with Marvel is that once everything you put out becomes a brand. They see storylines as how it can move their other movies like Phase4 or show Hawkeye here. It doesn't serve the story or character you're watching atall. Everything has to connect to something in the future. The untimely forced humour and video games like CGI in the end has become cringing but hey I watched it for free so no complaints."
tt3480822,5.0,"I would never label a Marvel film as ""uninteresting"" (except for the first two ""Thor"" installments) but this needless chapter gets close.While the MCU has never revolutionized the wheel in terms of storytelling, there at least has always been a sense of discovery and progression. ""Black Widow"" only spins its wheels doling out the same tired formula that has continually plagued the solo installments of the ever-expanding universe.Director Cate Shortland embraces the spy genre but doesn't offer anything interesting with the unlimited budget and talent at her disposal, with her greatest sin being the absolute wasting of Ray Winstone as one of the most pathetic MCU villains (already a low bar to begin with).Fortunately, the introduction of Florence Pugh as Yelena offers some semblance of hope in this new age of heroes."
tt0073650,6.0,"Speak the name in some circles and you'll be greeted with cries of derision and condemnation. In others, you'll be told it's one of the most important, powerful films ever made. There may be no movie so infamous or so hotly contested as Pier Paolo Pasolini's last film 'Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom.'Inspired by 'The 120 Days of Sodom, or the School of Libertinage' by the Marquis de Sade, the film is set in Italy during WWII and follows four fascists named The Duke, The Magistrate, The President and The Bishop. Alongside their barbaric troupe of acolytes, they put a group of eighteen children through a Dantesque cycle of torture and perversion.Completely unremitting in its' depiction of depravity and offering the viewer no respite from scenes of brutality at any point during its' runtime, the film makes for a fascinatingly violent viewing experience that is uncomfortable and unforgettable.It may be easier to start discussing the definitive positive elements of the movie. The cinematography and shot construction is undeniably beautiful and artistic. The images on screen are strange, perverse and off-putting, but captured with style and skill behind the camera- a credit to the work of cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli. The stirring soundtrack makes effective use of pieces by Chopin, Bach and others, while Ennio Morricone's original score is haunting.The film also benefits from having a cast full of dedicated, brave performers, whose work lingers in the mind long after the film has ended. The actors playing the four fascist libertines are all outlandishly, disgustingly terrific, with Giorgio Cataldi and Aldo Valetti being particularly memorable as The Bishop and The President respectively. As one of their accomplices, Hélène Surgère also does admirable work, but it's hard to appreciate the performances when the characters are so detestable and despicable and the actions they perform so thoroughly base.This is the problem with the whole film actually: it's hard to appreciate because Pasolini was so committed to showing the audience nothing but cruelty. 'Salò' could be seen as an allegory about the corrupting effect of absolute power, of the extreme savagery man is capable of when they have no inhibitions, shame or empathy. By showing us nothing but repetitive scenes of torture to illustrate this theme, though, the film seems a little cursory in its' examinations of same. A cynical critic might say it's a very one-note movie, that note being one of sadism, pain and disgust.On the other hand, one might say that it is important for artists like Pasolini to hold truth to power in their work. While the film is based on the writings of the Marquis de Sade, by updating the film to a WWII setting, Pasolini can make commentary on the barbarism of the fascists during that war.When the allies were liberating concentration camps, lampshades made with human skin were found. The twisted, unnecessarily cruel experiments Dr. Josef Mengele performed on children are well documented, as well as other countless acts of sadism undertaken by the fascists who enjoyed absolute power at the time.One could say Pasolini is giving us an account of the viciousness that took place during WWII that cannot be forgotten or obfuscated by history- the film will always be around to remind us of where humanity went wrong. Except, 'Salò' is largely confined to an isolated mansion, which sets the proceedings apart from the war or real life. This gives the film an odd, otherworldly feeling that in turn makes trying to contemporize or understand in in a real-world context incredibly difficult and somewhat pointless, even if that is what Pasolini intended.Say what you will about 'Salò', it does make you think and will certainly make you feel something- it is a visceral and intellectual experience. It's also a thoroughly uncomfortable one, featuring nearly two hours of torture and sexual perversion with no break for the viewer from the unceasing depravity whatsoever. It's not a film someone will say they enjoyed- and if they do be wary of that person- but it can be somewhat rewarding.It is certainly unique and deserves its' infamous reputation as one of the most challenging pieces of cinema ever made. It is a film that will likely provoke different reactions from everyone who sees it- some will hate it and others will hail it as a masterpiece.There are those of us whose feelings about the film are constantly in flux, who think they can see what Pasolini intended but don't think his ideas were expressed as eloquently as they could have been. Whatever the case and whatever your feelings are on the film, 'Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom' is an uncompromising journey into a world of depravity that is sure to leave an indelible impression on the viewer."
tt0073650,6.0,"With Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salo,"" the long-disputed issue of the extent to which a filmmaker can interpret a story on screen has been put to the ultimate test.And when ""extreme"" cases do happen, do the censors become ""morally"" justified in interfering with the filmmaker's ""creative freedom""?There are a good number of films that can be used to illustrate the issues raised:Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""Santa Sangre"" can be a case in point regarding the subject of violence and gore (a mentally-disturbed serial murderer and his domineering mother, with surreal images and subtle attacks on the Catholic faith),while Nagisa Oshima's ""In the Realm of the Senses"" can be a point of reference regarding the subject of sex and nudity (a couple---a geisha and a tradesman---who has practically made sexual intercourse the be-all and end-all of their lives, to the point of obsession and possessiveness).On the other hand, Pasolini's film shows both ""flesh and blood.""The opening credits, with the accompaniment of a soft-sounding music, and the opening shot of a calm body of water, with a palace (turns out to belong to the high officials) viewed from afar, are deceiving:what follows from thereon is definitely not soothing to one's senses.Set in World War II Italy, where Benito Mussolini's Nazi-Fascist regime is very much in power, the film depicts the ways in which the dictator's high-standing minions are capable of degrading and brutalizing the citizens,particularly the youth, just to satisfy some perverted and homo-erotic desires.The film is divided in four parts (or ""chapters,"" if one may call them so, since the film, it's significant to say, is based on a novel by Marquis de Sade, a controversial and provocative man of letters during his time),where each one represents the stages in which the young, innocent and gentle are deliberately and systematically corrupted and destroyed by the supposed-to-be leaders and guardians of the state---it's like hungry wolves feeding on gentle lambs.""Antechamber of Hell"" shows how a number of young people, most of them beautiful and fresh, are rounded up, brought to the palace and oriented with the ""rules and regulations"" that are to govern their existence within the chamber of power---upon hearing them, one gets the impression that this might just be what hell really is.""Circle of Obsessions"" has the state officials weaving tales of eroticism and sensuality to arouse themselves and the youth into making some of the most perverted sexual acts---unabashed nudity, autoeroticism, hedonism, lasciviousness and homoeroticism are strewn all over.""Circle of Shit"" illustrates a further debasement:feeding on others' and one's own excrement (there's even a scene where one of the officials lets a young woman urinate right into his mouth) as, if I understand it right, a gesture of wholly accepting the ""evil"" in all of us---the ""stench,"" to be taken literally and figuratively.The images may truly repel the viewers:a graphic act of defecation, close-up shots of feces (and what a heap!) and the notoriously unforgettable mock wedding reception.Finally, ""Circle of Blood"" takes the viewers to ""salo""---the punishing ground, where the young boys and girls who broke some of the ""rules and regulations"" are ""taught their lesson"" by the men in power.Again, this part is excruciating to watch, for the viewers become witness to some of the most brutally painful acts of punishment:how about an eye being removed, just to give a sample?Now, was Pasolini ""guilty"" of, to use film critic Leonard Maltin's words, ""wallowing in his own sensationalism""? I've yet to read the book on which the film is based, but someone told me that the Italian filmmaker was just being faithful to De Sade's work.Meaning to say, Pasolini tried as much as possible to express visually what the French novelist expressed in words.True, ""Salo"" in its entirety is an extremely offensive and shocking film, the kind to which the moviegoing adage ""Just sit back and relax"" won't definitely apply.But then, isn't that the kind of response that the film's theme and images should elicit from the viewers in the first place?Not to be disoriented and enraged by the lowest depths into which man's (ab)use of power and satisfaction of primitive cravings and desires can plunge is one of the most absurd things that can ever happen.We should really appreciate artists (directors, novelists, poets, etc.) who have the courage and commitment (an abundance of them, it must be) to explore ""extreme possiblities"" inherent in human life.Life isn't always like ""a box full of chocolates""---sweet and comforting---is it?If it ever happens that ""the people concerned"" get alarmed, raise concerns about a film and eventually mangle, if not ban, it, it may only prove that the film hits right where it should."
tt0073650,6.0,"disturbing. this is the basic conclusion about the last film by Pasolini. denunciation of fascism and bourgeoisie. a masterpiece. last fight of Pasolini against his demons. disgusting. a trash. demonstration of madness. chaotic and boring and scatological. for me, it is only the end of a way. a kind of verdict. after a career in search of truth and beauty and the measure. Salo is a social and political manifesto. attack against hypocrisy and denunciation of the traces of fascism. a film as a form of exorcism. cruel and honest and hopeless. but, after 40 years, it is perceived in different manner. its message is suffocated by the violence of images. the temptation to discover it as portrait of consumerism is covered by the forms of eroticism. and about the waves of prejudices. it is a Pasolini. the last. this is only important thing. the rest - manifestation of personal perceptions."
tt0073650,6.0,"...meaning that if a viewer can stay tuned, as I could, through the ""Circle of Sh*t"" segment, then a viewer can sit through just about anything that's on celluloid. It's indeed appropriate that it's called the most disturbing and disgusting film ever made, as it well could be. As I watched all the way through till the end I got the same feeling as I did watching Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. Both films go out on a limb with excesses (although Gibson's excesses were arguably not as faithful to the source as Pasolini was), and I have to say that at least from an objective point of view Pier Paolo Pasolini gets the job done there. With great cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli (Once Upon a Time in the West) providing the sometimes exquisite camera-work and lighting, Ennio Morricone delivering a slight, but melodic tone in the background, and with interesting sets, plus an interesting editing style that doesn't entirely show as much of the grotesque and sex as it could've, the craft behind the film is pretty good. If one were to look past the subject matter, it's actually a very well constructed piece of film art, which is why many consider it important.I suppose it's a unique film, but you couldn't pay me to want to watch it again (unless it was in a film class where the teacher proved himself to have reason to have us watch it). At the core, Salo: 120 Days of Sodom, is interesting as a concept, from which it was taken from Sade's novel - a group of f*cked up fascists during the end of world war two capture some young boys and girls and force them to go under sexual and mental tortures. As in the book (which I've never read and don't really have a desire to seek out at this point in my life), the acts are relentless, and in between the fascists instilling fear and intense degradation, a woman narrates stories that go over and over as she describes everything from eating excrement to helping out a grown man in diapers. By the end, it's a controlled chaos as most are dead and those who aren't look on with binoculars. Now, the problem is with this material, at least for me, it becomes very subjective.I can see the core point PPP's making (it's almost like a twisted satire), and it does remind me how much fascism is the worst kind of ideology there is on Earth...But then the relentlessness of it all becomes very, very close to unbearable (i.e. endurance test). And, reminding me again of 'The Passion', Salo doesn't give any of the characters any other kinds of emotions to work in than those they're stuck with. There's no deviating from the paths and fates of the characters, and without any point of entry into the victims (the exclusion being two girls, who all they say are 'I can't take this anymore' to each other), they're left with the controlled state that the villains have put them in. I suppose the acting by these four, vicious bastards is commendable, but after a while the acts that they thrust upon the kids stops being shocking, and becomes boring. And when a film that is supplied with a talented crew and cast that does whatever PPP tells them to do, and it's boring, it doesn't work for me. The stories by the one woman, in-particular, tend to drag on as her character seems to just think up new ways to entice the heads of the manor into ecstasy. On top of this, there isn't logic to history because if this is towards the end of the war, where are the allies putting a stop to the fascists?I guess, in the end, I found Salo to be one of the more difficult films I've ever seen. I know I'm sort of glad I got through with it, but by the end I realized that PPP committed a bit of a film crime (though certainly not deserving of his mysterious death before the film was released) - there's no room for catharsis. This could be argued by some, however I'd have to say that if there was one it was buried underneath all of the sh*t food and *ss raping. Because the film is a bit one-dimensional, and hope is a lost cause, by the end all one could reasonably be left with is emptiness. In a way it reminded me of Bergman's Cries and Whispers in how it's just a sea of bleakness and despair for everyone involved, but at least in Bergman's bleak world there are moments of sweet (if maybe brief) humanity and love. I can't recommend Salo except for extreme, die-hard film buffs and for nihilistic types (and maybe for those interested in understanding the nature of fascism), and for those looking for what's worse after Gibson's POTC. It's definitely deserved, either way you take the film, as one of the most notorious, soul-churning pieces ever produced, though I wouldn't say it's one of the worst."
tt0073650,6.0,"This is on the list of most disturbing movies ever. But it's not disturbing for the sake of it. There is an underlying exposition of a fascist government and it's ability to control to the most depraved extremes. I don't need to go into the plot, just don't watch if your skin crawls easily.Apparently based loosely on the Marquis de Sade's eponymous story, it feels dirty...it feels icky. You will not finish the film feeling happy, relieved, redeemed, or satisfied. You will feel that humanity is capable of terrible things and sometimes for no real reason other than they can. It shows what happens when people blindly follow terrible people and abandoned their own sense of decency. The following orders defense will never work. When you've become an accomplice you ate equally guilty.This movie has depth, but it's not an easy watch. It's not for a simple eve with a date. I can't imagine watching this with anyone other than fellow film students or a significant other you've been with for years."

They really need to give them some more funny stuff to do. They need to spread some of the stupid and silly stuff around. It works better with the bromance.

tt2274648,6.0,"A new remake made with nice panache based on the known comicbook , here the central figure is a grouchy, ironical, gun-toting half-human devil with a giant right arm and woman problems, being caught up between the worlds of the human race and supernatural . A thinking person's creature graced with incredible force and irony. Hellboy : David Balfour, is son of a fallen angel who came to our world in 1944 as a result of a mythical and magical ritual presided by Rasputin, the famous Russian monk . As our bouncing friend crawled into this world from another dimension during WWII. As the occultists of the third Reich invoked the demon from the hell, but then he fell into the claws of the American military. As Hellboy began to serve them by protecting the world from horrible and weird threats. Heartful horror is Neil Marshall's stock in trade with lots of noisy action, battles, thrills, chills and abundant special effects. There Hellboy is assigned to a dangerous mission, being sent to Great Bretain and fighting an eternal evil that currently manifiests itself in the form of Merlin's wife, Nimue : Milla Jovovich .As Hellboy meets face to face the heinous magician woman carrying out a lethal confrontation. Along the way Hellboy is supported by other colleagues from the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense and friends, such as Alice Monaghan : Sasha Lane, Major Ben Daimio : Daniel Dae Kim, Lady Hatton : Sophie Okanedo and his doctor, adopted father Ian McShane .As they battle an ominous witch who awakes from ancient times.Stars David Harbour as Hellboy whose interpretation is similar the former ones played by Ron Perlman. David plays him as an anti-hero, a blue-collar guy, happier eating and joking that fighting evil. This wisecracking, cigar-chomping hunk role results to be a crossover among Humphrey Bogart, Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood. The film rips through an opening prologue explaining his origin. Relishing absurdities and incoherences, filmmaker get on with the business of fast and furious amusement, racking up sequences with breathtaking set pieces against elaborate, urban-occult backdrops. This is third retelling , former ones directed by Guillermo del Toro : ""Hellboy"" 2004 with Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, John Hurt, Karl Roden, Rupert Evans, Jeffrey Tambor, Doug Jones and ""Hellboy, The Golden Army"" 2008 with Perlman, Selma Blair, Luke Goss, James Dodd, John Alexander , Seth McFarlane.Director Marshall fuses the fabulous imagination by means of several monsters and the irreverent wit and comicbook action of Hellboy. As this great red-skinned, trenchcoated hero is pitched into a class between adopted human world and an underworld of trolls, fairies, witches and all of them fighting againt a giant warhog, and a witch bent on vengeance .There is also a heartful plea for bio and cultural diversity.It contains a colorful and glimmer cinematography by Lorenzo Senatore. As well as moving and thrilling musical score by Benjamin Wallfisch. The motion picture produced by Milennium Films was well directed by Neil Marshall, though it has some flaws and gaps, being justly inferior to two previous renditions. Marshall is good Brit craftsman, expert on action, sci-fi and terror movies as Dog soldiers, The descent, Doomsday, Tales of Halloween, The reckoning. And he has directed episodes of notorious series as Constantine, Game of thrones, Timeless, Hannibal, Westworld, Lost in space. Rating 5.5/10. Passable and acceptable recounting."
tt2274648,6.0,"HELLBOY is the third instalment of the filmed comic book franchise, sadly lacking the magnificent presence of director Guillermo del Toro who is replaced by likeable B-movie stalwart Neil Marshall. Unfortunately Marshall didn't contribute the script, which is undoubtedly the weakest thing about this generic offering, and despite copious amounts of his trademark gore and bloodshed, this is a film that doesn't amount to much. Ron Perlman didn't come back either, and David Harbour is a weak imitation, his Hellboy lacking singularly in charisma and feeling more like a heavy metal band member more than anything else. The film offers endless spectacle and action heavily dominated by CGI effects, but the mish-mash of plot and forced humour, while watchable, doesn't have the same love and care that went into the two prior films. Put it this way: I can happily re-watch either of those, but I won't be re-watching this one."
tt2274648,5.0,"517 A.D.: King Arthur defeats the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) with the help of his trusty magical sword Excalibur, chopping her into pieces and burying her still-living body parts in the far reaches of the land. 1500 years later, changeling Gruagach (voiced by Stephen Graham) pieces the queen back together so that she can destroy mankind and rule the Earth with monsters as her loyal subjects. Hellboy (David Harbour) is given the job of preventing this from happening.The majority of fans and critics gave this film hell on its release. So what did it do to deserve such damnation?For many, the simple fact that it wasn't directed by Guillermo Del Toro and didn't star Ron Perlman was enough to demonise the movie, but even overlooking the change of director and leading man, there is still plenty to dislike: the creature-filled action scenes are over-reliant on unrealistic CGI; the comedy frequently mis-fires; Daniel Dae Kim and Sasha Lane are lousy as Hellboy's sidekicks; and the plot is rather scattershot. Oh, and there's a REALLY bad ectoplasmic Ian McShane.Having said that, there is also quite a lot to enjoy: the R-Rating allows for plenty of graphic gore (although, sadly, much of it is also digital); there are some delightfully absurd moments (Hellboy's encounter with hideous witch Baba Yaga, who lives in a house on giant chicken legs, is excellent, and Eastenders fans will enjoy seeing Mo Harris brandishing a machine gun); the links to Arthurian legend are fun, and apparently make the film more faithful to the comics than Del Toro's movies; and director Neil Marshall occasionally shows us what he is really capable of (the single-shot fight scene in a Siberian complex at the end of the film is wonderful).All in all, a very mixed bag of a movie: not the completely hellish experience that I had heard it was, but far from great."
tt2274648,5.0,"Although the effort of the director and the talent of the actors, the movie lacks the charm of the Guillermo del Toro duology. The movie is way more faithful to the comics but it also tries to be faithful to the previous movies (which every reboot should try to be) but it just becomes a mess of attempts.
The CGI is overused- WHEN WILL STUDIOS LEARN!- and although the creatures design is very interesting, pretty much every character lacks the dept the old duology provided.
At the end of the day Hellboy(2019) is just another failed reboot that tries to be it's own thing while respecting the previous movies.
My rating?
5 out of 10, but I do agree with the 61% rating on rotten tomatoes because the movie isn't all crap, there's a charm to it but it's not enough to make you overlook it's flaws.
Just watch the Guillermo del Toro duology, it's a far superior franchise, and I would of loved to see the third movie if the studios didn't cancelled it.
If you are interested in the director Neill Marshall (which despite the failed attempt of rebooting Hellboy is a damn good director) go watch Dog Soldiers which is criminally underrated.
See you next time at the movies,
Ruben the Critic"
tt2274648,6.0,"Although the trailer & even poster had more spoilers than you could possibly believe, & the casting switch takes a bit to get used to, this new 'soft' reboot IS Hellboy in EVERY WAY, SHAPE & FORM!
Even without Del Toros creature shop, the digital characters & translations from the Hellboy comic were on point, interesting & terrifying.
The R rating, is probably the movies biggest flaw- excess swearing & SUPER graphic violence seem unnecessary & is probably a box office mistake for a paranormal action movie that kids would absolutely love.
Except for the origin briefly retold, it seems like JUST another great Hellboy adventure more than a reboot, being so close to the first two movies that Del Toro & Pearlman could EASILY come back with a sequel in a years' time & it not hurt whatsoever.
While skeptical to begin with I completely warmed up to it in very short time- fun, gross, crazy & very likable."
tt1034415,6.0,"I've seen the original and can tell that this remake goes one step further. While the old 'Suspiria' from 1977 has strong atmospheric suspense, his one has less of it, but becomes real bloody at the end. What drives me mad is the run time. 2 hours 31 minutes for a story that could be easily told in 1 hour 45 minutes. So I lost a lot of time for a mediocre story. I would have given even a worse rating, if it wouldn't get so gory shocking scenes at the end. That's the only point it can really score with - as a horror movie. The story is too long winded."
tt1034415,6.0,It's 1977 Berlin in an atmosphere of political terrorism. Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson) is a wide-eyed amateur new to the free avant-garde Tanz Dance Academy. Former dancer Patricia Hingle disappeared and her psychiatrist Josef Klemperer reads her journals. Tilda Swinton plays multiple characters.This is about three quarter grind and a quarter amaze balls. The grind is a lethargic slow procession. Dakota is also lethargic and struggles to be the lead. Her 50 shades acting has infected this movie. She barely stands out in the sea of wraithlike dancers. It's weird and arthouse beautiful. It's meandering. It's a real grind except when it's amaze balls. The first contortion kill is crazy and good and crazy good. It is visually aggressive and artful. It's new and everything I want from this movie. It's also the best the movie ever gets. There are some good moments after that but they don't exceed it. I can see how some may like the arthouse horror aspect but I suspect that more will not like the slow grind. It's two and a half hours and I wouldn't mind cutting out a good half hour out.
tt8244784,6.0,"A familiar but efficient action comedy with an extremely brisk pacing and some good satire aimed squarely at American politics. There's an anything goes policy here with every political position a target and that makes for good humour, at least as far as I'm concerned. It's noticeably violent, kicking off with lots of shock deaths and scenes, before turning into a female-led revenge thriller towards the climax. Aside from Hilary Swank, most of the cast are unknown but they do a pretty good job here. It's not an amazing film but it did entertain me throughout."
tt8244784,6.0,"This movie was written to basically call everyone an idiot if they base their whole lives around politically based ideological garbage. It's saying that regardless of being far right or far left you're still basically the same breed of moron and that it's the people living in the middle, who are actually trudging away just living our lives, are the actual badasses. Well not me specifically, but the general ""we"". The people who ignore the extremes of politics and just get things done. This movie portrays that in the least subtle way possible and I thought it was pretty hilarious.There is almost no plot to this movie, which I'm sure will turn people off, but that's honestly what I liked about it because as commentary it speaks to political discourse that we see every day. It's all crap on both sides. Just buzz words and stupid conspiracy theories with both sides trying to paint each other into a box with very specific ideologies. Then we have the protagonist, a woman we know nothing about, nothing is ever explained about her, and she just takes over everything. It's all a very hamfisted analogy for modern society but I thought it was hilarious.The plot is dumb, the characters are disposable, you never know what's going to happen next, everyone is insulted by the end, and Betty Gilpin does a hilarious job of just being bizarre. She also shows off some of her skills she's developed from starring on GLOW and her body is crazy tight in this. This is overall just a silly, ridiculous, popcorn flick with gratuitous violence...which is exactly what we need in an overly charged political era. It's a 6 because it's no masterpiece or anything, but it's plenty enjoyable."
tt1029234,5.0,"...and what we're ultimately allowed to witness is, at its core, some pretty empty-headed, although visceral, existentially sadistic nonsense. Nonetheless, I can't deny that ""Martyrs"" packs a punch (several of them, in fact, to the face and gut, repeatedly, to its protagonist, after fooling us about who the real protagonist is). It's ultra-violence that Alex and his droogies would lap up like synthemesc milk-plus; presumably the audience is meant to as well. Aha, but auteur Pascal ""The Tall Man"" Laugier isn't through with us yet! After rubbing our collective noses in viscous pools of vengeance and hallucinatory blood guilt, he dials up the sadism a few more notches with a tiresome third act that trucks in absurdist fantasies of an elite cabal searching for proof of an afterlife through the inducement of a tortured martyr's vision of what can only be feebly represented by a coruscating white light.What tripe.Neither the acting chops of the two leads, which are considerable, nor the overall production values, including some very convincing Grand Guignol splatter and grue, can conceal the vacuous conceit of the film's plot nor the soul-less nihilism of its theme. ""Martyrs"" leaves its audience numbed by its brutality, but with precious little else, and ultimately comes off as mere torture-porn with a glib pretension of meaning. I won't say it's not worth watching, but be prepared to be unsatisfied. Mayhaps that was Laugier's intent; if so, his intentions were shallow and venal."
tt1029234,5.0,"Well lots of reviews so I don't write too much about the story. Imo the best part of Martyrs is the first half but after revealing of the ""truth"" behind all the torturing this movie got in my eyes some kind of comical. I mean the whole purpose/premise of torturing someone to transcendent him... Any neurologist or doctor could tell u what will happen after someone has to endure too much physically/psychological pain/trauma, and it certainly has nothing to do with the afterlife or other dimensions or what-ever, (you get a good shot of endorphines and maybe some dissociation etc.) So watching the beatings etc. I was the whole time asking myself in the 2nd part of that movie how so many people (a cult or whatever, looked like rich old ppl afraid of death and their servants or whatever) can be so dumb to believe they could get a insight of the life after death by torturing someone. The ""solution"" of this movie really sucks. So whats left!? A good slasher in the first half with some drama, after that we see something like Mel Gibsons The Passion of Christ. If I compare the torture scenes I got to say that The Passion of Christ is far far better - it got me far more emotionally involved (the pain of the mother watching her son being whipped etc). The torture scenes of Martyrs are in the given context some kind of a miss-kick - the motivation behind it is so unbelievable that I didn't get in any kind of sense emotionally involved. What I also don't understand is why the girl didn't try to strangle one of the captors with the chains - long enough they are. So what's left!? The actors did well (ofc a minus for me is all the French emotional tantrum), the camera works also fine. Verdict: not really bad but in no way a cinematic triumph or must-see."
tt11358390,6.0,"Last year, Nick Cage starred in a major theatrically released movie for the first time in over a decade. It was the pleasant surprise, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. I love it. And I hoped it would be the movie to bring him back to prominence. (Not that he ever left ;)So I was immediately excited to see a new Nick Cage movie, Renfield, in theaters. Not to mention I love vampires. And in many ways, this movie is exactly what I wanted. It's entertaining, over-the-top, and borderline outrageous. I laughed a bunch, both at the comedy and at the craziness/gore. There is one scene near the end that perfectly captures the absurd fun (at the apartment complex).At the same time, those crazy and outrageous scenes make up a very small portion of this movie. And overall, it's not put together very well. The story doesn't feel smooth. Seems more... frantic. Same with the action. It's not bad, but it's a little... frantic. Same with the movie as a whole. I could tell as soon as it started. It's kind of... hectic.I was still able to get a lot of enjoyment out of Renfield. Cage gives a great performance. Six stars is a positive score for me. I had a good time and I'll probably watch it again at some point. But for a theatrical Nick Cage vampire movie, I can't help but be a bit disappointed. I should have LOVED this.On to the next. I was already watching most of his movies when they were low quality streaming movies. You better believe I'm watching all Cage theatrical movies. More crazy and weird stuff, please :)(1 viewing, early screening 4/12/2023)"
tt11358390,6.0,"I usually find Nicolas Cage's special brand of crazy either hugely entertaining (Face/Off, Mom & Dad) or gutwrenchingly awful (Willy's Wonderland, Mandy, Prisoners of the Ghostland), with not much middle ground. In Renfield, the star is on cracking form, his version of the iconic vampire being absolutely hilarious. Unfortunately, this is a film about Dracula's familiar, Renfield (Nicholas Hoult), and so Cage doesn't get nearly enough screen time.Most of the film sees Renfield attempting to break free of his master's control, while proving his worth to cop Rebecca (the awful Awkwafina, who is fast becoming a reason for me NOT to see a film); this involves the vampire's familiar taking on a gang of ruthless criminals led by a woman with a voice deeper than the Marianas Trench (Barry White sounds high-pitched by comparison). It's reasonably fun nonsense, largely thanks to the extreme level of violence (although the bad CGI gore is inexcusable), but with Cage stealing every scene he is in, one sincerely wishes that the film was all about Dracula and not his sappy assistant.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for the bit where Renfield rips a guy's face off (or face.... off, as Cage would say)."
tt11358390,5.0,"I really wanted to like this one, I really did. Renfield starts off promisingly enough with Nicolas Cage & Nicholas Hoult superimposed into Tod Browning's 1931 Dracula and delves into the Dracula mythos. All good fun.Things take a turn when Awkwafina is introduced alongside a subplot about a dead cop dad and a gangster family called the Lobos. This is the movies biggest issue. I signed up to watch Nic Cage finally tackle Dracula. I got almost a supernatural buddy cop movie. Such a disappointment.Hoult and Cage are great in their roles and it's a real pity they aren't used in a better film. Awkwafina is fine and can be used well in the right material but this isn't it.There are some nice action scenes and some really funny moments, mostly involving Nicholas Hoult in his support group meetings (a real missed opportunity to be something more)."
tt21397580,6.0,"As far as Lovecraftian adaptations go...this one is pretty good (most are quite bad, mind you).Honestly, what would a Lovecraft adaptation be without a little cheese?Of course this is cheesy.It's too weird a tale to take itself too seriously.As it's about a bizarre, slightly incestual, love triangle.Between a boy, his ailing father, and cougar psychiatrist.Although, it quickly mutates into more of a love polyhedron, of sorts.As characters keep switching from body to body...with most ending up banging each other.In what is eventually revealed to be the works of an ancient curse.All-in-all, it's cheesy, twisted, entertaining fun.As all Lovecraft films should be.6 out of 10."

The happily married Beth is the unlikely suspect in a murder. She recounts how it all started. Out of the blue, Asa Waite (Judah Lewis) barges into her office and claims that his father Ephraim Waite (Bruce Davison) is trying to steal his body.This is a lesser horror on Shudder. There are some intriguing ideas and it has Heather Graham. Basically, it's following the Blumhouse formula of a low budget horror with a former A-list star. It does have some drawbacks. First, Graham has never been known for her great acting skills. The possession transfer scenes come off as a bit campy. The transfer process is a bit muddled. On the other hand, I really love the car reversing scene and the closing section has some compelling turns. This is a marginal fail case."
tt21397580,5.0,"Heather Graham is the successful psychiatrist ""Elizabeth"" who finds her daily routine interrupted by a visit from the seemingly paranoid ""Asa"" (Judah Lewis). Initially sceptical, she begins to become intrigued with his story that he is being persecuted by a man, on the phone, who is threatening him. Indeed one such call induces a sort of fit from the young man! A visit to his home, and she is hooked into a mystery that is somewhat reminiscent of ""Fallen"" (1998) as it turns our erstwhile respectable physician into someone reduced to some rather lively, impromptu, nookie before incarceration in a padded cell trying to convince her close friend ""Dr. Dani"" (Barbara Crampton) that she's not completely deranged. This starts off quite interestingly, with a solid effort from Lewis as the troubled youth - but as it progresses and it becomes clear to us just what is going on, the film begins to fall away and lose any potency. The last half hour is violent and brutal, but suffers from a lack of plausibility - in this or any other dimension - and it becomes repetitive and shows up the really mediocre quality of both the writing and the acting. It is watchable, if only for Lewis, but equally forgettable stuff."
tt21397580,6.0,"Didn't completely do it for me but on the bright side Judah Lewis reeeally did the most (perhaps served a little Chuck Bass?), and it had some lines that made me cackle:
""Demon octopus.. awesome 😒""
""Then I must've really wanted to F my old man"" 🤣Was definitely intentionally campy, 80's, soap opera-y, so don't go into it expecting a straight-forward or serious horror movie. I think it's important for critics to remember that horror is one of the only genres where people can get weird with it. It may not be your thing, and it may not be Oscar worthy, but just be glad the creativity is alive and happening.For fans of Malignant, Tales from the Crypt."
tt21397580,6.0,"In Suitable Flesh the makers of Re-Animator and From Beyond once again team up with Barbara Crampton to tell one of HP Lovecrafts's stories. On top of that a gorgeous looking Heather Graham is starring as our main protagonist Dr. Elizabeth Derby. Also you have Judah Lewis from The Babysitter movies who is playing an entirely different character in this. The movie looks visually good and has some great shots and also some trippy scenes. You have an interesting story with characters swapping bodies and therefore behaving like total lunatics. While I had my fun watching this I don't think that this movie will be remembered for long. I think it's rather forgettable but for this one time watch it definitely was decent enough. [5,5/10]"
tt21397580,6.0,"I recently viewed Suitable Flesh (2023) on Shudder. The plot revolves around a psychiatrist encountering a troubled young man who claims someone is attempting to seize control of his body. He expresses fear of his father and insists there's something inside him. As the psychiatrist aids him, she realizes that what's inside him might be fixated on entering her own body.Directed by Joe Lynch (Wrong Turn 2), the film stars Heather Graham (Boogie Nights), Judah Lewis (The Babysitter), Bruce Davison (X-Men), Barbara Crampton (From Beyond), and Johnathon Schaech (Prom Night).The movie introduces unique elements and a compelling premise that maintains viewer interest. Heather Graham's performance is solid, and although some circumstances feel more authentic than others, the fall scenes fall short. However, the kills, gore, and blood splatter are executed excellently. The cinematography adds a creative and enjoyable touch, and the unconventional resolution, not culminating in a happy ending, left me satisfied.In summary, Suitable Flesh possesses enough commendable aspects to warrant a watch, though it doesn't stand out significantly in its genre. I'd give it a 6/10 and suggest seeing it once."

It doesn't try to deliver anything extraordinary, instead it aims for a proper 90mins entertainer with a controlled budget and it almost succeeds. For a while, the entire body swapping is fun with a crazy baddie and desperate Elizabeth along with this being an erotic horror thriller. It does drag on in third act till that climax twist, predictable all along yet mostly serviceable. Overall, it makes up for a one time watch."
tt21397580,6.0,"When I saw the metascore I was really excited for the film. But when I read the first bad user reviews, I lost my joy and avoided the film. Then came the evening when I had nothing interesting to watch and after much deliberation I decided to give the film a chance. And I have to say, the film pleasantly surprised me in some ways. Heather Graham alone is worth a look and if you know Heather Graham, you know she's not afraid to show a little more of herself. She is also beautiful to look at and for her age she can be seen in nude scenes.I like actress Heather Graham and am always happy to see her in a film. She dares to do something, and if the script had a little more to offer, she could of course do more acting. Unfortunately, the story is not new and we already know it from some better horror films. Unfortunately you can't get much out of the story. If you know this beforehand, you can still watch the film once. The film seems rather exaggerated, funny and trashy
Horror comedy with some sex scenes that don't blow you away, but are still worth a watch because of Heather Gramma. The actors put in a little effort, but that's enough for an H. P. Lovecraft adoption that feels more like a comedy. I would have liked a little more blood in this film! And I have to say that the film was my first H. P. Lovecraft film and I had a bit of fun for a horror movie night. In the end, I didn't care enough to watch the film. I was also impressed by Joy Lynch's film work! Her directing style suited the film...but I still would have liked a bit more of a '70s look."
tt3079380,6.0,"Was a decent parody of typical spy films and has a few laughs. Jason Statham was definitely my favourite part, often making fun of characters he has played before. This genuinely made me laugh quite a few times.Rose Byrne as one of the villains was great as well. Overall the acting was quite good from everyone, nobody ruined any parts of the film with their performances. Some of the cinematography was good, nothing phenomenal though. However, some jokes did fall flat or were just over used. The film does try to parody spy films but ends up sticking to common tropes instead of commenting on them. I would think adding more commentary on these tropes would add to the comedic tone and maybe give more heart to it. But not every film needs to do this, definitely give it a chance, you may be surprised!"
tt3079380,6.0,"Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) is an unassuming, deskbound CIA analyst--and the unsung hero behind the Agency's most risked missions, she assists the good-looking, intrepid, debonair operative agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). But when her partner falls off the grid and another top agent is compromised, she volunteers to go deep undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent a global crisis when an atomic weapon is being smuggled and is threatening to use it unless getting a large amount of millions of dollars. Her boss (Alison Janney) accepts that she completes the assignment because there is no other volunteer or agent to execute it, and despite the strong opposition of the expert and proud agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham). Along the way, Susan takes on a powerful organization for world control and being only helped by her good friend, the office agent Nancy Artingstall (Miranda Hart). One of the guys, one of the spies!. She's finally getting some action!.The picture is the usual ¨spoof¨ or parody featured by a desk-bound CIA analyst who volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer when her beloved fellow agent falls to death. Melissa McCarthy (who got an Oscar nomination: Best Supporting Actress, Bridesmaids (2011)) continuing the spoof formula, this time as a crazed international agent, playing a similar lunatic character like her other films. The fatty, burly Melissa is very sympathetic as the brave, yet surprisingly accident-prone agent who leaves a trail of destruction in her wake. Melissa told that the film is the most physically taxing she has ever done. It is surrealist, hilarious, extreme and sometimes gross-out spy-movie with full of quirky roles, mayhem and lots of fun. There're gags each fifty seconds, the film is formed by innumerable comical set-pieces and a myriad of imaginative parodies where the wacky humor and laughs are continuous. ¨James Bond's¨ movies or ¨Leslie Nielsen's Spy Hard¨ may be the main spoof targets, though ¨Spy¨ is hardly frugal with its references. The entertainment and fun result to be the disconcerting messes, silly action pieces and other bewildering scenes in wich our starring becomes involved and in which smile to roar with laughter. Melissa is well accompanied by a likeable cast, such as: Jude Law as Bradley Fine, the Agency's star operative, Jason Statham as the conceited and foul-mouthed agent Rick Ford, Allison Janney as CIA Headquarters Head Elaine Crocker, Miranda Hart as her best friend Nancy, Rose Byrne as an ambitious smuggler in atomic weapons, Bobby Cannavale as a businessman long suspected to be linked to terrorists and Morena Baccarin as insulting Agent Karen Walker. Besides, there are several cameos and brief interventions from Will Yun Lee, 50 Cent, Richard Brake, Sam Richardson, Ben Falcone, and look for director Paul Feig himself as a drunken guest at Paris Hotel.As in any self-respecting spy movie, the film is well set in several European cities, such as: Budapest, Rome and Paris, though mainly shot in Hungary, being wonderfully photographed by cameraman Robert D. Yeoman. Adding a thrilling, evocative and suspenseful musical score by composer Theodore Shapiro. The motion picture was well directed by Paul Feig. This filmmaker is a hardcore fan of the Spy-genre, creating here a broad action comedy in that genre and outstanding the thriller scenes with plenty of humor. He wrote , directed and produced because he knew that no one would ever let him ever shoot a real James Bond movie himself. Paul Feig is an expert writer, producer and director who has worked as Television as Cinema, such as: Arrested Development (2003), The Office (2005), Weeds (2005), Nurse Jackie (2010), Rockefeller Plaza (2006), Heavyweights (1995), Unaccompanied Minors (2006), Bridesmaids (2011), The Heat (2013), Ghostbusters (2016), among others. The film will appeal to absurd and unruly comedy enthusiasts, as well as Melissa McCarthy fans. Rating. 6.5/10."
tt0337563,5.0,"The film ""13 Going on 30"" commenced with great promise, instilling high hopes for an extraordinary cinematic experience. Yet, while being a delightful and tender chick-flick, it fell short of delivering much substance. As the plot unfolded, the narrative progressively veered into silliness, leaving the viewer somewhat disenchanted. While there were a handful of humorous moments sprinkled throughout, they failed to elevate the overall impact of the movie, ultimately rendering it below par. Despite its initial allure, ""13 Going on 30"" failed to attain the heights of greatness it seemed capable of, and instead settled into a mediocre performance."
tt0337563,6.0,"It's impossible to imagine this film with anyone other than Jennifer Garner in the lead role - she shines so brightly and so brilliantly in every scene, elevating what would most likely have been a flat and shallow affair without the seemingly-effortless magic of her performance.  Not that the other players weren't good - Mark Ruffalo came off great here and the rest of the cast was fine, no problems with anyone, it's just that the story (or the telling of it) wasn't exactly  original or inspired. No matter, what with Garner lighting up the screen; she's a charmer alright, with her superb comic timing, her infectious warmth and her natural talent for making the audience care deeply about her - you can't learn these things in any acting school on any planet."
tt0337563,6.0,"In ""13 Going On 30"" Garner is a 13 year old with a guy best friend and an impossible dream of becoming one of her school's ""in"" crowd. She pulls a ""Rip Van Winkle"" and suddenly finds herself 15 years older, with boobs, and the editor of a glitz and glam NYC femme fashion magazine. The rest is a fun frolic about coming to grips with what is important in life...what's steak and what's just so much sizzle. Garner and Ruffalo work well as the leads in this good old family values bop flick which keeps the momentum up 'til the very warm and fuzzy end. An unabashed chick flick, ""13 Going On 30"" should be an enjoyable watch for teen females and anyone in the mood for a romcom who can still remember what it's like to be 13 going on 30. (B-)"
tt0337563,6.0,"Jennifer Garner plays Jenna, a 13-year-old girl who makes a wish to become older, and she finds herself thrust forward 17 years into the body of a gorgeous 30-year-old executive. Trying to discover what happened, she gets back in touch with her old high school friends, who've all lived 17 years of life, while she is still just a girl in the body of a woman.The plot is obviously similar to the movie Big and all the critics have already bothered to point that out. While 13 Going on 30 isn't as good or engaging as Big, it's still a decent film with a nice message. The movie works a lot better than it should because of Jennifer Garner. She's funny and she has a great personality. It also helps that she's having fun in the role and it's so hard to actually hate her because she plays a very likable character. Mark Ruffalo gives an okay performance, he was a little dull though. I don't think comedy is his best genre. There are also some fun performances from Andy Serkis and Judy Greer.The film was too cheesy and silly for me at times. For example, there was this one scene where Jennifer Garner is at a sleepover with all these little thirteen year old girls and she's telling them about her kissing experiences. After she does this, they all get up and start dancing. It was just so cheesy and annoying though girls will probably love that part. The movie is also pretty predictable. If you have seen the preview then you should know how things will end. The movie is pretty simple yet still entertaining. It's also a lot better than other similar films like Chasing Liberty and The Prince and Me. In the end, 13 Going on 30 is a decent, charming chick flick that should appeal to it's target audience.

tt0079501,6.0,"""Look, any longer out on that road and I'm one of them, a terminal psychotic, except that I've got this bronze badge that says that I'm one of the good guys.""Mad Max is all about vehicle fueled vengeance. A young Mel Gibson plays a lawman in a near-future, gang infested Australia. His encounters with a especially vile gang result in a deadly attack on his wife and infant son, and the last act of the movie focuses on his single-minded payback on those responsible.Mad Max is certainly low-budget, but the movie doesn't really suffer from it. It is dated, however, and so many movies with similar premises have been made in the last thirty years that this one doesn't make nearly as much of an impression now as it probably did back in 1979. Watching this is a near-requirement for fans of Mel Gibson, but for everyone else, it's a decent movie that should be seen more for its classic status than its current entertainment value."
tt0079501,6.0,"""Mad Max"" is one of those films that is on everyone's top film lists. Not only did it introduce us to Australian cinema, but also a young 21-year old newbie named Mel Gibson. ""Mad Max"" was dark, it was brooding, it was destructive, and it never gave us that glimmer of hope for humanity, but now - nearly 20 years later - does it still remain the classic that it started? Sure, it was impressive to watch the crash scenes, it was powerful to see the world through Mr. Miller's disturbed eyes, but is it re-watchable? Does it have the appeal to see new things throughout if watched and watched again? For me, the answer seemed to float near ""no"". While I loved what ""Mad Max"" represented, what it was - a full body of color and action - it wasn't something to be watched again and again. Gibson does a great job as Max, a man torn between the evils of the road and his personal philosophies. He begins as an ominous optimist, able to stop crime as it occurs on the streets, but then as his sense of normality is turned upside down, his ability to react and adapt is seen. The final moments, he has transformed from the man we were first introduced to into something quite terrifying. One could also compliment Mr. Miller's directorial outing, at times it felt a bit episodic with tough edits placed, but for the majority he told a deathly story with great ease and excitement. So, again, there is no arguing that ""Mad Max"" is an important film, one that I am glad to have finally seen, but once was enough. It seems to be lacking that re-watch excitement.But why has that conclusion been made? What makes ""Mad Max"" mediocre instead of powerful? It is hard to pinpoint the exact scene, but the sense of ""alright, I've seen it - now what"" was definitely present by the end. Yet, there were points that I just loved. Gibson was perfect. He was incredible as Max, and the world that Mr. Miller created was intense. The opening scene, the car crashes as our bearded villain just yelled ""Toecutter"" was fantastic. ""Mad Max"" has one of those openings that just pulls you in, that makes you excited to watch a film of this intensity, but then where do you go? Miller seemed to indicate that more car crashes, more violence, more cliché family drama would indicate a stronger film. At times he was right, his ability to create different scenes set across the same backdrop demonstrated his originality, but then there were times where it just felt recycled. One scene that stands out, is where our gang of bikers track down a couple that happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, they chase them down and demoralize them as Max and his partner find them - then, almost repetitively, it happens with Max and his girl later in the film. In this post-apocalyptic world, there seems to be no problem finding someone. Space seems to not be a problem. This was another unexplained moment - where the coincidence of discovering Max or finding the biker gang should have been more difficult. These repetitive, essentially simplistic scenes seemed to detract from the power of what Max represented. One also needs to ask about the story, the unknown of what time or place we are following Max - would this have strengthened the story knowing what world we lived in? The understanding that this was a low-budget film was rooted in my mind, the techniques provided were impressive, but should that have been neglected for mediocre storytelling? Perhaps I misread this film, perhaps I missed the joy of why this is hailed as such a cult success.Another weakness against ""Mad Max"" has to be the relationship between his wife/girlfriend and child. Again, the lacking story helped confuse this viewer as to what dynamic they had, but when we have scenes in which the child is completely forgotten about - it just decimates the reasons behind Max's anger and utter breakdown. There were several scenes in which I yelled at the screen, ""What about the child"", then finally they would remember - he seemed to fade in and out of existence too often for one film. Then, when disaster strikes, we are forced to believe that suddenly Gibson would release his inner rage? It just didn't work. The same can be said for his wife/girlfriend. A stronger definition of character, and even more lines spoken would have helped me see the relationship. She seemed angry at first, the product of a failed marriage forced by this post-apocalyptic world to stay together, then we were introduced to love, then suddenly, she moved to idiocrity. Who would believe that running down a road, when there are open fields around, is the better option? It was these small inconsistencies that forced ""Mad Max"" from greatness to just another average action film. Two-plus hour sweeping epics aren't always needed, but stronger characters do help in creating the world that we, as viewers, are to inhabit for 90-ish minutes.""Mad Max"" is an important film, there is no question in my mind about that. The door that this film opened for future cinema in America couldn't have been done by a better group of filmmakers, but it isn't a promising classic. I could not watch this film again. The sequels I am ready for, but this ride is over - and the park is closing. I realize that I am in the minority, but ""Mad Max"" is a low-budget film that uses repetitive film-making as its staple - originality is present, but you must search to find it."
tt0079501,5.0,"This movie is primarily a classic, in my opinion, because it was the prequel which led to THE ROAD WARRIOR, which really is a classic.  MAD MAX was made on a low budget, yes, and some nice things were done with very little money. (Although choppy editing is inexcusable no matter how low the budget, and there's lots of nonsensical editing in this flick.) THe opening sequences of the film, in which the various police chase Nightrider, is fairly effective and sets one up for ever increasing excitement.  However, the movie heads pretty much downhill from there in terms of excitement.The events that make Max ""Mad"" happen so late in the film, and then his revenge is so abruptly carried out that it is about as anti-climactic as anything can be.  Toecutter, whom we've grown to despise, should face a clever, hard-fought death at the hands of Max, instead of the abrupt end that comes to him almost without Max's help.Mel Gibson is okay in the movie, but has little to do.  THe actor playing Goose is the most fun, certainly.  I only recommend the movie to those who feel they MUST have the backstory to The Road Warrior, but frankly, the future envisioned in MAD MAX is very different from the truly post-apocalyptic world of the ROAD WARRIOR."
tt0116629,6.0,"Giant, hostile, alien spaceships appear overnight to move on Earth's natural resources; humanity's last, desperate hope is a shaky plan involving a captured UFO from the 1950s and an old PowerBook laptop. Seems like this one was a guilty-pleasure classic from opening day. ID4 isn't well-written and constantly bathes itself in dense layers of cheese, but it tries hard, most the character arcs connect and the big special effects hold up quite well, despite their age.For a movie that's so thoroughly reliant on spectacle, that last point is pretty important. The power of watching the White House or Empire State Building burst into a billion bitty pieces is still there, irresistible, while the magnitude of the invading fleet remains immense, and I think both can be attributed to the production's choice to eschew then-new CG techniques in favor of a large, intricately detailed stable of miniatures. We get a few hiccups, like the obviously green-screened fighter jets or the absurd visual of a golden retriever leaping to slow-motion safety through a fiery inferno, but for the most part it all looks great and it's still easy to get sucked into the experience.Of course, the whole thing is over-acted to death. Roland Emmerich has never been one to bring out nuance from his cast, and this is an awfully shallow effort, even by his standards. Bill Pullman nails the big motivational speech, set to a telegraphed swell of patriotic symphony, but otherwise lacks conviction as a limp, reactive PotUS. Randy Quaid is a cheap xerox of every alien abduction stereotype to ever enter pop culture. Jeff Goldblum is naturally quirky enough to make his role worthwhile, but it takes every bit of his innate charismatic magnetism to overcome the dumb plot developments. Will Smith is the only unequivocal success, barking and fist-pumping his way to bonafide action hero status in a simple but essential role as a beefy marine / pure force of will.From a critical perspective, this is cinematic junk food. Big bangs and shiny lights to dazzle the box office crowd, with a few easy jokes to lighten the mood. But yet, there's something else to it, something essential and inexplicable. It's just raw, simple fun, I suppose, that makes no apologies for how it acts or what it aims to be. It won't make you think or weep, but you'll feel, and that's worth something."
tt0116629,6.0,"Independence Day doesn't stand up particularly well to a second viewing. It is basically a millenial version of The War of the Worlds with grand-scale effects and a cast which probably cost almost as much as the effects. Will Smith, Randy Quaid, Jeff Goldblum, Adam Baldwin and Judd Hirsch help pick up a surprisingly talented (but underexploited) cast and seem to have enjoyed their parts. Unfortunately, the mediocre script allowed few of the other actors to make their roles shine.The plot is so simple it's hard to imagine a 140+ minute film about it. The earth is under invasion from a highly advanced and merciless alien culture hell bent on intergalactic conquest. Our most powerful weapons can not pierce their shields and their weapons are capable of incinerating cities the size of Washington DC with one shot. After the first wave of attacks, all seems lost, and humans must find some way to fight back.Roland Emmerich's direction is good. There are few dull moments and very little in the way of uninteresting and pointless scenes. Unfortunately, the characters are generally two-dimensional - even Bill Pullman's brooding, depressed President of the United States comes across as an uncomplicated, uninspired and unemotional individual. Limited character development and an uncomplicated plot result in a one-shot movie.The best performances in Independence Day are the semi-comedic ones (note the actors mentioned above. This should tell you most of what you need to know about the film. Enjoy it by not taking it seriously, but spare yourself a second viewing unless intoxicated. And, oh yea, don't see it if you have a problem with American nationalism - the film is full of it."
tt0116629,5.0,"And I say that swimming in sarcasm, because if vaporizing the City is love, I'd cringe to know what hate would be like. With this inane, extremely dumbed-down action movie he begins a trilogy of films that aims its ugly, brainless head towards destroying New York City (and the rest of the United States with it) as aliens decide we really would not make very good hosts and take everything with them, enveloping them in turquoise light -- somehow this color is akin to everything horror: see THE RING for another reference -- which consumes all it touches in a ball of fire. All the clichés of action films are here and just shows how empty this movie is, with all its patriotism and heroism plastered on almost every frame. But... for every great director there must be one counterpart, and Emmerich is more than willing to fill those shoes. Awful. And that's being kind."
tt0215129,6.0,"I found this movie to be funny, when compared to Something About Mary and American Pie.  And since it is in that arena, it gets a good reputation (though doesn't live up to it's precedors).  I found the plot alone humorous- College guy (Breckin Meyer) from Ithica, who is dating a girl (Rachel Blanchard)in Austin since he was little, tapes a sex tape with another girl by accident and mails it to her, so he must retrieve it with his friends (Seann W. Scott, DJ Qualls and Paulo Costanzo). 
The Always hilarious (especially here) Tom Green brings us along in this story as he tells the story to a tour group and also includes himself as a experimentist and snake feeder with mice.  The wackiness and sickness in this film brings out the best and it is dead pan funny.  One of the best comedies of the year.  Look for cameos by Horatio Sanz, Andy Dick and Fred Ward.  A"

tt0215129,6.0,This is a regulation teen/college student flick that supplies enough laughs to be successful. Tom Green was however the star of the movie. His scenes would generate a smile from the audience in anticipation of what was about to happen.These American movies with lower budgets than most the Hollywood big budget trash seem to produce better results as well.
tt3569230,6.0,"Legend is a gripping movie, there's no doubt about it. Seeing Tom Hardy on screen, whether he's playing Reggie, Ronald, or both, is absolutely captivating. He owns the roles, and despite their identical looks you feel that they're completely different people because of how well Hardy portrays them. Reggie is sophisticated, methodical, affable; Ronnie is impulsive, unpredictable, paranoid. As a vehicle for Tom Hardy's acting chops, Legend is a home run. Unfortunately, that is where the positives of the movie end.The movie is tonally confused from scene to scene. It can be romantic one minute, ultra-violent the next, then reserved and introspective the minute after that. It's clunky writing; every time the movie begins to gain momentum it trips on itself one way or another. Also, you really don't care about any character other than the twins. I mean, thankfully they're in just about every scene, but they're always surrounded by faceless goons, or with a generic love interest, or no-name cops - not fully fleshed out characters. This is in no way a fault of the actors though. Christopher Eccleston is wasted yet again as a villain after Thor: The Dark World. Here he's in an antihero role as the cop assigned to the Kray's case, but his lines lack any form of personality. He does what he can but he really has nothing to work with. Chazz Palminteri makes an appearance for about 5 minutes total as his usual gangster self, but in the end you're left scratching your head. So many characters, so much potential, but the only thing holding the movie together is Tom Hardy.So as you can infer, Legend is worth a watch if you're a Tom Hardy fan. He's scarily good in these roles, and two Tom Hardys are better than one. For that reason alone I can't give this movie a lower score. However, if you're looking for substance in a gangster biopic, you'll have to look elsewhere."
tt3569230,5.0,"The only good thing about this very average film is Tom Hardy's acting. A lesser talented actor would have made it almost unwatchable. Short on facts, the writers here have just invented or borrowed bits to try and make the film sensational. It hasn't worked very well but at least shows the 'Krays' were a couple of psychopathic violent lunatics whose scrambled brains believed they were something special. Fact is, in this film, the one bit of fact we do know was said by Chas Palmintiri as Angelo Bruno the Philly mob boss, 'mobsters should keep a low profile'. Ironically poor old Angelo Bruno got whacked by Nicky Scarfo, a psychopath mafiosi who just like the 'Krays' loved being high profile and just like the Krays was sentenced to die in prison.The 'Krays' and most of the morons who worked for them were as thick as planks. They were also seriously dangerous psychopathic paranoid, disorganised nut cases who would use violence against anybody who got in the way. Although the story seems to have forgotten a lot of well recorded facts and many real people. Where was older brother Charlie Kray and other faces who stood trial with them. Why so many of the main 60s true characters strangely left out of the film. The so called shootout scene was way off the recorded known facts in the Kray's pub the 'Carpenters Arms' and the only gunfight was in Catford at 'Mr Smiths' drinking club in 1965 and neither of the Krays were there. In this film, the 'Blind Beggar' pub had mysteriously moved from it's prominent place on the busy east end Whitechapel Rd to what was some unknown dark cobbled back street which was obviously a film set. Frances Shea had left Reg Kray 8 months after the wedding in 1965, she left diaries clarifying he was fairly useless as a man. The Triumph Spitfire he buys her was a 1967 registered car some two years later. Far from being respected by their 'firm' they were often looked upon a a couple of morons. Albert Donahue's nicknames for the twins was 'Gert and Daisy'. The film could have told interesting story if it had been researched properly. The true story is far more interesting than this fiction. None of it is anywhere near the truth. This film takes some of it's stories from an old book written by a toff named John Pearson. The book was written forty plus years ago and I can imagine they must have had a great time filling Pearson full of tall stories. But this film surpasses the book in being so full of fiction it becomes a spot the next mistake game. I am glad to say that the film does not glorify the 'Krays', it shows them more as the pathetic, paranoid, violent, brainless sick morons they were. Very lucky to have gotten away with their crimes for so long. But the 50s and 60s were not long after the war and London and times were a whole lot different. If anyone out there aspires to admire these couple of lowlifes, they seriously need a reality check up.The Krays and the Richardson stories have been hijacked by so many 'silly b***icks' wannabe gangsters and money grabbing Kray wives it has become a monumental joke. Much of it fuelled by old showbiz people like Barbara Windsor for one who come up with' they were good boys who loved their old Mum'. Many of the most evil despots in history loved their Mothers. The 'Krays' were hated with a passion by many of the proper old faces around London. The Krays were disorganised and out of control. Only last week, Freddie Foreman, who is a wily old fox and was smart enough to shun the limelight when he was active said had the Krays not been arrested they were due to be 'ironed out'. Freddie Foreman would know more about the Krays, the Richardsons and London's underworld than is contained the many books about the 'Krays'. There are many who were there who believe that it would have been better for all of us if they had been ironed out and disappeared off of the face of the earth in 1967. The 'Krays' do not deserve being called a legend. The bull***t has created an industry out there for second rate books, films and documentaries that will invent anything to get your money. This is just another one. As a gangster movie, it isn't in the same league as American films 'Godfather' 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino' from a Brit angle it doesn't come close to 'The long Good Friday' or 'Sexy Beast'. 'Legend' is just another ordinary film made watchable by Tom Hardy's performance.Before you see this movie, watch Monty Python's 'Pirhana Bros' sketch and take on the Krays, apart from being hilarious, the Pythons got it far more right than the writers of 'Legend'."
tt3569230,6.0,"The second of the big screen retellings of the Kray storyline, following on from 1990's THE KRAYS which starred real-life brothers Martin and Gary Kemp as the terrible twosome. While I enjoyed LEGEND on a superficial level, I found it an oddly hollow viewing experience and not as good as the previous version. The problem lies with the direction, which is oddly inexperienced for a long-time director like Brian Helgeland.The issues with LEGEND are entirely down to tone, and the tone just isn't right. The setting-up scenes are fine, the transition scenes are fine, and the film is well-shot throughout with an excellent eye for realism and a decent budget. What a shame, then, that all of the pivotal scenes are so oddly staged in a semi-humorous tone. It feels like Helgeland wanted to make the story a comedy, which is the last thing it could be.This jokey approach to the material manifests itself in the violent moments, which are rather incredibly played for laughs whereas really the raw power of the incidents should have come out. It's present in Tom Hardy's dual role; the special effects are excellent (and have come a long way since Van Damme played twins in DOUBLE IMPACT) but Ronnie Kray is nothing more than a caricature here, a weirdo played for maximum relish by the off-beat actor.LEGEND also messes up some of the source material, which is a little odd. I've read Reggie's autobiography so have some experience with the facts. For some reason this film plays down the pivotal relationship between the Krays and their mother; the latter only appears in a couple of scenes. In contrast, it bigs up the role Frances Shea played in the story, giving her way too much screen time at the expense of others. Thus at times LEGEND feels like a romance rather than the gangster epic it should be. It's certainly not a bad film, but is it something I'd watch again? Not really - I'd prefer going back to THE KRAYS."
tt3569230,6.0,"Tom Hardy is Brilliant in this and after a while you forget that he is acting both roles as Reggie and Ronnie. Nothing much new in this apart from the tragedy of Reggie's wife Frances and that is the slant that they put on this otherwise well known story, but it is in fact Hardy's portrayal of Ronnie that is most outstanding. he captures the true madness of the man without becoming a caricature.His portrayal of Reggie was also pretty much spot on and showed how he struggled with wanting to be a successful businessman but unable to escape his violent side.Without Tom Hardy's exceptional acting though the movie would have been pretty dull."
tt3569230,6.0,"In the shadows of Johnny Depp's ""Black Mass"", there is another crime thriller based on real characters and events from 2015: This is ""Legend"". It was written and directed by Academy Award winner Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential"") and runs for an impressive 132 minutes. Actor Tom Hardy plays twin brothers Ronald and Reggie Kray, who are very different in terms of character for the most part of the film, but actually really similar in terms of certain crucial situations. Hardy definitely did a fine job with this double role he has here and his acting, together with the film's script, result in a couple pretty great moments. This fraternal relationship is one of the core elements of the film. Others include one character's relationship with Emily Browning's character. She played her character well too and was a very positive surprise. I must say I have never been a big Tom Hardy fan, but with performances like these, he certainly elevates my interest in him. Finally, there are of course many crime-related (sometimes also police-related) developments happening in here, also interesting to watch for the most part.I liked the watch. I believe this film could have been kept down at 110 minutes maybe with cutting out the occasional moment that drags, but it's still never really bad in terms of getting bored because it is a very long film. The main characters are all fun and exciting to watch and will maybe even have your eyes glued to the screen on some occasions. The supporting actors are not all that tremendously exciting to watch, but most of them are fine too. And of course, there is still the crucial factor that this is based on real people. Ronnie's homosexuality and the way he actually dealt with it publicly in a very progressive manner resulted in the occasionally awkward laugh here, together with Hardy's excellent delivery. I am not sure if this film has a performance as good as Edgerton in ""Black Mass"", but it's good acting all around in here and if you have seen and enjoyed that one, it's very likely that you will enjoy this film here too. 2015 is certainly a good year for films based on real life gangsters. I recommend ""Legend"". Nowhere near the level where I would consider this one of the year's finest achievements, but delightful to watch. Thumbs up. Also for the inclusion of ""Going to the Chapel"" and ""Something Stupid"". Some great music in here."
tt3569230,5.0,"If asked what this film is ""about"", you can respond that it's about the Krays - and you can't be much more specific than that.The possibilities were immense - it could have been about the politics of the Kray empire, or a character study into what made the Krays tick, or (probably what the film should have gone for) a focused story of the Krays' downfall. Instead, the film lacks any real coherence or a strong narrative arc; it essentially consists of a series of scenes which could have been played in almost any order.Now, a film which deals with real events always has to strike a balance between authenticity and arranging events into a satisfyingly cohesive narrative. This can be a problem for films striving for strict accuracy, but Legend's larger-than-life, often tongue-in-cheek approach left plenty of room for fashioning a narrative. Yet the closest Legend comes to telling a story concerns the relationship between Reggie and his wife Frances. This was an odd choice of perspective (Frances functions as the movie's narrator), not least because the film doesn't really explore the relationship in any real depth - for instance, five minutes into their first date, Reggie and Frances kiss and that's all that's done to establish that they're ""in love"". Although Emily Browning performed well enough as Frances, the writing for her character was so bad it was jarring - she speaks in horrible movie clichés, in a way that no-one ever speaks in real life.The writing is otherwise excellent, and brought to life by fantastic performances from the whole cast - but especially, of course, Tom Hardy. His portrait of Ronnie, though it constantly borders on being absolutely preposterous, is impossible to tear your eyes away from. In every scene, I was waiting for the camera to cut back to Ronnie so I could savour the performance.Does Hardy's double-performance redeem the film's shortcomings? Well, yes - enough for me to say that this film is worth a watch. You will be entertained, even if the film drags towards the end.But ultimately, Hardy's incredible performance is wasted on a film which failed to tell a story. Legend provides no sort of insight into Reggie and Frances' relationship, or the downfall of the Krays, or the workings of their empire, or, most crucially of all, into the motivations and characters of the Krays."
tt12263384,6.0,"The first 45 minutes are spectacular. I was having constant goosebumps for 20 minutes straight. I was in total awe; I couldn't avoid smiling. You will not witness much better stunts and choreography (it is arguably better than that of the John Wick trilogy).What's most impressive is the camerawork. There is a 20-minute sequence without any visible cuts that is so immersive. You will be blown away by the impressive technological achievement this crew has achieved. I could hardly believe what I was watching; helicopters landing on moving trains and cameras going in and out of windows have never been easier to follow. This is not a gimmick; it's a highly efficient tool used to make the movie highly intriguing.The rest of the movie does sadly not live up to what the first act had to offer. It goes from an action masterpiece to another generic action-thriller by Netflix. It should honestly have ended after 50 minutes. There is no way you could top what we've just seen. The story doesn't justify the action. They are fighting -- but why? They go back and forth between each other, and at one point it gets tiresome. Just finish it up already.Overall, a movie worth your time with some spectacular action. Don't go into this expecting a movie with substance, but rather an entertaining movie. Can't a movie be nothing more than entertaining at times? Sometimes that's enough. Good writing is however important to make the breathtaking action mean something."
tt12263384,5.0,"One of the bigger Netflix original hits over the previous few years, 2020's Extraction provided the streaming bigwig with a new franchise starter in the form of Chris Hemsworth's rough as guts Aussie black market mercenary for hire Tyler Rake and without attempting to reinvent the wheel in any way, shape or form 3 years on, we now have Extraction 2.The type of safe sequel that is going to ensure anyone that had a great time with Tyler first time around running and gunning through Bangladesh is going to have a repeat experience this go around, while anyone that found the Hemsworth lead action thriller nothing more than mindlessly acceptable are highly unlikely to be converted by this experience, Extraction 2 dishes up the same high body count thrill ride meal this go around in what amounts to another film with some seriously impressive action beats but a an equally undercooked and raw set of characters/story arcs.Highlighted by what is likely to remain one of if not the best 2023 action sequences that sees Rake take part in an extensive one take sequence that features prison riots, helicopter chases and more hand to hand combat than a Raid double bill, when Extraction 2's significantly impressive action set-ups are underway it's operating at an elite level but despite all the wizardry in this department that director Sam Hargrave and his team conjure up, there's a lot of lameness present in Extraction 2 elsewhere that anchors it down in a big way.Wasting precious little time on getting over the fact Rake was last seen knocking on deaths door in the first outing, Hargrave and his leading man get Rake and his crack team that includes Golshifteh Farahani's and Adam Bessa's Nik and Yaz Khan moving at a rapid pace to transport us to the country of Georgia, where Rake's next extraction mission is located and where we meet our collection of cookie cutter side characters that includes your new candidate for most annoying movie person of the year, Andro Japaridze's Sandro Radiani.Seemingly developed for no other reason than to progress the films plot beyond that of its core extraction sequence that will get tongues wagging and audiences talking in that buzzy way needed for direct to streaming films to stand out from the crowd, Sandro is a bastion as to why Extraction 2 can never break free and become the new age action classic it potentially might have been with questionable scripting, characters and narrative decisions all working against a film that puts all of its best eggs in one early basket and never really gets close to delivering to the same level the next hour or so following.With a third Extraction already proudly announced by Netflix and the creative team behind the Rake feature film universe, this Chris Hemsworth and Russ Brothers backed property still has a chance to prove its worthy of being considered alongside the greats of the action thriller genre but at this stage its still nothing more than an impressively staged experience with little too no heart and soul.Final Say -We may get to know a little more about Tyler Rake this time around but despite a noteworthy extended action sequence, Extraction 2 is another cold movie going experience that feels like a little brother to the kings of the genre it wants to conquer.2 1/2 AFL broadcasts out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
tt12263384,5.0,"This is partly the sort of popcorn action movie which was defining of the 1980s, and as such this is pretty good or at least watchable. But partly this feels like watching a shot-them-up game with the same mindless go from point A to point B, do the thing, kill everyone, then go from B to C, do the thing, kill everyone. Repeat. With the sudden but inevitable betrayal. And if you look at this movie from that perspective it is meh at best, a really dumb B-movie at worst.The acting is solid, albeit nothing special. The effects are okay for the budget, and the action is more than passable. Sound design, sets and the rest are as good as one can expect from a Netflix movie. Directing is pretty good, probably what mainly save this, together with solid acting, from being too trashy.The story is very simplistic though, and the characters are pretty basic people. No real development either, this is really just a gameplay Netflix action movie. Don't expect anything, shut down your brain, and have some beers and you might enjoy this. But if you have any expectations and think about what is going on in a sober way, then this is pretty bad.I kinda like this though. Mainly because it this is better than most similar movies of today. Which says a lot more about the ""competition"" than this movie. I give it a 5/10. I think this is watchable, but not much more."
tt12263384,5.0,"Only recommended to those who just wanna watch a fierce, full on action movie, with fight after fight.Starter tip: skip the first 20 minutes of talking, action starts from 20 minutes onward.The good: the only redeeming feature of this movie is the (often, not always) terrific action photography. There are a few (about 3) long action sequences that could come straight out of a Mission Impossible movie. The same wow factor. Really impressive. There are lots of over the top special effects stunts that are out of whack. Nice!Too bad though that they didnt restrain themselves from using too much CGI, it would have even further enhanced some of these terrific action scenes. Mind you there is a lot (A LOT) of ""filler"" action as well, with shootouts that are NOT impressive in any way. Bummer.The bad: when there is no action though, this movie really fails. Big time. I mean, the characters are cardboard. The dialogues are cringeworthy. The whole story about Chris Hemsworth saving a mother and her 2 children is terrible, up to a level that I simply had to skip these ridiculous talking scenes, that only held up the action.Definitely not great as a whole, but worth one watch for (some of) the action spectacle scenes."
tt12263384,5.0,"Extraction II offers nothing new to the action movie genre. In the first couple of minutes you can have the entire story figured out.The one cliche that annoys me is that the baddie always cries and carries on about one of their loved ones dying - yet they kill hundreds of other people's loved ones and are the one responsible for their loved one dying by being evil. It is time to take this old, worn out cliche out of movies.The other action movie cliche that has been so overplayed is where the hero is so injured and damaged, but remarkably regains his battle prowess and martial arts techniques overnight. It is so ridiculous to see anyone who needs months, or years, of rehab become super in days."

...because I remember the first movie seeking more realistic. Or at least as far as Hollywood goes.The intro is slow, but once he takes a month of rehab to fully cure from a destroyed body and clinically dying...he is back in mission.And then it's an action scene that really feels like it's never going to end. And I kind of wished it to stop. It was like the john wick 4 stair scene...but lasted 30 min straight. The only thing I could think is, if these forces could rally a literal army in seconds to this extraction...where they heck were they all seconds prior to prevent it.I'm 46 min in and literally nothing if substance has occurred yet. If it wasn't for Chris hemsworth being in it, I would have turned it off 25 min ago. I disappointed because the last one was so good. There was a more soy craft to it.

One day, Alcott (Idris Elba) shows up with a new mission. This time, it's personal.This is perfectly fine as Chris Hemsworth tries to build a new B-action franchise over on Netflix. The Russo brothers have given Sam Hargrave an opportunity to direct. Sam is a stunt guy and this is most notable for its long action stunt sequences. I would prefer that he leaves the CGI out of his work as much as possible. The prison break section worn me out as the CGI action gets really unreal. It felt fake and I stopped caring. The tower apartment is another story. Sure, there is also CGI and outrageous action, but the apartment tower grounds the action. It felt much more real and therefore much more compelling. This franchise needs to figure out what makes it special. The long action sequences should be that specialty as long as they ground it with real action."

tt0343737,6.0,"Speaking as a viewer who had been eagerly anticipating the release of this movie since way back in the days when Leonardo DiCaprio was attached to star, I can honestly say I was very disappointed in the final outcome. Perhaps the film had simply become too hyped, with everyone proudly boasting it as ""De Niro's comeback"", but... suffice to say, no matter how hard I tried to enjoy this movie, it completely failed to entice me in any way, shape or form. Director Robert De Niro tries a bold new touch by attempting a ""CIA feel"" for the film, in the sense that an element of mystery is present throughout the entire plot, attempting to better immerse us in the world of lies, deception and uncertainty that was the early CIA. Unfortunately, this method backfires very noticeably, as the plot seems to weave all over the place and we are presented with flat, uninteresting characters who are denied the further development or screen time which might actually have made them appealing. We are simply presented with a slew of famous faces in tiny roles, appearing and disappearing so quickly we barely have the chance to register their presence, but there is no connection with the characters, nor the long, overly confusing convoluted plot they play a part in. But the film's real weakness is the apathy factor. In a recent interview, De Niro acknowledged his intent that the plot should be more elusive and less obvious, to make the viewer work harder and appreciate the film further. He then proceeded to mention how viewers should be emotionally affected and connect with the characters, even if the plot may not always be clear, and we may not always what's going on, or who's killing who, or why. This is where De Niro's film really loses its viewers; the fact that not only is there not enough emotional connection to coast by, ignoring a lack of plot continuity, but the fact that there is no emotional connection whatsoever. Not only do we not know what is going on, nor are able to keep up fast enough to catch onto what few plot clues we may, but we can't invest enough interest into the film to do so. After a few scenes of brief, murky, unexplained and unrelated plot excerpts and confusing flashbacks from present to past times (made more difficult by the fact that James Wilson, Matt Damon's character never seems to age, and appears the same even 20 years later) we lose interest entirely, and find ourselves unable to care for the characters, nor care what is happening. We are kept at such a distance, both through an intentionally unclear plot and by uninteresting flat archetypes of characters that any interest we might originally have retained in the film quickly evaporates. It's a shame that the film is so emotionally distancing though, as on the exterior it does appear to be a very stylish and classy piece of work. The cinematography is superb, capturing many unique, innovative shots and scenes, and the costume and set design are simply sumptuous, perfectly capturing the feel of the time period in a glossy, picturesque fashion. It is a shame how fully the apathy factor permeates the film though, because Eric Roth's script seems to be terse, tight, and engaging, but many lines are inaudible through muttering or fast speaking characters, and we are simply kept at such an emotional distance it is beyond us to make an effort to follow the rapid fire, confusing exchanges. We want to like the script, but it is so twisty and clouded with uncertainty, much like a CIA document itself, that we find ourselves also left in the dark. De Niro has assembled a stellar cast here, but he seems content to reduce most of them to very un-flashy cameos, giving us little chance to connect with any of the characters. Matt Damon is an effective figure as the film's star, James Wilson, remaining admirably cold, detached and stoic throughout the film, but the plot backfires once again - a lead character who is meant to be, all pretenses aside, boring, still comes across as boring, no matter how strongly they are played. Angelina Jolie seems a bit out of place as Wilson's spunky yet abandoned wife; she plays the part well enough, but fails to submerge her star power and charisma in a role where a much less noticeable and subdued female lead would've been far more effective. John Turturro stands out as a vicious CIA interrogator, one of the few flashes of emotion or engaging character action in the entire film, and Joe Pesci makes good use of his far too brief cameo as a mob boss. There are also noteworthy appearances by Michael Gambon, Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt, Tammy Blanchard and Timothy Hutton, but their parts are reduced to far too brief and uninteresting segments for us to really connect with or care about their characters. De Niro himself almost steals the show with a tiny role as a military general who constantly complains about his feet. All in all, the Good Shepherd comes across as a tremendous disappointment, considering the incredibly successful film it was poised to be. Maybe I had too many expectations, having looked forward to the movie for so long, or maybe the film was overly hyped, but either way, the film falls flat as far too long, self indulgent, emotionally distancing and just plain uninteresting, wrapped together in a bundle of self-imposed apathy. All except for fans of Robert De Niro or the rest of the cast willing to sit through an extremely long and un-engaging movie should give this one a pass, lest De Niro's self confidence be flattened forever. -6/10"
tt0343737,5.0,"This a very long movie. It's a bit confusing unless you intend to rewatch the beginning after watching the end. Then ... you can understand the beginning better. Sound confusing? It shouldn't be this hard to watch a movie. Plus, the first 2 1/4 hours of this nearly 3 hour movie is kind of boring.The movie is basically about the life of a man during the start of the CIA. We follow him from his induction into an elite fraternity (or order) into his career with the formation of the CIA.If it doesn't sound interesting, that's because that's all there really is. Unless you're a CIA history buff and are interested in this stuff, it's a bit boring for the average viewer. There is only one place where there is a real plot - and that's right at the end for about 15 minutes.Furthermore, the way the movie is chopped up and given how long it is, it's likely you'll forget the what happened at the beginning by the time you get to the end.For the average viewer, this movie isn't really worth the time. For the CIA history aficionado - knock yourself out."
tt0343737,6.0,"""The Good Shepherd"" is my second best film of 2006. A lot of people who have seen it will think differently and I can understand that. This film is not for everyone, but the viewers who have a love for US History, The Cold War, CIA, Espionage, or Spy films should be pleased with ""The Good Shepherd."" It is very subtle, but extremely effective. ""The Good Shepherd"" is told from a series of flashbacks during a two week mission to find the significance of a document that was sent to the house of Edward Wilson by an anonymous person(s). We see the rise of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) from his ranks as a Skull and Bones member to the head of the Counter Intelligence section of CIA.Robert De Niro directs this epic, near-masterpiece, of the creation of CIA through one mans eyes, Edward Wilson. Matt Damon gives a great performance and one of his best along with ""The Departed"" and ""Good Will Hunting."" Damon plays Edward Wilson who starts off as a Yale graduate and Skull and Bones member. He is recruited by an FBI Agent (Alec Baldwin) to spy on his poetry professor Dr. Fredrick's (Michael Gambon), who is believed to have set up a Nazi organization and is enlisting students and faculty members. Edward agrees to spy on his professor after some talking into and gets the names of the people Dr. Fredrick's has enlisted, which leads to his firing on the basis of his political beliefs.On Deer Island (Skull and Bones retreat) he meets Margaret ""Clover"" Russell (Angelina Jolie) who seeks out Edward immediately and finds something about him quite intriguing. Matt Damon plays ""the man made out of stone"" giving little to no emotional reaction to anything and just about everything. Edward Wilson is a man of few words, but he chooses wisely what few words he speaks.Edward Wilson falls in love with Laura, played wonderfully by Tammy Blanchard- a deaf women- but their relationship comes to an abrupt end as Edward finds that Margaret has become pregnant with his child and Edward is to do what is expected of him. This means he will have to leave Laura and marry Clover. A week after their marriage Edward has to go overseas during WWII, mostly working out of Germany, but is sent to London and joins the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), by General Bill Sullivan (Robert De Niro).After the war Germany is crumbling and Edward Wilson is climbing the ranks garnering more and more trust. The Soviets are now looking to acquire as many scientists as possible. In Berlin, Edward Wilson meets his adversary, codename ""Ulysses,"" and the back and forth battle between Wilson (His codename is ""Mother"") and Ulysses is something to really behold and some of the best scenes in the film take part during their back and forth battle of disinformation and counter intelligence and deception and infiltration of spies sent into one another's operations and then each adversary takes out these spies, then sends the ""message"" that these spies were found and disposed of. Was that confusing? Neither seems to gain much of any ground on each other until the end of the film where Ulysses sends a spy into Wilson's Agency and get's valuable information from someone very close to Edward Wilson. This information ruins the ""Bay of Pigs"" invasion which turns out to be a costly loss and damaging defeat. Wilson has to make a tough decision between his family and his country.Edward Wilson was a man of selflessness who put his entire life into his country and did what he could do with his son. He makes sacrifices for his country and for his son. He sacrifices his time and relationship with his family for his country. He sacrifices his true love with Laura and marries Margaret for his son. If you were going to sum up Edward Wilson it probably would be best to use the term ""selfless."" Everything he does is for his country and the future of it. We never see him do much of anything for his own personal joy. This kind of behavior leads to a marriage that crumbles and falls apart. He plays the protector and is forced to do things such as have people killed and interrogated for the greater good. All over an idea- Communism. I loved it. It may take a few viewings to fully understand the complexities of this film, but it is well worth it and an intense film with some great action and conversation throughout the film. 9.7/10"
tt1361336,6.0,"From what I've seen, the production team really stayed as closely as possible to the quick-witted humor that made ""Tom & Jerry"" the cat and mouse duo many came to know dating back to the 1940s and 50s. To have their tomfoolery (eh?) now be used in the modern times in a live-action setting? Well, it seems to be a step up from its fully animated 1992 predecessor, which had them speaking and singing.Here in 2021, keeping them mute is better off as they don't need words when all their actions always spoke volumes. The throwbacks to their past cartoon shorts was a great tribute. It also fills me with glee Warner Bros. used some archival recordings of William Hanna and Mel Blanc to give off the screaming and yelling sounds Tom makes when in pain or in fear. What a way to honor these men who gave Tom a voice.As for the plot? There's not much there when you place familiar faces like Chloe Grace Moretz, Colin Jost, Michael Peña, and Ken Jeong getting caught in the crossfire of the duo's antics in a lavish hotel setting in New York City. Chloe's character Kayla does her best at her new job, but proves difficult with the chaos that ensues. It's just okay. I can understand from Chloe that she cited Bob Hoskins as her inspiration to interact with animated characters, much like what he did as Detective Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (a classic).Cartoon animals sharing the screen with live-action characters has been done countless times in the past, so overall, this live-action/animated film does give off an old-school charm of classic cartoon violence and slapstick humor, but it just falls short on expectations. My one nitpick is relying too much on today's trends and lifestyles. They don't need them to be funny. It's no Roger Rabbit, but definitely fun for kids. For adults who grew up watching the original cartoon shorts? You can sit this one out and stick with the originals for a good laugh."

tt1361336,6.0,"""Alright this movie is not really bad but not really good, first i like the animation, the story is pretty interesting, i like the music, now the perfomance let's begin with Michael Pena i think he is very entertaining and that doesn't mean it's good but it's entertaining, Ken Joeng is funny i like it, now the big problem is Chloe Grace Moretz perfomance, i think she is really bad in here, i just don't like it, it just not right to her playing this, when i see in the trailer i think she is the perfect cast but unfortunately it's not, there's a couple of cool scene with the cinematography and stuff, i love the fight scene it's very Tom & Jerry, and this maybe a little bit spoiler but watching Tom singing with a freakin autotune is just the worse thing in here, and it's actually kinda hard to give this movie a score, i really want to give this movie 7 but always after i think 'ok i wanna give this movie 7' then bad things happened most of it because of the perfomance, then i downing the score again then good things happen, it's really really up and down so the fair things i can do is in the middle, but to be honest again i really really more enjoy seeing Tom & Jerry rather than seeing a real life person doing conversation or whatever they do plus Chloe Grace Moretz bad perfomance, overall Tom & Jerry it's still entertaining but they have some serious problem which is the lead female actrees perfomance in here"""

Well explained. Story was so clear, its amazing how they show us superman's perspective, batman's perspective and society's perspective on each other in a one movie. I really love this movie. BvS UE is one of thw best cbm to me."
tt10151854,5.0,"Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline picks up where we left off from the first film with Billy and his orphaned friends being super heroes and secretly, regularly saving people from unfortunate events. When three sisters retrieve the broken staff from the first film and look to open a portal from Olympus to Earth to take over civilization, Billy and friends are the only ones that can stop them.This movie is directed by David F. Sandberg (Lights Out) and stars Zachary Levi (The Mauritanian), Grace Caroline Currey (Fall), Helen Mirren (The Queen), Lucy Liu (Kill Bill), Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond) and Meagan Good (Think Like A Man).This movie kicks up the action scenes and special effects but the storyline lacks the heart and charm of the first film. I did love the incorporation of the mythological creatures, especially the villain's creatures and the unicorns. I will say the dragon was uneven with some sequences that were awesome and some that were too much. Once again Djimon Hounsou was excellent as the wizard and Liu and Mirren were great villains. The comedy was hit or miss with some good laughs here and there and some cheese also. Meagan Good looked amazing as always and I loved the cameo at the end. The ending credits sequence wasn't good.Overall, this is an average addition to the super hero genre that's worth seeing once. I would score this a 5/10."
tt10151854,6.0,"The sequel takes us through the Philadelphia fiasco, where Billy and fellow foster kids are enjoying their superhero days in their annoying childish manner. Enters the three daughters of Atlas who wants to take back their powers stolen from them and wreck havoc in the human realm. It is upto the Philly fiasco to be the Champions to beat the goddesses and save the realm.What works is the humor despite the teens being annoying enough. Billy still is going through the impostor syndrome, trying to figure out where ye fits in. The action set pieces are elaborate and are entertaining for most parts of it. The screenplay checks off all the stuff a comic book sequel needs and the dull moments are lesser than anticipated.What doesn't work are the weak villains. Though Lucy Liu makes the best of what she can with her riding the dragon in the third act, the trio however come out as bland. I mean they are goddesses who get overwhelmed by a group of kids. Add to this, Zachary Levi as Shazam / Billy is less fun and more desperately trying to be funny. His character didn't fully work for me.Overall, the film knows it's limitations and plays along."
tt10151854,6.0,"Gonna be honest this was never a movie I was really hyped for, just like the first one and the final result it's kinda the same. It's an ""okay"" B grade movie. No disrespect, there must be movies like this too.The story it's pretty basic and if you watch the trailers you can pick up the pieces quite fast.Nothing really special, nothing intriguing, it is more predictable actually. The kids are now grown up and I wanted to see more of their chemistry, but instead we got more action, which is not bad on paper, but in reality it's kinda blunt and forgettable for the whole movie.Talking about forgettable things...the villains fit pretty well in this category. I mean Helen Mirren is outstanding actress, but it's ""just another villain"" scenario.The effects at some times look underwhelming...actually the trailers hinted at that.If you liked the first movie, I guess you gonna like this one too. I don't have many problems with it, it was just boring in my eyes. The humor is okay for younger audience, but there are some good jokes for more matured audience too.Overall it's ""okay"", but it's not gonna be one of the more rewatchable movies in the DC catalog...I guess."
tt10151854,6.0,"This film does not do any one thing great, but it was still a pretty decent watch. The plot is average-nothing we have not seen on the big screen before. Our villains have no development; their motivations are sound, but there is nothing further that develops them into something greater.This movie starts off incredibly strong, with a fantastic first act that had me laughing hysterically. The comedy hits more often than not, which was a surprise for me. There is a bridge rescue scene that is electric. The combination of ""I Need a Hero"" mixed with all of the heroes showcasing their abilities was amazing. I think superhero films have dropped the ball by not showing heroes rescuing everyday people. The stakes have gotten so high outside of the everyday troubles that this art is lost. I really enjoyed that aspect of the film, but unfortunately, after the first act, this story becomes inflated to a point where it is indistinguishable from many other superhero blockbusters.The final act is overly long and bloated with a plethora of CGI monsters for our heroes to defeat. I think the CGI actually looked pretty good, but it just was not an engaging conclusion for me. The stakes were high, but not built up properly for me to be genuinely interested. The action is pretty decent, but I couldn't care less. The finale did have emotional beats in terms of the family connection, which worked surprisingly well. That is when this franchise works best. When the focus is on family and not on god's attempts to destroy Earth,The performances overall were pretty good. Zachary Levi is fantastic as Shazam; he has mastered the art of playing a child in a man's body. Jack Dylan Grazer is hilarious; his comedic timing is brilliant. Grace Caroline Currey is a queen. Rachel Zegler is a standout, and her chemistry with Grazer is top notch. The rest of the Shazamly do a great job as well. I think Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu are fine as antagonists but were wasted with a lack of screen time and development.Overall, this might not be good, but it is entertaining. That is a lot more than can be said for some of the recently released superhero films (Black Adam and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania).Score: 65%
Verdict: Decent."
tt10151854,5.0,"Shazam! Fury of the Gods is a painful example of all the problems in current filmmaking in a single movie. I felt overall less intelligent for having seen it.I love movies. Up until recently, a month didn't go by without me going to the movies at least 3 or 4 times. I'll watch anything and enjoy myself, feeling refreshed and at peace when I leave the theater. Then came the dark times.There are so many problems with the Shazam! Fury of the Gods, I don't know where to start. So, I'll start with the writing. It's bad. The most glaring and annoying creative debacle is the writer's inability to write teenagers. The main character is minutes away from turning 18 and acts and speaks like an 8 year old. And, not just an 8 year old but an 8 year old from the 1950's, think Dennis the Menace for those of you old enough to remember the tv show. Both as themselves and their superhero alter egos, every time these actors open their mouths idiocy of the highest caliber spills forth! I was truly embarrassed for the actors and constantly annoyed by the dialogue.The plot was hugely contrived. Events transpired not as a part of the natural ebb and flow of a story but because they needed to happen for the film makers. Sometimes, this even broke rules the filmmakers created themselves.The actors had nothing to work with and sunk to the challenge. I like the cast, I think Helen Mirren is a treasure and Zachary Levi is awesome but... wow. The best performances came from side characters, the actors playing the foster parents. The rest of the cast had me wishing everyone else would loose and the movie would just end. The wisdom of Solomon was smart enough to skip this movie.I don't know what part of this broken carnival ride to lay at the director's feet, unless disjointed and nonsensical were his goal. I felt less intelligent for having seen Shazam! Fury of the Audience.All the bad movies these days are lowering my movie bar. So, I'd give up this movie a 4.5/10. A lot of people worked hard to make Shazam! Fury of the Gods. It's a shame all there hard work resulted in this puddle of melted ice cream. I want my money back."
tt10151854,6.0,"The original Shazam! Was a surprise hit as it took many audiences and critics alike. Following four years later, there definitely didn't seem to be that much anticipation regarding this sequel. It sort of went under the radar which resulted in a box office flop.However even with the flaws of this film, the visuals and characters bring enough energy where it is still an entertaining watch. The mystical aspect with the monsters creatures and dragons weren't bad. Although Lucy Liu and Helen Miren we're both entirely miscast.It's clear the the writers wanted to appeal more to a family audience with more silly juvenile humor, where which a majority of it didn't work.One thing which was highly irritating and over the top is the overall acting by Zachary Levi. Him as Shazam is portraying a 17 year old (they mention he's turning 18 in some months) yet he's acting like a 10 year old child. Why exactly were the portrayals by the child Shazam (Billy) and adult Shazam different? The other adult superheroes were portraying their characters accurately.Also very nice brief Wonder Woman cameo. This was a clear trade for another sequel yet we doubt that happening anymore.Overall this sequel isn't as good as the original but it's still solid enough. Better than Black Adam and better than these low reviews are claiming it as such."
tt10151854,6.0,"Shazam: Fury of The Gods is the second installment in the Shazam! Series. I watched the first one and I thought this was a great movie. Then come the second one and yes, it was also good, but not great. There are many positive and negative sides of this movie that I'm going to tell you about now. The positive sides were the visual effects. I think the effects were great made in this movie, especially in the battle sequences and the magic scenes. The costumes were great too, to the superheroes. I liked the Sisters of Atlas, but compared to other DC villains like Joker or The Riddler, I do not think there are so rememberable as them. The bad sides were first of all, it was too long. I know this is a superhero movie and it is supposed to be long, but for the story I think this movie could be 15 minutes shorter. The script were pretty weak, too. The humor was still good, but sometimes the dialogues were pretty stupid and unnecessary, I think. The second thing that was bad was that they didn't show the children's life as good as in the first movie. In this movie, they show more the superhero perspective, not so much from the children's, what I think was kind of bad. When I think more and more about it, I think that it is not the best DC movie that I have watched, but I think this is a great movie to go and watch with your friends if you have time. DC is not so impressive this days with making new movies. The Batman from 2022 was good and I have heard rumors about a new movie called Blue Beetle. I hope it will be a good comeback."
tt3794354,6.0,I think they did a good job with this. The design of Sonic so so much better than the one featured in the trailer. It baffles me how they thought the original design was ok. It looked like a child's drawing of something they had seen in a nightmare.The relationship between Sonic and James Marsden is super cute too and you'd do become invested in it.It is very much a kids movie but it's nice for older people to see as it's filled with nostalgia from the Sonic games. There are plenty of little Easter eggs that people who have played the game will notice.This movie is also really charming. It has lines that are funny too.So I would watch it especially if you have any interest in Sonic I don't think you will be disappointed or frustrated at what they have done with the property.
tt3794354,5.0,"Watching this movie is like having an amazing time on a rollercoaster but after it's done you have a big headache or you need to barff. Like you had fun, it was awesome while it lasted but when it's finished it's like really? I admit I liked this movie, but as much as I liked it there's a lot I didn't like. I liked the pace, the chemistry between sonic and the side character, I liked how they handled the story. The jokes can be funny sometimes, other times they don't land and just seem very corny. I thought Jim Carrey as robotnic was ok just felt they should have actually casted someone that looks like him. Sonic comes off as a creep, spying on people, Hidding from them for like YEARS. And for some reason, when he ACTUALLY needs to hide, he doesn't, for a guy with super speed he also can't dodge a tranquilizer bullet? I mean the entire movie shows him dodging missiles and bar fights, but he can't dodge a tranquilizer bullet? A lot of the logic just doesn't add up. I admit theres a lot I like about this movie but there's a lot I don't."
tt3794354,6.0,"The movie is fun. It has some fun jokes. Robotnik is a really fun character with witty, fun dialogue. The movie understands what it is, and doesn't try to be something it is not, which is good. It doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some problems in the logic, as there is never a sense of real urgency in Sonic as he travels by car to San Francisco (even when he can clearly run properly again). Tom being all over the news never has a real impact in the plot.
The conflict in the movie is actually there and keeps it interesting. Sonic is very charming and fun to watch. Overall, the movie is enjoyable and good.Oh, and Tails cameo was so great. Made me super excited."
tt3794354,5.0,"Let me sum it up in one line - Sonic The Hedgehog is Paramount Pictures' attempt to Americanize the iconic character of Sonic with moderately appealing results. For a video game flick, it's not all that bad. While it definitely doesn't offer an intriguing premise, it doesn't overstay its welcome either. At a crisp run-time of 95 minutes, it's a decent (but unmemorable) watch.The attempt to turn Sonic into a bucket-list ticking American didn't completely win me over. My biggest problem with the movie, however, is that it lacks logic even by Sonic-verse standards. Sonic can save people falling off a building, a turtle from getting crushed under a moving vehicle's wheel, and dodge bullets like they're flies but he gets tranquilized so easily? Gimme a break. The same goes for the scene where Sonic needs the assistance of his human friends Tim (a functional James Marsden) and Maddie (an okay Tika Sumpter) to get to the terrace of an SF building. In another scene, he's shown to be racing to the top of the pyramids on foot. (Come on!)Now, let's talk about the little wins. How Sonic gets his signature red-and-white shoes is conveyed through a sweetly written scene. Jim Carrey (as Dr. Robotnik) lands most of his funny lines and rises above the generic baddie. The set-pieces (especially the one that's shot around the seven wonders) are good fun - though the ""time-freeze"" style has now run its course thanks to Quicksilver, Flash, and many such characters in Hollywood movies. I'm glad they re-designed Sonic's appearance - he doesn't look a ""kid in a hedgehog suit"" anymore!I think I liked Detective Pikachu more, in terms of detailing the connect between its two lead characters. Here, the writing seems a tad too convenient. And the idea of Sonic being branded a people-stalker didn't go down well with me. This film is at best, a one-time watch, with lowered expectations."
tt11426232,6.0,"I was expecting this film to be a lot funnier. It isn't easy to do horror comedy and this fell flat in a few places. It was slightly ruined by all the PC references all throughout and it made the movie really aggravating. The main character calls out people for calling others fat, calls out racism, calls out homophobic people, a reporter comments on how strange it is to see men showing emotion....it's all just a bit much. Even Kiernan Shipka couldn't save this. She should have swapped roles with Olivia Holt. Might have been slightly better. Nevertheless I liked the end reveal, and parts of it were funny, but it had way more potential."
tt11426232,6.0,"Totally Killer is a 2023 slasher horror starring Kiernan Shipka(Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina),Olivia Holt(Girl Vs Monster),Lochlyn Munro (White Chicks)and Julie Brown(Tangled Animated Series).The plot follows a 17 year old girl named Jamie(Shipka) who is grieving the death of her mother Pam(Bowen) who was faithfully stabbed by a masked figure(sporting a Billy Idol mask)on Halloween night. When the masked killer tries to get Jamie,she runs into her friends invention,a photobooth that happens to be a time travelling machine and travels to 1987 to meet her mother and stop the killer from killing teenagers(especially 16 year old girls).Now Jamie must find out who the masked killer is and who is behind the mask?.Overall if you like Halloween,Back To The Future(which is mentioned alot in this film) and Scream then you'll get a kick out of this film. Not original but it's still a decent flick. Available now on Amazon Prime."
tt11426232,5.0,"I really appreciate to create something different and original into the slasher/teen/ comedy world. The main idea here is great. I mean trying to mix movies like Back to the future with the classic 80's teens slashers is cool. But the execution, acting and the 80's interpretation are poor.First, the movie does not deliver any message. Looks like the script was written by a gen Z or someone not older than 21. Why they send the message that in the 80's everything was wrong?Second, acting is horrendous, but still watchable as many slashers. I am not sure if they think around the 80's people were d*mb, maybe a bit, but definitely not like the acting in this movie.Last, I grew up in the 80's watching Friday the 13th, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street and Texas Chainsaw massacre. All four cult cIassics, and to be honest, the movie has nothing to do with the 80's slasher's spirit.Anyway, the movie is watchable but it could have been faaaaaaar better. A wasted opportunity to create a new great franchise."

Greetings again from the darkness. All Hallows' Eve approaches, so we know to expect the latest from Blumhouse Productions. What we didn't expect was a rare blend of comedy, horror, science fiction, and time-travel wrapped in 1980's nostalgia. Director Nahnatchka Khan (""Fresh Off the Boat"" creator) and a trio of co-writers, David Matalon, Sasha Perl-Raver, Jen D'Angelo (HOCUS POCUS 2, 2022), deliver a film that pays tribute to many that have come before, most notably BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) and HALLOWEEN (1978). Or maybe it's HOT TUB TIME MACHINE (2010) and SCREAM (1996). Either way, it's a good ride as we poke fun at the culture of 1987.Jamie (Kiernan Shipka, ""Mad Men"") is a teenager fed up with her overprotective mom (Julie Bowen, ""Modern Family""). However, this mom has history on her side when it comes to being protective. It's Halloween night, and thirty-five years ago, three girls in North Vernon, all friends of hers, were stabbed sixteen times. These days, the most popular Halloween costume in Vernon is that of the 'Sweet Sixteen Killer"" ... all black attire and a creepy blonde mask (one that seems like we should recognize, but I didn't).Of course, it's this year that the killer returns to claim another victim. While being pursued by the masked killer, Jamie heads to the rundown amusement park where the school science fair is set up. In my day, most science projects were done with a poster board and colored pens. Times have changed, and Jamie's smart friend Lauren (Troy Leigh-Anne Johnson) has transformed a photo booth into a time travel machine. Although it hasn't previously worked, the killer's knife plunging into the control panel sends Jamie back to 1987, where she meets her high school aged mother (Olivia Holt) and tries to prevent the original tragedy from ever occurring.It's at this point that the nostalgia kicks in. Most would agree the 1980's was not a pretty time, and it's even more cringe-inducing now. Pam is in a 'Mean Girls' type group called The Mollys (because they worship 80's icon Molly Ringwald), and there are cracks about the music, the clothes, and cocaine. But the best part is seeing how Jamie is aghast at the insensitivity and lack of political correctness in the era. Security is so lax, she easily passes as a Canadian exchange student, and spends an inordinate amount time telling people they shouldn't say or do something that was commonplace in the 80's and outlawed these days.The expected wise cracks counterbalance the violent murders, and for the most part, the film works just fine as an entertaining and fun trip down memory lane. As a bonus, it gives Kiernan Shipka a lead role that she can build upon.Available on Prime Video beginning October 6, 2023."
tt11426232,6.0,"I wanted so much to like this after reading good and bad reviews.There is so much to like and dislike about this horror comedy come time travel movie.The idea which is pretty cool but executed pretty badly there is a total lack of comedy and a total lack of horror it plods along from one skit to the next, the only saving grace is the lead aka sabrina spellman from the previously rebooted sabrina the teenage witch series who plays the wise beyond her years Jamie thrust back into 1987 by a very cool time travel photo booth!From there on in its a sub scream parody with some annoying teenagers getting wasted along the way as Jamie tries to stop a time travelling serial killer.The end sequence on the quantum drop fairground ride is by far the best part of the movie.If you have a spare hour and forty minutes free I recommend a rainy Sunday afternoon watch. It won't win any awards that's for sure!"
tt0463985,6.0,"This is an exciting narration of drifting auto racing with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets. It deals about a rebel American adolescent named Shawn Boswell(Lucas Black as a determined race-car driver) challenges his contender for a race cars, causing wreak havoc racing 195 mph through streets. To avoid the jail, his mother(Lynda Boyd) sends him Tokyo where is his father(Brian Goodman) as US military. Meanwhile the newcomer Shawn tries to ingratiate with Twinkie(Nathalie Kelley) and the world of racing in Japan, and hoping to join his extended group. In Tokio he discovers the underworld of the Yazuka and competes against Drift kingpin who is niece of mobster chief(Sonny Chiba who does a credible job).The picture mingles action-packed,drama, exciting pursuits cars, suspense, a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV. Flashy, noisy race-cars set in the Japan by the producers, -the famous Neal Moritz-of first part. Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency. All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage. Special cameo by Vin Diesel and appearance by Sonny Chiba, a Kung Fu idol of the 70s. Justin Lin's direction(previously made Annapolis and Better Luck tomorrow) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas. Justin Lin is directing the third part with Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. The movie gives new meaning to the term ¨Tuning¨and ¨Drifting¨. The flick will like to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely, it's a must see for cars fonds."
tt0463985,6.0,"When teenage road-racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black, who is too old for the part, but hey-ho) gets in trouble with the law for a third time, he avoids a jail sentence by going to live with his father in Tokyo; there, he becomes involved in the drift racing scene, coming to blows with DK (Brian Tee), the nephew of a powerful Yakuza.Tokyo Drift gets short shrift from some Fast & Furious fans because it steers the franchise away from the US street racing scene and because it doesn't star series regular Paul Walker. While it might be a slight step down from the previous entries, being a little too teen-centric with its predictably troublesome high school protagonist, I don't think it's all that bad. As a fan of all things Japanese, I can appreciate the colourful Tokyo setting, the Yakuza storyline, and, of course, all those oriental cuties in extremely short skirts.Director Justin Lin, who went on to helm parts 4, 5 and 6 in the series, handles the car scenes with aplomb, each race shifting up a gear in terms of adrenaline-pumping action. Drifting—sliding the car around sharp corners at high speed—adds a new level of excitement to the action, with a mountain road finale offering plenty of nerve jangling, edge-of-the-seat moments. The film closes with the reappearance of a familiar face, paving the way for further instalments."
tt6105098,6.0,"... with real, life-like animals. The lack of emotion and facial expressions makes you not get so attached.
Very much disliked the new song. Very much disliked Beyonce's unnesessary changes to the great song that is Can you feel the love tonight. Was also not too fond of other voice choises in this movie.
Six starts for the great story that The Lion King still is, but not even close to the same league with the original in the execution.
But I do not doubt that the children who have not seen the original would not love it."
tt6105098,6.0,"If only it could move us inside...Let's be honest, Disney has never been a non profit-making organization and Uncle Walt was a man of vision AND economical flair. Still, before turning into a voracious corporate blob, Disney was still the quintessential dream factory and nostalgia builder for many, many, many generations. And even for these direct-to-video sequels that spread all over the 2000s like a bad cold, some brain cells of imaginations were mobilized.But now Disney's not even trying to pretend, investing all the efforts on a pure technical level and the kind of marketing-that-speaks-for-itself. It is one thing to adapt fairy tales into live-actions, before ""Cinderella"", there was ""Enchanted"", ""Maleficent"" or even Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"". And yet Disney executives found the trick: it's not about adapting the fairy tale but the Disney version of it. Thorns are still invisible over the head with the two round ears but right now in 2022, it seems that ""awakening your inner child"" isn't a motto anymore but a formula.The formula could have interesting results: the 2016 ""Jungle Book"" film could center on little Mowgli and diverged from the 1967 film. Same with ""Dumbo"" or ""Aladdin"". But exclusively animal-centered movies like ""The Lion King"", ""Bambi"" or ""The Lady and the Tramp"" are a different challenge. You've got to humanize the way animals could act, react or display emotions. Take the kiss between Lady and the Tramp, the magic is not within the moment their mouths meet but the cute and genuine embarrassment that follows. You can't ""animate"" these emotions with live-action animals with all the technology of the world.Indeed if your purpose is that your lion looks real, you can't expand the range of facial expressions: remember in ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" the way Pongo and Perdita looked at each other at the end of the garden scene: reproducing that with real-looking animals is inconceivable, couldn't work, wouldn't work. And that's the ultimate wager of photorealistic remakes: achieve documentary-like realism with storylines that were designed for hand-drawn or at the very least CGI animation, ""Toy Story"" CGI I mean.And that leads to even more perplexing results when it comes to 'surreal' sequences like ""I Just Can't Wait to Be The King"" where two normal-looking cubs are casually running across pink flamingoes, or the moment that precedes Simba's epiphany where the figure of Mufasa is barely visible in the sky (not to mention that some lines were cut from the original). Now, maybe Disney takes for granted our passion for the ""Lion King"" and considers that we're there to ""fill the gaps"". It's true I did enjoy the film to the degree that it reminded of ""The Lion King"", which is a high point of my childhood, but at the end of the day, my mind was full of afterthoughts. To put it simple, I realized it was an enjoyment by proxy.The problem of ""The Lion King"" isn't that it's good or bad. It is certainly a remarkable achievement on the field of animation. The problem is that it is problematic. Yes I'm talking in circles but that's a circle Disney has just taken us into and that makes it rather impossible to figure what is wrong with these photorealistic films, we know there's something that doesn't look right, maybe on a pure reason-to-be way.""The Lion King"" is one of the classics of animation, a masterpiece that speaks highhy of the dedication of old-school Disney team of animators. 1995 would change the games with the first CGI and so in a way, ""The Lion King"" was the culmination of that traditional hand-drawn art. Not only that but its story, very simple and straightforward carried the gravitas and dramas or movie classics. Characters like Scar, Mufasa, Simba are all printed in our memories, the songs became pop culture monuments, scenes have been parodied countless times. ""The Lion King"" became a household name for Disney excellence. And certainly one of the greatest opening sequences of history, the shivers down your spine sent by the sight of Rafiki carrying little Simba is one of these moments you can't just 'duplicate'.As viewers pointed out, many things are missing: where is the friendly nod Mufasa gives Zazu? Or that hug between Rafiki and Mufasa? Mufasa comes across as a stone-faced patriarch posing like a library statue... and waiting for our nostalgic pheromones to instill some life in him .... Maybe we were just curious to see how they'd pull this out. I guess if I was told about an animated version of ""The Godfather"" no matter how ludricrous it sounds I would have given a shot. ""The Lion King"" was such a big deal, viewers did came to see and made it one of the highest grossing films of the year.Fair enough, but what's that does say exactly? That half the job was done and make a copy of something great to make something of equally promising greatness? The purpose of a remake is to bring something new. But ""The Lion King 2019"" doesn't bring anything new except for the realistic animation that doesn't look like an improvement anyway.. Scar looks like a washed out lion who shampooed his mane with paint thinner, without one tenth the suave charisma of the original. James Earl Jones' voice looks like he was only testing the microphone or was bored to death, which actually matched the look of the used-to-be majestic lion.And I swear the savannah and jungle never looked so dismal with tones of beige and yellowish green that reminded me of that Water Truce sequence in ""The Jungle Book"". So much for the bright colors and the escapism.... And the only thing visible right now are the thorns on the head, and the round ears have turned pointy... no it's not the devil, but a cow, a cash-cow."
tt6105098,6.0,"1994's 'The Lion King' is not just one of my favourite Disney films, it is also one of my favourite animated films and one of my favourites overall. Beautiful animation, some of Disney's most iconic songs and amazing score, an entertaining and powerful story with unforgettable moments, terrific voices (especially James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons) and joint best beginning to a Disney film alongside 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'.Disney's live action films are often frowned upon, they often have been described as pointless and many feel that Disney are running out of ideas. Can totally understand this, as the small handful that have been made so far have not really been necessary but the quality of them have varied. 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' were great and by far the best of the remakes, but the rest have left me mixed. Will admit to not really seeing the point of this version and was not massively impressed by the trailer, but saw it anyway being such a fan of Disney and because my sister desperately wanted to see it. Watching it way back when it first came out but with being behind with my reviewing it took me to now to review it, it was a little better than expected and not as bad as others have said. My sister did like it a lot better than me, with my feelings being quite lukewarm. Am really trying not to compare and try and judge it on its own terms, but sometimes it is hard when the quality of a remake, follow up or another adaptation is very far removed from something so good and that is the case with comparing both 'The Lion King' films.'The Lion King' (2019) does have good things. The best thing about it by a mile is the visuals, which are absolutely fantastic. Something of a technical achievement, with the scenery being breathtaking in every sense (""Circle of Life"" being a notable example) and the characters (excepting their eyes needing more expression) blend very realistically in a way where one gets the sense that this was a nature documentary. The score is still powerful, especially in the stampede and one of Disnney's most iconic tear-jerkers. Have always loved the songs, and with two exceptions they still make an impact. ""Circle of Life"" is truly awe-inspiring and the closest the film came to making me cry.Most of the dialogue has some moments of humour (Timon and Pumbaa) and tension (the hyenas). The story has its moments. Can not praise ""Circle of Life"" enough, Timon and Pumbaa are amusing and the stampede is intense, not goosebump-inducing though, even though everybody who has seen the original will know the outcome. Making the hyenas scarier and fleshing out the lionesses (a little) more were good moves. Actually thought that a lot of the voice work was not bad at all, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan being so much fun and by far the best faring of the voices, they were clearly having fun too with the improvising and their comic timing is full of exuberance not obvious elsewhere. Florence Kasumba's Shenzai is very different, the opposite in fact, to Whoopi Goldberg's, and the more sinister edge worked very well. James Earl Jones, the only voice actor to reprise his role, still has Mufasa's booming dignity and Donald Glover does quite well.Didn't care for some however. Was mixed on John Oliver, who is fun but overdoes it at times. Beyonce comes over as very out of place, her voice not fitting how Nala looks, and she even sounded bored. Chiwetel Eijofor, a good actor who was brilliant in '12 Years a Slave', was the biggest disappointment, found him too subdued for Scar and he is nowhere near as menacing or enjoys himself as much as Irons (whose voice work is some of the best for any Disney, and animated, film). While ""Circle of Life"", ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" and ""Hakuna Matata"" come off well (especially ""Circle of Life""), ""Be Prepared"" was bizarre and quite over the top, what a way to waste one of the greatest Disney villain songs. ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" was reminiscent of decent at best karaoke. ""Spirit"" is even worse, that did not fit within the film and was more an excuse for Beyonce to show off her vocal chops and have actually heard much better singing from her.Excepting the hyenas being scarier, some additional dialogue and the lionesses being more fleshed out, 'The Lion King' suffers from being too faithful and not having enough of its own identity. Too many of the scenes are near-carbon copies with only fleeting moments of heart and soul, mostly the film emotionally is very bland. The big death scene, heart-wrenching before, is treated in too throwaway a fashion. The additional dialogue and any interpolations are not for the better either and actually rather jar, while the cuts and changes were not necessary. The eyes and facial expressions for the characters, especially Scar, lack nuance and are at times borderline creepy.Summing up, found a lot to like but was disappointed overall. 6/10"
tt6105098,6.0,Well...the visual effects are groundbreaking but it lacks heart and flare - and feels soulless compared to the original. Donald Glover and Beyoncé felt like miscasts - it feels like they're reading lines from a sheet. See this remake for the visual effects; but go back and watch the original animated masterpiece in all its glory.
tt6105098,6.0,"I just got out of the Lion KingAnd I have to say it falls short of delivering for me. Elements of this new version are spectacular because of the quality of animation... But so much else was just mediocre... Starting with the poor voice talent. My favorite animated movies are brought to life by memorable distinctive voices... I loved what Burt Reynolds brought to All Dogs Go To Heaven, then Robin Williams set the bar with Aladdin, then we have Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, Mike Myers, then Eddie Murphy... The list is long but those films wouldn't have been the same without those voices. This new Lion King film has none of that... it's all just so flat.About 80% of this, is shot for shot/word for word the same as the 1994 classic. Although there is a subplot involving Scar and Sarabi from the Broadway show inserted.My next issue was the soundtrack... Again, there is nothing special here. The 1994 soundtrack was one of the all-time best. I hated Beyoncé singing Can You Feel The Love Tonight. I am not a fan of hers anyway, and her appeal is totally lost on me, but I can acknowledge when she is good as in Goldmember.Finally, and my biggest issue... The realistic non-expressions of the animals. Because you can't see happy or sad in their faces, you fully depend on the mediocre delivery of dialog. This was very distracting. The lion's faces do not show sad... happy... scared. This was like watching a two hour voice over.I found it less entertaining and engrossing than Aladdin and Dumbo, although at times I did enjoy this movie. I can safely say I will never watch it again, and will stick with my 1994 classic, So for me, this was just a mediocre unnecessary remake while showcasing perhaps the greatBest animation ever."
tt6105098,6.0,"You know the song, where ""can you feel the loooooove tonight"", and it looks like the lions are about to bang? Yeah, Beyonce kind of went all over the place with that and it sounded weird.Anyways, visually it was beautiful but characters just lacked emotion, I think this was a deliberate choice but it causes a lack of investment from a viewer's perspective. The cast were hit and miss, if you've seen it then you'll know who was great and who were rubbish.But yeah. At least it's not as bad as the mess that was Aladdin"
tt6105098,6.0,"For the people who are saying that Walt Disney stated in his will that he wanted the movies to be remade every 10 years: That is not even close to what he said. What is in his will is his desire to have the movies re-released into theaters in order for new generations to enjoy them. That was a common practice throughout Disney's history and he just wanted it to continue after he was gone.As far as this one goes, I was hoping for better. Nice CGI, the music is good, but the voice acting was barely passable and it lacked the emotion that was such a big part of the original. Overall very disappointing."
tt6105098,6.0,"In Africa, the lion cub Simba is the pride and joy of his parents King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi. Mufasa prepares Simba to be the next king of the jungle. However, the naive Simba believes in his envious uncle Scar that wants to kill Mufasa and Simba to become the next king. He lures Simba and his friend Nala to go to a forbidden place and they are attacked by hyenas but they are rescued by Mufasa. Then Scar plots another scheme to kill Mufasa and Simba but the cub escapes alive and leaves the kingdom believing he was responsible for the death of his father. Now Scar becomes the king supported by the evil hyenas while Simba grows in a distant land. Sometime later, Nala meets Simba and tells that the kingdom has become a creepy wasteland. What will Simba do?""The Lion King"" is an unnecessary remake of the 1994 animated film. The songs are boring and the nice images tell a story without soul. In the end, this version is beautiful but does not give any emotion to the viewer. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Rei Leão"" (""The Lion King"")"
tt6105098,6.0,"When you take one of the greatest stories to grace the silver screen and then combine it with exceptional visual effects, you'd expect the end product to be a wonderful contemporary refresh, ready to captivate young hearts and minds all over again. However, in the process of trying to out a slightly new spin on the Lion King, they've tampered with some elements that have detracted from the value of the film.So many reboots of classic films have fallen victim to the same adaption of storyline's to try and appease more contemporary audiences, but almost always end up being worse. The Lion King doesn't deviate from the original script and story as much as some other modern remakes, but it does still mix it up. Some of the changes arguably a small improvement, but some are significantly worse. The original film has so many subtle lessons, but sadly some of the best ones have been altered or removed entirely in this new version.Overall, the story is still close enough to the original to be decent, and the visual effects are quite remarkable. Although, the animals' faces appear somewhat dull, as the hyper realism doesn't allow for the same range of expression as the original cartoon.Overall, it's not a bad interpretation of the original, but a far cry from stellar heights of its predecessor. It's a movie that definitely didn't need to happen though."
tt6105098,6.0,"It's sad because this I was really looking forward to seeing what filmmakers Jon Favreau & Jeff Nathanson could do to make to make this photorealistic computer animation not live action remake stand out from Disney's classic animated 1994 film of the same name. Yet this film heavily influenced by Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' & Japanese anime ""Kimba the White Lion' felt like a rethread. Don't get me wrong, the story of Simba (Voiced by Donald Glover) having to retake his kingship does have some new things going for it. However the added backstory of how the villain got his name & how the famine start didn't really enhance the viewing experience. Honestly it lean more to becoming a bigger illogical plot hole on why the lionesses would continue to follow his lead knowing full well that he once challenge Mufasa (Voiced by James Earl Jones), force their queen for sex & continue to mistreated them. After all in this adaptation, Chiwetel Ejofor's version doesn't have the Machiavellian charm that Jeremy Irons brought in the original movie to make them trust him. To add onto that, Scar is not ruthless powerful enough to overtake their physical strength both in size and numbers if they rebelled. In the original he was. After all, he killed most of the Lion Guards including Nala (Voiced by Beyonce Knowles)'s father. In this movie, he's just an untrustworthy scrawny recluse whom cover story doesn't make much sense. He didn't even knock out the witness. Instead he exiled Zazu (Voiced by John Oliver) yet the bird still considering warn the lionesses of his lying. So you would think that the cover story would be expose long ago. On a similar beat, even if Scar didn't get cocky in deus ex machina way and expose the truth about Mufasa's death like an idiot. The lionesses didn't ask the wildebeests what happen in the first place seem odd. Even if the herd are sentient. Lionesses should be more willing to hear Simba out when he come back. He could expose who led him into the gorge to practice roaring. The only thing I can think of the pride thinking otherwise is if a Scar follower like Zira was introduce into the film. That or Simba having shown severe psychological issues or seem more physical mangy than Scar. After all, no lion will became a strong mane just by eating bugs. All this could had made the ending more logically. Still this remake needs more humor. I hate that the comic relief aspects are toned down to make everything gritty including the hyenas with no Ed. They now lack less personality, nowhere near expressive and are taken too serious. Yet the biggest letdown is how the film interpreted Hakuna Matata. According to Timon (Voiced by Billy Eichner) & Pumbaa (Voiced by Seth Rogen), there is no circle of life only a meaningless line of indifference. The way they said it, made responsibility free philosophy seem highly negative & nihilism than fun. No wonder they seem more coldblooded and open to help the carnivores killed their fellow animals. Don't get me wrong, they may have protection due to their closeness with Simba, but there still a famine going on. The chance of them getting eaten is high. Anyhow, the filmmakers still ruin the enjoyable humor with them. For example, jokes about being a pig is turn into a somber forced message about standing against bullies. It's unfunny PC comedy at its worst. Padding also made the movie suffer. 88 minutes runtime is now 2 hrs. The flick really wanted to prove that there is more of a Circle of Life than Hakuta Matata by painfully showing long sequences of fur travelling in the wind or a mouse wandering around. Talking about Circle of Life. I do find it odd that the lions has achieved harmony with the animals they eat by exodus hyenas under the pretense that they weren't part of it like an evil diaspora. The idea that they overhunt is outrageous. In real life, hyenas are vital components the ecosystem. They gotten a bad wrapped in these folktales. Simba should figure out a way to coexist with them. Another unique thing the movie could had done is use more of the Broadway Musical beside the trailer. At least, most of the original songwriters return to add new touches to their memorable hits even if the visuals to follow it are a bit lackluster. For example 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King' & ""Be Prepared"" sequences just doesn't compared to the fun original trippy animation with the cubs doing circus tricks or gusto delivery of strong fascism imageries of the hyenas. Then there is the opening of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" whom visuals also don't match the tone as it is still board daylight when sung. It also sucks that the triumphant score played over Simba racing back was replaced with ""Spirit"". It doesn't quite have the same heroic tone need for the audience to understand his journey. As for voice acting. Besides Ejofor being way off, most of the other performers were alright even if Beyoncé has her limits, Rogen can't sing and Jones sounds old. However it was very jarring to see the filmmakers remove nearly all range of human-like anthropomorphizing expressions. It made true to life creatures look so emotionless & stilted. Sadly making the animals move realistic also hurt the action as the film kinda screw up Simba's childhood pinning move. Even memorable spiritualism moments like Mufasa's physically spirit appearing in the clouds is tone down. Very little emotional punch. Regardless the CGI looks vivid accurate. Still overall I'll probably not see this remake again. The highest grossing animated movie of all time as of this writing is not really worth stepping foot on the lion den again and getting bit. That's for sure. I'll stick to the original."
tt2637276,6.0,"His certainly not a cuddly teddy that's for all but after one seriously successful first outing in 2012 it was always a given that everyone's (the only one?) favourite foul mouthed yet somehow endearing talking bear was going to make it back to a big screen close by and with that we now have Ted 2.After his biggest misfire yet in the potentially hilarious yet wrongly skewed A Million Ways to Die in the West (of which an alumni of makes a great cameo in this film), Seth MacFarlane finds himself back on familiar ground, which is in both a material sense, a comedic sense and also a still unfortunately self-indulgent directional sense that see's MacFarlane struggle to rid his 2 hour plus film of jokes that don't work and plot lines that feel like nothing more than time fillers. If there was ever a director in need of someone to cull his films of material that neither enhance or contribute to the tale at hand it's MacFarlane but to say the man doesn't deliver some comedic gold in this enjoyable romp would be a lie.While you'll often find yourself ashamed at what brings forth fits of laughter here, MacFarlane as he is well known to do, mixes juvenile humour with far more wide reaching topical funnies, from everything from civil rights through to his usual pop culture insights, nothing is out of his reach. Within the films bloated runtime there are moments of pure gold that make Ted 2 succeed to the level it does, much like its predecessor and with the continued chemistry shared between Whalberg's well-meaning yet daft John and the MacFarlane voiced Ted Clubber-Lang (yes Ted now has a last name) at the same high levels the films many sins can be forgiven thanks to their often game saving banters. The addition of Amanda Seyfried is also a bonus to the film, her willingness to poke fun at herself a particular highlight.The narrative of Ted 2 is anything but fantastic and the reappearance of Giovani Ribisi's teddy obsessed villain Donny is almost a movie breaker but Ted 2 has enough wit and chemistry to save itself from all the low denominator humour and awkwardly edited grove that surrounds it and in the end provides some very decent comedic entertainment. In saying this it may be time for all involved to move onto other things with MacFarlane in particular in need of something a little meatier than he has been dishing up over the last few years.3 Tom Brady home invasions out of 5"
tt2637276,5.0,"Living teddy bear, Ted (Seth MacFarlane) has finally married his girlfriend Tami-Lynn McCafferty (Jessica Barth) with his friend John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) as his best man having been divorced from Lori for six months. About a year after the wedding Tami-Lynn and Ted start experiencing marital difficulties and on the advice of a friend Ted floats the idea of adopting a child with Tami-Lynn who's receptive to the idea. After learning Tami-Lynn is infertile due to years of drug use, the two decide to go the adoption route which not only fails, but leads to several chain reactions in Ted's life as he's technically ""property"" and not a person according to the state. The two enlist the help of a local law firm and are given recent Law School grad Samantha Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) who hits it off with John. Meanwhile, Ted's stalker Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) is now working at Hasbro as a janitor and convinces Hasbro's CEO Tom Jessup (John Carroll Lynch) to bank roll the opposition to Ted's case in the hopes of making Ted's rights forfeit and mass producing duplicates so Donny can finally have one of his own.2012's Ted was indisputably the year's biggest comedy release of that year making $550 million against a $65 million budget and allowing writer director Seth MacFarlane to stretch his success beyond his prime time animated shows like Family Guy and American Dad to other areas including his revival of Cosmos and eventually his Star Trek homage The Orville. With Ted being a success, it was pretty much a given that there'd be a sequel which MacFarlane commenced following the disappointing returns on his western comedy A Million Ways to Die in the West. Initially written as a road trip comedy where in Ted and John would smuggle a load of marijuana across the United States, the premise was scrapped early on due to similarities with the 2013 comedy We're the Millers. Eventually the focus shifted to one of Ted proving himself as a person under the eyes of the law, necessitating the inclusion of a lawyer character and writing out Mila Kunis' character Lori from the last movie. When the movie was released in June 2015, its grosses fell short of its processor making $120 million less domestically at $81 million but thanks to the international market it did eventually manage to get to $216 million worldwide. MacFarlane hasn't directed another film since Ted 2 but did direct some episodes of The Orville that are reasonably well regarded so there hasn't been any adverse fallout from its underperformance. The movie itself, it's basically just more of the same minus the freshness and the recurring issues that plague most comedy sequels.Ted 2 begins fairly okay within the first 20 minutes as it opens with a humorous wedding for Ted and Tami-Lynn and transitions into a Busby Berkeley-esque musical number that serves as out opening credits. But then we have the other things, like John now divorced from Lori effectively undoing any of his character development and resetting him to square one (never a good sign for a comedy sequel). On top of the issues with sequelitis we also have many sequences that are lifted wholesale from episodes of Family Guy such as the sperm spilling scene from the episode Sibling Rivalry and even the main plot follows many of the major beats of the series seventh episode Brian: Portrait of a Dog where in a talking dog fought a legal battle for his civil rights. And when it's not copying scenes from Family Guy, it's copying scenes from other comedies like the ""Mess Around"" driving sequence from Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.I know Family Guy has a history of wholesale lifting sequences, dialogue, and set pieces from other TV shows and movies and just placing their own characters in it, and considering it's a 22 minute TV episode with commercials it is what it is. But a movie doesn't follow the same rules as TV and when you recycle jokes your and setups your audience saw on TV for free and now make them pay theater prices to see them on the big screen it shows a remarkable amount of contempt for your audience. MacFarlane isn't the only one guilty of this either, because South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker tried to pull the same thing with their movie Team America: World Police that featured a number of jokes regurgitated from their TV show, and it was stupid there too.That's not to say there aren't some jokes that work as some of the cameos are occasionally funny and MacFarlane and Wahlberg still have good chemistry, but for every moment that works there's others that just don't. The movie brings back Giovani Ribisi's Donny again and like the last movie he's not funny and is just odd and off-putting but some of the scenes he shared with John Carroll Lynch were mildly amusing, Amanda Seyfried's Sam Jackson (guess which joke they make) is just kind of there, and a lengthy sequence in Comic-Con only served to remind me how much better this was done when Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, and Seth Rogen did it in Paul.Ted 2 feels like an obligation sequel. It's cobbled together from leftover parts of both the first movie and MacFarlane's TV shows while still having the same problems with dated reference humor that has made the film age poorly. I say this as someone who likes MacFarlane's work, he can do better than this."
tt2637276,6.0,"Ted 2 now focuses on the titular anthropomorphic teddy bear in, having his own life of marriage and plans ahead of getting a non-biological child. This leads to a strangely interesting conflict about gaining civil rights to a teddy bear. And it's stranger that at some point the movie does take it somewhat seriously, and eventually goes back to its crass hijinks. It's nice, but nothing much compelling in the end, because what obviously overshadows it is definitely the outrageous laughs. But even the degree of laughs suffers the same problem; it's full of energy at first then it awkwardly mutes its lighter tone for its climax. Fans of the first may get the same pleasure that they seek, but there is really nothing special to it, either.The first half really has the strongest amount of funny moments and also brought some intrigue to the story's center. But the movie apparently cannot decide what exact approach it is generally taking. The outrageous comedy is still everywhere, but whenever it stops by focusing on its themes, it really takes it seriously, like it actually believes that it is saying something important. But the movie hardly earns anything to deserve that attention. It's just shifting from its outrageous nature to a sudden gravity back and forth. Even for a comedy that is actually just fooling around, it stills displays a mind of uncertainty. There is also some bits of attempting to replicate Broadway; with dance numbers and a song. Can't tell if that's one of the movie's way of tripping or the director just wants to show off that he can do a musical. Either way, it rather feels nothing more than a random filler. The movie is also a little too long, the movie hitting the same major problem of the first film by setting up a climax that it's supposed to drive tension. It never felt right for the film, even worse, it's more like a rehash, reintroducing the same villain except it takes place in a different location. It's rather awkward and tedious than effective.The sentiment doesn't felt convincing enough for the movie's true colors, but then it's all about the humor. And if the humor works, then there is a worthy roar of laughter to get from this film. Predictably raunchy, pot fueled and consists pop culture references; that will certainly be enjoyed if you understand the language of a Seth MacFarlane comedy. It's fun if it really tries to be fun. The performances from its lead actors are still a joy to watch. MacFarlane still manages to put energy to the talking teddy bear and Mark Wahlberg is still committed to fool around as Ted's man child best friend.Ted 2 doesn't bring the same surprise of the first one, but if you're in for more outrageous laughs from this profane talking teddy bear, then it won't be a problem, as long as you're not expecting too much. The film does try to bring on an important theme, but it's not as effective or as strong as it wanted to be; it does make some interesting arguments, just doesn't have any powerful or at least earned conclusion to it; but hell, who would exactly take that seriously, anyway? Well, no more than the movie itself. It should have been shorter, the storyline should have been tighter, and the third act should have tried harder than repeating its predecessor. Again, it can be really funny, it just suffers handling its ideas better."
tt2637276,6.0,"Ted 2 does exactly what it set out to do. It delivers a bunch of laughs built primarily on crude, in-your-face humor and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Seth MacFarlane proves once again that he has his finger firmly on the pulse of his target demographic because the theater was in stitches throughout most of the film. That being said, a comedy doesn't have to sacrifice cinema in order to deliver laughs. I think the first movie was a prime example of that, as it was a genuinely good movie in addition to being hilarious. Instead, MacFarlane turns this movie into a live-action version of Family Guy. The plot is choppy and it essentially feels like a series of random skits, pieced together to form the semblance of some over-arcing plot. It was easily worth watching because it was hilarious but I expected a quality film closer to that of the first one."
tt2637276,6.0,"If there was a 6.5, I would give it. Because there was a lot to like in this movie. I like Mark Wahlberg. I like the bear. I like Amanda Seyfried. And there were a lot of good laughs in this movie. Good one-liners, and good recurring gags.However, it just wasn't enough to make up for a horrible plot. The plot is lifted from ""Miracle on 43rd Street."" But it is not Christmas, Ted is not Santa. Somehow Ted does not rise to the mythical level of Santa, this is not a movie for kids. and the movie falls flat. Markie Mark is same as ever, and I do enjoy him. Kudos to Amanda Seyfried, who tries so hard to make the romance story line work. But I could never get past the fact that I was watching MW and AS and a wise-cracking stuffed bear. Some good laughs? Yes. A good story? Not even close."
tt0463854,6.0,"As far as the action/suspense goes, a 7/10 would have been more appropriately. But as far as the common sense and the plot holes are to be taken into that account/rating, than a 6/10 is still a good rating in my eyes.Let me explain. Apart from the obvious ""let's shake the camera to create some tension/horror"", which made me more often nauseous than really scared, quite frankly, the real let downs in this movie are the plot holes and the portrayal of the military. Now I'm not a military guy myself, but to portray them in a manner, that not only makes them look stupid -> SPOILERS: they let the kids get out of the military zone just like that ... oh and how convenient, that they find them exactly at the time when they themselves have found their mother! Not to mention the unguarded mother back at the military zone, where anybody can walk into, to get infected! It's open (mad) house ... enough already! Seriously, this does spoiler a lot of the fun, one can have with the movie ... or could have had, in that case. As for example the introduction in the movie. The guilt ridden father is a great theme, that runs throughout the movie. And the whole beginning is shot in a really great way. But as I said, it doesn't hold up to that unfortunately.And yes the ending is quite clear ... although still some people try to make sense of it. It doesn't matter (SPOILER again, watch out, don't read if you haven't watched the movie, I'm going to talk about the ending), how the pilot got infected or how the helicopter crashed ... it's just a scheme to set-up a possible ""28 months later"" (or whatever it will be called)! So Paris, here we come!"
tt0463854,6.0,"It's 28 weeks after the release of the virus and about 6 months after the first movie. The US Army is occupying London after the zombies have all supposedly died of starvation. Don (Robert Carlyle) narrowly escaped the zombies by abandoning his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) and others. Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and Flynn (Harold Perrineau) are a couple of the military personnel under the command of General Stone (Idris Elba). Scarlet (Rose Byrne) is an Army doctor. Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) are Don's kids who return from Spain after missing the initial outbreak. The kids escape the zone to find their semi-zombified mother at home. She's infected but isn't turning.The first one has a simple powerful originality. The originality could never be repeated. I do like Don's duplicity and personal demons from his escape. I wish the movie stayed with him as he struggles with his inner demons and possibly finds redemption. The bigger ideas are lost when he turns. It becomes a simple zombie action movie. I just miss Robert Carlyle as the main character in the second half. When time is invested in him being the main survivor character, the movie needs to follow his story. The action is bigger and more confused. It loses the cleanliness of the original horror. The simplicity of the original lends itself to be a great horror. There is probably a political statement being made about American occupation but it doesn't really dig that deep."

You rarely see the aftermath of an apocalypse with this interesting premise and conflicted characters it really starts well. But once the inevitable returns so does the usual clichés in this genre."

It's entertaining, but just barely."
tt5442430,6.0,"Life was a solid horror/alien movie with a wonderful cast and well shot visuals. It is not a masterpiece especially considering the genre's many great entries, including the alien which seemed to be something that this film has modelled after. I liked how this film in contrast to Alien seemed very plausible and realistic, focusing on the 'science' part of sci-fi. The mission in search of extra terrestrial living organisms is a very interesting topic and this film made the possibilities of this seem so much more plausible. At the same time Life also brings up an interesting idea of how little we know about the universe that we live in and how inexperienced we are. How alien life form could be so different to our expectations and hence the debate of whether we should explore and the consequences of human curiosity. It carried a good amount of intensity and suspense and was gory and terrifying at times.The performances were quite good, the cast is pretty great though so there was no surprise there but it did fall flat in writing though, not that it was poor but it's a very straight forwards and rather clichéd trope that we've seen many times even though it was indeed well done."

The mission is to analyse some soil samples from Mars and in the process the crew discover a dangerous 'octopusy' like alien life-form.The Alien (they name 'Calvin') grows very quickly and slowly picks off the crew in it's attempts to survive. The alien is fairly scary but I don't think will measure up to some other film monsters, and I'm not sure if I'm ever going to enjoy calamari again.The plot is heavily inspired by the original Ridley Scott 'Alien' film, while the very heavy CGI opening scenes are heavily inspired by 'Gravity'. The zero gravity 'floaty' scenes are well filmed and very effective. The sound-track is very atmospheric but is 'bigger' than the film.In summary, the film is watch-able but there is a very predictable twist at the end and the film is ultimately forgettable in favour of better examples."
tt5442430,5.0,"""Life"" being an ""Alien"" ripoff should not come as a surprise to anybody; it's been marketed that way since day one. Compared to the majority of what the genre has been spewing out lately, though, a derivative sci-fi thriller can be seen as a breath of fresh air. And in many ways, ""Life"" succeeds as one. It's fluidly directed, well-acted, sporadically suspenseful, and thoroughly entertaining. The space setting lends itself to impressive visuals and claustrophobic scenarios, of which ""Life"" has no shortage. The problems with the film lie underneath the surface.Part of what made ""Alien"" such a terrifying experience was its bleak atmosphere. The exploration of a cold, desolate, seemingly uninhabitable planet; traversing through the long, white corridors of the ship; the lingering sense of unease, not knowing where the alien was at any given moment. ""Life"" is more streamlined, its action taking place entirely on board an indistinctive space shuttle. Some scenes serve as clear homages to ""Alien,"" such as David (Jake Gyllenhaal) floating through uncertain corridors mirroring Dallas' maneuvering of the airlocks, and one of the crew members being in isolated danger, forcing the others to decide whether or not to assist them and risk endangering the rest of the crew. These scenes work well enough to generate a modicum of suspense, but their impact is severely reduced because of the fact that we've seen it before. It's difficult to be truly scared when you know exactly what's going to happen to who and when.Perhaps the biggest issue with ""Life"" is its characters. None of them have distinct personalities; we're hardly given a chance to get to know them. Some of the most effective scenes in ""Alien"" were simply watching the crew sitting around and chatting - we saw how they interacted with each other under normal circumstances, we noticed their quirks firsthand, we understood what their priorities were early on; so when crap started hitting the fan, those subtle characterizations made the tension all the more visceral and relatable. In ""Life,"" we're introduced to caricatures who spout bland dialogue and do consistently stupid things. All we really know about them is their jobs, so you don't feel an impact when any particular character bites it.Still, ""Life"" is too well-made to be completely dismissed. Sci-fi horror fans will likely find enjoyment from a one-time watch, if only for the constant callbacks to ""Alien."" It fails to break any new ground, but it's a perfectly serviceable and moderately thrilling addition to the genre."

Nevertheless, she does a decent job here as a poor ignored girl whose birthday is forgotten. Then we have a bunch of juvenile jokes, designed to appeal to, you guessed it, juveniles. I think a lot of the people who liked this movie, see this time in their lives in the characters. Once again, like with the breakfast club, we have all these persons with prescribed traits, interconnected. They come and they go, but there is not real connection.

This film has themes about coping with the subject of sex, shyness and inexperience, and true love.
The story is fresh and cheerful and occasionally amusing with a goofy sense of humour. The script is sharp, with a keen sense for the idiom of teenspeak. As ever, Molly Ringwald is natural and appealing in this coming-of-age drama about a bright-eyed girl turning 16. It has a funny performance from Anthony Michael Hall as the dork, and a handsome turn from Michael Schoeffling.
It is a little slow moving and the dialogue at times lulls but there are plenty of daft distractions to smile at and some great 80s pop songs as a binding agent."
tt1637688,6.0,"In the future, science has stopped aging at 25. Everybody is allowed one more year. However there is the ability to transfer your time. Your life becomes currency and you work to earn time. In that way, society has divided into people who live day to day and people who are basically immortal. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives day to day in the ghetto. Rachel Salas (Olivia Wilde) is his mother. One day he rescues a rich Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who is tired of life and leaves him 116 years of time.This is a great sci-fi concept. It's awkward to try to keep track who are older and everybody's relationships. However I feel there's something missing. The concept wasn't exploited enough. Half the time it's trying to explain the world rather than showing you the world. And the 'ghetto' isn't as rough as it ought to be. When the clock ticks down to zero, I can't believe that people aren't going crazy robbing everybody that they can. The idea of an apocalyptic world isn't pushed far enough."
tt1637688,5.0,"Let me play the nitpicker here: First off, the idea that your ""clock"" is always visible is pretty stupid to begin with. That's like us walking around with a bank balance stamped across our arm. It should become visible with a touch on the wrist or something.The fact that all you have to do is touch arms to take time is stupid, ,too. There's no way to make it voluntary? No kind of security? I mean, it's you life for crying out loud!! Will and Sylvia robbing their first time bank. How did they get a hold of an armored truck in the first place? All you have to do to rob a bank and get all the time you want is crash into the front? If it was that easy, everyone would be doing it! There are people dying in the streets everyday and no one has thought to do this? Olivia's death, it was too cliché. Literally missing it by like a second? Come on!Why would the lead Minute Man want to 'fight' Will? (also, they never made that concept clear until they sat at that table) Why wouldn't he just take his time and be done with it? He had nothing to gain from it. It was just weak writing in my opinion.And what happened to that subplot of Will's father? They kept alluding to some great reveal or that Leon knew something Will didn't, but then the film just forgot about it. Are they trying to tell us that Will's altruism was hereditary? When Will got to Greenich, what was his plan? It seemed to me like he was just buying his way into high society and playing with the rich. I couldn't figure out what his endgame was going to be.This one is again not a flaw, but can we all agree that car crash into the ditch looked just ridiculous? Terrible CGI and not believable at all.And how they got the jump on Weiss, Sylvia's father. He's got more security around him than the President, but all you need is a pair of sunglasses to get the jump on him? Does the ""security team"" consist of random people who do not know each other? Then once you got him to lead you upstairs, all his bodyguards did what? Went out for lunch? Why didn't they go after him? Why weren't they waiting downstairs for him? Why weren't any alarms sounding? Stupid. So you have a million years in you hand and presumably only an hour on you wrist, yet you don't take any for yourself? I guess handing a little girl 999,999 years, 11 months, and 28 days just doesn't have the same resonance.You can pay one year to get into Greenwich zone ... or you just walk in, there is no security or guards anyway.""Wire me my per diem- wait, never mind ..."" that was stupid. All he had to do was put his arm out. Also, it made it obvious from that point how Leon was going to die.Conclusion: If you're the kind of viewer who can overlook flaws like this, I can see someone finding this movie enjoyable, it had an interesting premise, with a good cast, but plots holes you could drive a monster truck through."
tt1637688,6.0,"Everyone is on a clock. What keeps the general population from devolving into id-driven mobs is the fact that no one knows how much time they have left on theirs. If you had a constant reminder on your forearm, however, you might simply go about your life in a desperate attempt to prolong it. Or not.Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake) is a 28-year-old factory worker whose one year clock started and aging stopped, like everyone else in the film, when he turned 25. He and his 50 year-old mother Rachel (played by Olivia Wilde) live in the ghettos of Dayton hoping to earn and save enough to at least see the next day. All while wages in the ghetto are constantly going down and the cost of living is constantly going up. Then, while out drinking with his friend Borel (played by Johnny Galecki), he learns of a man with more than a century left on his clock who has unadvisedly advertised his good fortune while in the same bar as Will and Borel. A local time-thief enters the picture and, rather than retreat like his friend did and advised him to do, Will comes to the aid of the fortunate stranger. While saving his life was all for naught, the stranger gives Will all the time left on his clock before allowing the time on his own clock to run out while he's sitting on a bridge overlooking a dry river basin.""Time is money"" was a phrase first coined by Benjamin Franklin. While the idea of reversing that concept to ""money is time"" is interesting, I don't believe the cast was up to the challenge of exploring it. Whatever success Justin Timberlake might've had in supporting roles, he doesn't have what it takes to be the leading man. Amanda Seyfried, whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film, is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason. Perhaps an independent production could provide actors with genuine talent, who are young enough to look the part, but this is closer some sort of CW melodrama."
tt1637688,6.0,"This movie is fine if you don't think too much. First of all, there is the fundamental premise that one can use time as currency. Who decided that at 25 years of age the denizens of the future, would die unless the begged, borrowed, or stole time. We are never given that explanation but all people have a sort of countdown clock on their forearms. Those who have accumulated time become hunted by those who wish to steal it. There is also a set of sectors where people have as much time as they want. Everyone stops aging at 25 and either dies or maintains that age (hence mothers may be 100 years old and look just like their 25 year old children). Also, a grasp of the wrist of another person can transfer time. Justin Timberlake is given a huge cache of time by a suicidal man and sets out to avenge the death of his mother, who has succumbed before she can get ""reloaded."" He takes a spoiled young woman with him and they go around blowing up the system. They are pursued by a sort of latter day Javert, who has dedicated his miserable life to being a timekeeper, arresting those poor souls who are just trying to live. Anyway, it's all pretty absurd, unless you look at it as a parody of our own grasping society and our social classes. Pretty far fetched, even if disbelief is suspended."
tt1637688,6.0,"Live forever or die trying. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried star in the new sci-fi action film ""In Time"". Will Salas (Timberlake) and Silvia Weis (Seyfried) live in a futuristic world where time is the currency. In this world, people stop aging at 25. Once they turn 25, they only have one year to live, unless they find a way to get more time.Will lives in the ghetto where people constantly are timing out (running out of time and dying), while Silvia lives in New Greenwich where people have centuries. It's extremely dangerous to have too much time; those with centuries are usually accused of stealing and are immediately killed.When Will is accused of murder, he takes Silvia hostage and they run from the timekeeper (Cillian Murphy). Several times, they find themselves cutting it close with only seconds left on their clocks.The concept is extremely unique and innovative, which made me think it was going to be an ""Inception""-type film. However, it was disappointing to see ""In Time"" fall short of my expectations. It pains me to say this, but Justin Timberlake should not have been chosen for the role of Will Salas. He just can't pull off the character of a tough guy from the ghetto. Amanda Seyfried is decent as Silvia, but she and Timberlake don't have much chemistry.I also don't think the script was very well written, which causes Timberlake and Seyfried to be even less believable as their characters. In addition, the characters are not developed enough; it's difficult to get a sense of whom these people, from opposite worlds, really are.I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie. I was distracted and the movie felt much longer than it actually is. For all of these reasons, I give ""In Time"" a 6 out of 10. Great idea. Poorly executed."
tt1637688,6.0,"You should know that this movie will never delve into deep psychological nor sociological studies. It will never satisfy anyone who wanted something deep and thoughtful. What is is, is an entertaining movie with a very good idea to back it up. While some may argue that Timberlake might not have been the best choice as lead actor, I think he does a good job with the role he has on hand here.You also get Alex Pettyfer in a role that hints at him being more than a pretty face. Still not a real challenge of course, this may lead to more serious roles for the guy. While the film got quite a lot of momentum during the ""Occupy"" movement (you can see why, after you watched the movie), it will never be able to get close to movies like Blade Runner and others. But try not to judge it like that and you will have a good time watching this tension filled Sci-Fi Thriller."
tt1637688,6.0,"This is a really cool idea for a film. A day in the future when the commodity of value is not cash or gold, it is time. Everyone gets to live to age 25. After that you have one year to live, or less. It all depends upon whether you use all your time credits or you earn more. Regardless, if you live to age 100, or longer, your body physically remains looking twenty five.On the plus side is Justin Timberlake coming back and showing that his misstep in Bad Teacher (2011) was just one of those embarrassing Hollywood screw ups. Timberlake has real drama and acting talent and is definitely here for the long haul. (Too bad Elvis was never given such chances.) Timberlake gave us a glimpse of his depth last year in The Social Newtwork (2010) , but his talents were not fully developed for Friends with Benefits (2011). The script starts with the eerie, sobering reminder, and all too familiar words, ""We don't have time...we don't have time..."" Think if today you had to buy everything with time, instead of bank credit or cash. Coffee costs four minutes. A bus ride costs an hour. A car costs two years. People can give or take time from each other. Just don't run out of time or you will die on the spot. If this were real, would you treasure and spend time more wisely? The real interesting question may be that time really is the currency we live by now, we just fail to see it that way. The simple fact is that you can earn countless piles of cash and gold in this world, but you really cannot buy time. Despite the wealthy in today's world sometimes being able to cheat a few years with better health care, we all are going to die in the same average years.While the script is the superficial tale of Will Salas (Timberlake) and his Mom (Wilde) trying to pass time in a futuristic world, the messages of the film go far deeper. It is really a tale of class warfare. People who have time, like the mega ""eonaire"" Phillipe Weis (Katheiser) and his rich daughter Sylvia (Seyfried) and those who constantly struggle to keep time (or run out of it) like the Salas family. Will gets the chance to move up into a better time zone thanks to a man who has just decided that after a hundred years or so, he prefers to ""time out."" He leaves Will the prophetic warning ""Don't waste my time."" How Will chooses to spend his time, for himself or for the benefit of all, is now the story.I really did not mind that the future depicted in this film was not futuristic looking and all the cars were vintage 1970's models with updated lighting and electric sounding motors. It saved a huge budget rather than try to make the world look like it probably will in 2013 or so. And I think the point was that the future is really now.As an entertaining film, my 7.5 rating is spot on. As a thought provoking experience, I might have given it a 10.0. After seeing this film, you should go out and visit with friends. Your own clock is ticking down. Are you really using it wisely? Unlike the time down clock on the arm of the people in this film, you never know when your time is about up.This film...it's worth your time."
tt1637688,6.0,"It's time to review this dystopian sci-fi thriller film. Written & directed by Andrew Niccol, the movie open up in 2169, where people are born genetically engineered with a digital clock on their forearm. To help avoid overpopulation, when people turn 25 years old, they stop aging and their clock begins counting down from one year; when it reaches zero that person ""times out"" and dies instantly. Time has become the universal currency. The country has been divided into ""time zones"" based on the wealth of the population. The movie focuses on two specific zones: Dayton, a poor manufacturing area where people like Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) live day-to-day and New Greenwich, the wealthiest time zone, where Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfield) can live nearly forever. This is an everyday struggle for Will until he ends up rescuing a rich guy named Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer). For this favor, Henry gives his time to Will, so that he take revenge for the death of Will's mother (Olivia Wilde). Now with plenty of time, he plans to give the people, the freedom of their lives, by making the upper class pay. Too bad, Will Salas is a hypocrite. He delays all this, so that he can spent time, buying nice cars, eating at fancy restaurants, trying to hook up with Sylvia, attending rich people parties and playing high stakes poker. It takes forever to get to the 'Robin Hood' plot that the movie trailer promise us. Lots of filling scenes that slow down the pace to a crawl. The movie plot is a thinly-veiled allegory for the Occupy Wall Street movement against the 1%. It's supposed to be social commentary about the growing global divide between the haves and have-nots. It's an intriguing premise, but unfortunately, the movie follows a really predictable formulaic plot, ending with lousy satisfying conclusion. Robbing banks will solve the economy?!? What? This is a good example of Hollywood not understanding economics. Do they think, robbing banks would solve the economy? It would make it worst. ""Is it stealing if it's already stolen?"" quotes the movie. Yes, it is. This movie is just a mess; trying to add a Bonnie and Clyde type heist story with political overtones doesn't work. There was no depth to the movie's resolution other than everyone deserves equality. The movie lacks good exposition. It's too heavy-handed, explaining a lot of things that didn't need to. The movie takes a lot of Artistic License in science and economic causing a lot of things to make no sense. Obviously made for a teen demographic, everybody in the film cast is beautiful as hell. It's implied, they are genetically engineered, but still, I didn't know, the really poor, can still look amazing gorgeous, despite only have hours or minutes to live. It's really jarring. I do hope that the film makers know that aging isn't a gene. Even if the rich can live forever, the skin will still be thinner and wrinkled by time manly due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Aging can't be stop. Only postponed. Also, why 25 year old is the cut-off date? Isn't that the age frame where most people do the most work? Why not, use the ones that you selection to be born, longer like until 50 or 60 year old until terminating them? They isn't no point to eliminate them in the first place. You kill a lot of young people, who does the majority of the work? There is no reason why children should even being born, if they're genetically engineered and nobody dies from old age. Another thing, why waste resources waiting for the children to reach 25 in the first place? Just create a fully grown male and female. It doesn't make sense why people still need to eat and drink, when they don't feed on energy. How can you get alcohol poisoning if disease are eradicate in this world? There are so many loose-ends that I can go on, about like what happen to the time, when people die due to mauling to their bodies. If they are genetically engineered, couldn't they just get fix up? The movie even forget sub-plot like what happen to Will's late father. The movie is also very insulting. A lot of over the top rich people have Jewish last names pushing the Greedy Jew stereotypes. The acting is mediocre. Justin Timberlake is pretty lackluster. The best actor in the film, had to be Cillain Murphy. Amanda Seyfield is just there to be the love-interest, despite Will kidnapping her at gunpoint and almost killing her in a car accident. How romantic, Stockholm Syndrome, Patty Hearst right there. How stupid! The good things about the film is the score, the action, and the set design. It really does look futuristic. I love the time fighting race against the clock tense moments. Still, there were a lot of stupid suicidal disregard of time allowance by characters that makes you wonder. Are these people, stupid? Will himself keeps coming into large quantities of time, then giving it away and leaving himself only a few hours or even minutes instead of a few years. There is a strongly reminiscent of this film to other media works. Due to that reason, the film got often dealt with copyright lawsuits. One is Harlan Ellison whom believe that the film's plot was based on his 1965 short story 'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman"". Another is Lee Falk who believe it was taken from ""Mandrake and the Goldman: Time is Money"", a comic issue. Many of the elements of In Time can be found in the 1987 short film 'The Price of Life' & the Hannu Rajaniemi's novel 'The Quantum Thief' as well. Overall: There isn't enough time in the world, to get me to re watch this bad movie. You're probably better off just watching 1997 Gattaca than wasting time and money on this movie."
tt1637688,6.0,"If there's something instantly captivating about a movie - it's when the idea's new. In ""In Time"", the plot revolves around the interesting idea that time is the new currency and rules the world like the Dollar once used to. The poor must fight to live for a few days, the rich are practically immortal.This could have become a new scifi milestone, if it wasn't for the poorly executed script, stiff acting and highly predictable plot. The scenes are thrown together and feel like reenacted from typical ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", two against the world and enemy of the state type movies. None of the scenes seem original or well executed. Actions and reactions by the actors seem unnatural or rushed, unrealistic even. Some character development just feels plain wrong. Not because of the plot, but because the characters don't seem to be portrayed very well. Although a scifi movie, realism is still necessary. ""In time"" shows a world that is not believable and many scenes seem straight stupid.It's not a great movie. If not for the cool plot idea and the likable main character, it wouldn't be worth watching at all. But if you want to see a world, albeit fake, where people fight over time to survive, give it a go."
tt0091203,6.0,"As a child, in the late eighties, I loved this movie and I was able to watch it over and over again countless times. Three decades later I spent two hours in nostalgic boredom. This movie can be good only to a child, and ironically, it's R rated and not intended for children. It is based on an interesting idea about the existence of a small number of immortals scattered around the globe and destined to wait for a certain time when they'll meet and fight each other until there's only one left. Unfortunately, this premise is not well-developed and it's full of holes and illogicalities. The wooden acting of Christopher Lambert is plain boring, while the brilliant Sean Connery is totally underutilized and Clancy Brown is at the same time the main villain and a comic relief, a combination that could work well only in comedies and which has no place in this movie. Duels are probably the weakest point of the film, as the swordsmen who have had centuries to perfect their skill seem like five-year-olds fighting with sticks. As far as the effects are concerned, I am aware that they could not have been much better in 1986, but they are largely unnecessary and without them the film would be much more convincing. Not everything has to be explicitly shown to the viewer, and a good director would find a way to replace more difficult effects with the imagination of the viewer. Objectively, the only real quality here is Queen's music that stretches through the entire movie. Subjectively - I do not like Queen. The main reason why I did not give a lower rating is a few really hilarious scenes that I was fairly laughing about, primarily a duel for insulting honor where drunk Highlander persistently refuses to die, as well as Kurgan's crazy driving and making faces behind the wheel. I also have to mention the scene of death of Highlander's first wife that, although less and less with every watching because it's poorly done, still shakes me every time and even induce a tear.6/10"

Based on the novels by Rick Riordan, the series puts a spin on the rich mythology by blending it with modern society, which is kind of interesting.The bulk of all the characters here are demigods/half-bloods (offspring of gods and humans). But the protagonist is Percy Jackson, a demigod son of Poseidon. Previously, he along with his besties Annabeth (daughter of Athena) and Grover (a satyr), stopped Luke, the Lightning thief, from destroying Olympus. Here, Camp Half-Blood (demigods' safe haven) are under threat after Thalia's tree, the boundary that protects the camp, is poisoned. The only thing that can heal it is the Golden Fleece which is located on an island in the Sea of Monsters, or what we like to call the Bermuda Triangle. The movie is quite action-packed and pits our hero against a variety of Greek monsters. I loved the scene where the half-bloods had to face the Colchis bull. The mechanical bull was quite extraordinary and that scene was entertaining. However, I felt that the climax was a bit of a letdown as all the tension that had been generated zipped away so quickly. Characters come and go. In ""Sea of Monsters"", much of the ensemble cast that make up the deities from the previous film are absent. We will see no more of Zeus (Sean Bean), Poseidon (Kevin McKidd), Hades (Steve Coogan), Persephone (Rosario Dawson), and Chiron (Pierce Brosnan). That means most of the experienced actors are out (not to forget Uma Thurman as Medusa). In replacement, we get Dionysus portrayed by the reliable Stanley Tucci. The gods Hermes and Chiron have replacements (Nathan Fillion and Anthony Head, respectively). We also have the clumsy but humble Tyson (Douglas Smith), Percy's cyclops half-brother, and the self-eccentric Clarisse La Rue (Leven Rambin), demigod daughter of Ares. The movie had lots of scenes involving special effects. It was okay but it wasn't excellent. Some of the creatures were stunning (the hippocampus was amazing and eye-candy) whereas some looked pretty cheap and effortless (Kronos). Under the direction of a new director, the movie is more faithful to the source compared to the first movie's similarity to the book (although by a tiny bit). But that's not to say some of the scenes diverge from he book. The movie is quite well-paced and during the ride, there are plenty of laughs to enjoy. Overall, ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" is quite an enjoyable film. It's not better than the first and it's not worse than the first. It has quite an interesting premise and some fine action sequences. Rating: 6/10Final Verdict: ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" is a decent sequel that provides plenty of action scenes and laughs, with passable acting and okay visual effects."

However Percy Jackson, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson decide to follow an ancient prophecy and they go to the dangerous journey to the Sea of Monsters to recover the Golden Fleece from Luke that wants to revive the evil Kronos to destroy the Olympus. ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" is a reasonable infantile adventure of the demigod son of Poseidon Percy Jackson. The beautiful Clarisse is an unpleasant character and Percy Jackson is a weak hero; Tyson is too dumb and Grover is funny but coward. Therefore the only attractive character is Annabeth, gorgeous and strong. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Percy Jackson e o Mar de Monstros"" (""Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters"")"
tt1854564,6.0,"Heavy spoiler ahead. I'm not a professional movie or literature critic. I don't really think in the abstract of ""character development"" or other cinematic terms of art. But I know that for me there was something essential missing in this movie. To hit the high points - all the characters including Percy are well if somewhat superficially played, with the exception of course of Tucci, a perfect cast for Dionysus who seems to have found a niche in recent fantasy/sci-fi films. The special effects are pretty good, closer to overwhelming/unbelievable than necessary but better than say Transformers. And the story doesn't drag, it moves around enough to keep you semi-interested. The problem is, I never get fully involved, for two reasons: 1) I don't understand why the characters do what they do; and 2) some of what happens just doesn't make sense (neither of which were as big a problem in the first movie, which was engaging and one or two notches above this). I'll give you one example of each. 1) I missed who Annabeth's mom was (Athena), please remind me of who Athena was and how that would impact on her behavior. Hermes says he made mistakes raising Luke - like what? Tell me something about that. The satyr - what makes him unique and how does that affect his behavior? The movie is more like this happens, then that happens, and this guy is this way and that guy is that way, then this happens, and then this happens. Tryon seems more connected to Poseidon then Percy - give me a hint why. I'm having trouble articulating this but much of what happens seems artificial and arbitrary. There's also not a lot of humor in this movie, which I think is somehow connected to point 1). Percy's lack of connection with his dad is a great great opportunity - use it! (without beating it to death) At the end of the movie, close by having Percy and Tyson go the lake, commiserate about how hard it is to feel connected to dad, and then have a bubble or something come up from the middle of the lake. How could they miss that?!? One example for point 2 - Percy pretty much single-handedly defeats the Bull - how can everyone else not know about that? How can they not congratulate him? Why would Clarisse still say he's a loser? He saved the whole group! I don't know, but it seems like there's a much better way of working with the great basic premise of the Percy Jackson franchise than this."

tt1854564,5.0,"There was not much improvement since the first one. Mr. D did fine, but Clarisse wasn't much like the book. 
1- Myth was messed up on how Kronos. 
2- The Propercy was screwed up. The curse blade was Riptide. The age was 20. 
3- few happened the opposite of what happened in the book. 
4- some were ridiculous. For instance, it took Percy five years to beat Kronos. It took him five minutes in the movie. So powerful Titans, huh. This is going to be to make the third one. The ending and Thalia's story were the only things right."
tt1854564,5.0,"Personally, I kind of enjoyed the first Percy Jackson movie. The tone pretty much reminiscent the eighties/nineties blockbuster, and then the likes of the big stars and the adventurous feel. Admittedly, it's still uninspired in the way it tells its story. The books, I bet, are obviously better, despite of not reading them yet. Now they continued the story in the big screen with Sea of Monsters. It's now in a whole new direction, the biggest difference is it added a lot of CGI and elevates the scale which may forget the uninspired vision of the first one, but those wonderful visuals hardly improves anything at all. The storytelling still relies on over explaining every detail the audience should know. There isn't much new about this sequel except its colors, but even all that are not enough to get this series any better.The sequel easily forgets a lot of the first film's flavor and tries to make a new one. The film is now more interested in presenting the extraordinary elements of this fantastical world, inviting us to something bigger than what we could imagine, since this is what fantasy movies usually need. But further more, it suffers in storytelling. It is once again has the characters explaining stuff throughout their adventure, even the lessons they have to learn are suddenly burst out in the third act. I think that is what they normally do, which forgets to actually develop them. The overall journey is not really that compelling. It's just going one spectacular looking place to another, giving away facts to the heroes then proceed. It feels too easy for these demigods to walk along even at the most seemingly difficult situations.Well, at least they tend to make the aesthetics look a bit better. They can still be generic, but in an eye candy way. These special effects really did a great job covering the laziness of depicting the plot, it's not much of a merit, but it's a sneaky trick the filmmakers have made. Also in the action scenes, it makes the audience think that a certain sequence is thrilling, which is actually not. The monsters are just large and scary, but there isn't enough suspense provided. The best thing I could say in this other than the visuals are the performances. The acting remains, but they are one of the charms left to keep this from being boring.Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is best at glossing things up. The effects made the film look adventurous although it's actually unexciting, and the stars' enthusiasm sort of helped these characters having some personalities than only yelling out information of the plot. In that case, the film can be mildly entertaining, but also forgettable. It's hard to say it's a completely bad film since it had some solid moments. It's a typical modern blockbuster where you will have to praise its technical achievements, performances, and nothing else. The only improvement we might've seen here is the visuals, though I hope everyone would realize that real magic is more than large scale and flashier CGI."
tt10275534,6.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. Argentinian writer-director Damian Szifron was behind the terrific WILD TALES (2014), which received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, and this time out, he and co-writer Jonathan Wakeham venture into psychological crime procedural territory. A captivating opening sequence, expert photography, and top notch acting from the two leads keeps us watching, although there seems to have been some confusion on the best path for the script. The end result is watchable, but not memorable.It is New Year's Eve in Baltimore and celebrations, revelry, and parties are occurring all over the city. As beat cop Eleanor Falco (Shailene Woodley, THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, 2014) negotiates a mundane rift between an irritated diner owner and a slow-eating customer, shots begin to ring out. This frantic sequence captures the panic as we witness a few of the 29 gun shots that find a target. Officer Falco races a couple of blocks to the high-rise building where an explosion occurs. It turns out the sniper destroyed his own lair in order to avoid leaving evidence.Enter renowned FBI Agent Lammark (Ben Mendelsohn, ANIMAL KINGDOM, 2010) who takes charge of the investigation. This point is mentioned because the chain-of-command plays a vital role in the proceedings ... Lammark wants to run the investigation, but bureaucrats and politicians interfere. Lammark hones in on Falco and her instincts. Of course, she has a checkered past that includes having her FBI application denied. Here she acts as a liaison and provides insight into the killer. Get it? One damaged person can relate to another.Some social commentary gets periodically interjected - gun control, power plays by law enforcement, misplaced priorities by politicians - but the fun part is watching Mendelsohn and Woodley flash their respective talent. She's kind of a flawed Clarice Starling and he's a guy that is committed to finding the bad guy. Filmed in Montreal, cinematographer Javier Julia maintains a cool atmosphere throughout, and Carter Burwell's music delivers some excellent piano parts. This ends up being one of those movies that's enough fun to watch if you don't think too hard while it's playing, and it also reminds us that Ben Mendelsohn and Shailene Woodley are fine actors who deliver in every role.Opens in theaters on April 21, 2023."
tt10275534,5.0,"This starts with a great set up. A well prepared, motivated serial killer kills 29 and gets away with it in a fabulous opening.The second act is all cat and mouse with a great set piece at a shopping mall.After that it becomes terribly formulaic. White supremicists targeted and taken down by a strong female character with addiction issues, the obligatory black police officer and a female black officer who dues exs into the the scene.After that it's the slippery slope of gay cop who is dying, killer who is not as well prepared or skilled as he has shown all movie, strong woman who takes him down and then inexplicably extorts the situation for her gain at the end.All in all, a terrible disappointment."
tt10275534,6.0,"With its two fine stars and gripping opening scenes ""To Catch A Killer"" shoulda / coulda been a top-class cop / psycho thriller, but co-writer (with Jonathan Wakeham) / director Damián Szifron plods, stumbles & loses his way - to deliver something way more ordinary. When an ace sniper kills 20+ folk one Baltimore NYE, under fire senior FBI agent Ben Mendelsohn and keen, astute (but troubled) beat cop Shailene Woodley team up to figure him out & hunt him down - though bureaucratic nincompoops, elusive witnesses and false leads slow them up. Support from the likes of Ralph Ineson & Jovan Adepo couldn't save this one from its own hum-drum mediocrity."
tt27145269,5.0,"I was a big fan of the original series, so, I was glad to see when this came out, but to me it was poorly written compared to most of the originals. My biggest complaint is the murder method was obvious at 32 minutes in. Second, the Monk type OCD scenes were played too long and just became tedious, slowing the plot. Third, Monk's death scene was absurd. You would think for an actual movie, they would have devised a much more intricate plot, especially considering the obvious cost and bring 2 actors out of retirement to reprise their roles. At the end it is a bit less interesting than the average Monk series episode, still enjoyable, like watching a lost episode or an alternate series finale. Maybe they'll reprise the series with better writers."
tt27145269,5.0,"Adrian Monk's long-awaited return sputters in ""Mr. Monk's Last Case,"" a movie that feels like a reheated episode of its origin show. The surrounding performances are bland, the plot predictable, and the atmosphere surprisingly sterile. The mystery itself is lacking the intricate twists and turns that once kept viewers glued. Monk's signature deductions feel phoned-in, and the supporting characters, including a thinly veiled Jeff Bezos parody, fail to spark any interest. Jokes fall flat, and the pacing plods along like a forgotten Tuesday night rerun.Visually, the film lacks the grit and charm of the original series, opting for a bland, made-for-TV aesthetic. While die-hard fans might find a shred of nostalgia in Shalhoub's iconic portrayal, ""Mr. Monk's Last Case"" ultimately feels like a missed opportunity. It's a pale shadow of its former self, leaving viewers yearning for the days when Monk's neuroses were genuinely thrilling, not just tired tropes.Overall, this was a disappointing reunion that fails to recapture the magic of the original series. Watch only if you're desperate for a Monk fix, and be prepared for a case of deja vu.Rating: 5-/10 (bellow average, not recommended)"
tt27145269,5.0,"The good: Tony Shalhoub's acting performance is great. As ever I must say, because this actor has got a special talent for playing characters who are masterful at fumbling things up, making a fool out of themselves, in such an endearing way that I can only sympathize with his characters. And this movie aint no different, although it looks and feels more like a television pilot than a real movie, which brings me to the bad...The bad: this movies' other actors are quite mediocre. And unfortunately they do get a lot of screentime and dialogue. It almost seems as if Tony Shalhoub got all the great lines and the other characters got only ""filler"" dialogue. The scenes with Tony Shalhoub were a delight to watch, but the many other scenes kinda bored me to be honest.Not terrible for certain, but not great either. It'll do as a nice pastime for those who are into slowburing, quirky, gentle detective stories.The story: Tony Shalhoub plays a neurotic detective, who visits his shrink frequently and who has got many kinds of fears. Despite all these hilariously looking shortcomings and witty scenes about his anxious outlook on his personal life he simultaneously has to solve a complex murder case. Will he succeed or run back to his shrink asking for more pills and understanding?"
tt27145269,6.0,"Adrian Monk returns with even more OCD than he had when the regular show started back in 2002.Having had a difficult time during the Covid pandemic.

Monk is upset that he would not be able to pay for Molly, his stepdaughter's wedding.However it never goes that far. Her fiancé, Griffin an investigative journalist is killed in a bungee jumping accident.Only Molly thinks it is murder. He had ruffled the feathers of tech billionaire Rick Eden (James Purefoy) who is preparing to go into space. Griffin implied that he might have killed his business partner.The movie serves as a backdoor pilot. It is just a shame that it is not a good story. Eden is a thinly disguised Bezos rip off but a murdering one.Monk comes across as irritating rather than a brilliant detective with OCD issues."
tt1478338,5.0,"At times ridiculously funny, but other times severally frustrating, Bridesmaids suffers most from trying to do to many things at once. In my experience watching this film, I had truly never seen a comedy that confused my emotions so much like this one. It's as if 2 people took turns writing every other scene and put it all together into one mesh of a film. At times, Bridesmaids can be a brilliant dramedy, providing some very sweet and touching moments, and some truly outrageously funny gags. At other times, the film can be extremely painful to watch, whether it's from the awkward funny gags, cliched writing, or it trying to force it all at once, the film can't ever seem to truly find its footing. However, in the grand scheme of things, I would say there is more positive than negative in the film, and though there was certainly many steps in making it, Bridesmaids at times can be a pretty good film. As for the acting, Melissa McCarthy steals the show in every scene she takes a part of, truly deserving the best supporting actress nomination at the actors, and showing how to write a character as eccentric as herself. Other good performances include Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd, and at times Kristen Wiig. In the end, Bridesmaids is a bit of a mixed bag. Its tonal shifts are unappreciated, and its humor, when it isn't trying too hard, can be brilliant. It may be confusing to the senses to sit all the way through, but there are plenty of good gags to bring you to the end of the film, even if the journey makes you frustrated as Wiig's character throughout.My Rating: 5/10."
tt1478338,5.0,"There should be a film classification which restricts admission to people UNDER a certain age. In the case of Bridesmaids it should be restricted to under fifteens. That's about the level of humour of this film. Despite the good reviews it's actually a pile of inane, predictable, juvenile rubbish.I really wanted to like it, but it was just embarrassing. I felt no sympathy at all for any of the characters. If I enjoyed slapstick and gutter humour I might have liked it better. Every ""joke"" was stretched out beyond its limits. Overall, a painful experience.This is a final line of text to get past IMDb's silly restriction on too-short reviews. Bridesmaids is still rubbish."

Ther is absolutely no tension or suspense.
The film does have some good one liners, the yellow spandex suit is hilarious, the Christmas tree guy is a big lol but watch out for those 80s dresses n moustaches inspite of the film set in 2019.Check out for Lin Shaye as the propaganda officer and Franco Columbu as the 911 Security Officer #2."
tt0093894,6.0,"Released just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was achieving megastar status, this film about stardom is a wry pun on his career and the media business around him. Films like these are not meant to be analysed, they are meant to be enjoyed, and THE RUNNING MAN certainly manages to do that.After a shaky start involving the worst title sequence in the history of cinema (although it's good to see the Sinclair Spectrum finally get global use!), director Paul Michael Glaser presents an eye-popping glimpse at the television of tomorrow. This witty slice of sociological irony would have admittedly been slicker in the hands of regular Paul Verhoeven, but Glaser keeps the action flowing throughout, and presents us with some bizarrely fascinating villains as well as the usual action frolics. One query, though, is over the level of violence. Oddly enough there doesn't really seem to be enough. In a program where the broad concept is horrifically barbaric, Glaser seems reluctant to horrify us beyond the disappointing ""see the blood spattering from the violence that's just off camera"" and those awful rubber corpses! I do not wish to appear to be encouraging unnecessary violence, but in a comic-book film where 'gore is its core', not including it almost makes you feel that it is trying to take itself too seriously, and therefore makes it even more horrific. Perhaps this delicate subject is better explained by Paul Verhoeven in his excellent commentary to ROBOCOP (DVD Criterion Collection).But the performances in THE RUNNING MAN are suitably solid, from the powerful Schwarzenegger to the sleazy game show host. Any fan of the 80s action genre will love this, so sit back and prepare for SHOWTIME!!!!!!"

tt9100018,6.0,"""Cobweb"" is a slow-burning thriller that builds tension from ordinary events to eerie happenings, culminating in a series of abnormal occurrences. The director skillfully develops the characters' backstories, and the leading actors deliver convincing performances, particularly in their portrayal of semi-psychopathic characters. The story is engaging and keeps the audience captivated without resorting to cheap tricks.However, the film's ending falls short of expectations. In an attempt to create a frightening atmosphere, the final scene is shot in near darkness, making it difficult to discern what is happening on screen. Rather than being scary, this lack of visibility is frustrating and detracts from the overall impact of the film, which is a shame because otherwise this could have been an outstanding film.Overall, ""Cobweb"" earns an exact score of 58 / 100 from me. Fans of the genre may find it worth watching, but others may want to give it a miss."
tt9100018,5.0,"Not a huge fan of this movie because of the massive pivot half way thru.I won't spoil it but there's a point where they build up to something which I was looking forward to, and then the movie just devolves down the proverbial toilet bowl.Some of the audience will enjoy the devolution after build up and then full toilet bowl down to bad writing/cgi and utter nonsense, but I personally wasn't a fan.This is becoming a bit of a trend, where movies will drive you somewhere, but then make a hard turn into chaos, where the writing style and the entire build up was something of a ruse. This movie for me it didn't work, the first half was well
acted and very creepy however. 5.5/10."
tt9100018,6.0,"Director Samuel Bodin's first theatrical feature is atmospheric, and departs from stock slasher conventions just enough to make for an entertaining if unexceptional scarefest. Cobweb feels like an incomplete collection of horror ideas that aren't explored to their full potential, but it fairly succeeds thanks to the second act where the real terror awakens.There's no sugarcoating Cobweb's flaws, from pacing to convoluted editing, and at times with crappy CGI that actually scares more than the movie. It might not be a particularly memorable horror film, but it's still decent enough with it's jump scares that engages us. The climax/conclusion was lousy though, which somehow ended in a jiffy rather than taking it slow.My Rating:6/10."
tt9100018,6.0,"I liked this one! It's not ground-breaking innovative and it has its flaws. It's about two creepy parents living in a creepy house, something creepy is hiding inside the house and a bullied boy with nightmares. It's the perfect setting for a good old-school horror movie. Unfortunately, it's not that creepy but I enjoyed every minute of it, Except for the terrible ending. But you can't get everything can you. There is not much acting going on so I can't really comment on that other than the little boy is doing fine. The parents are supposed to be unsettling and I think they do a desent job. Don't expect people or things will follow basic logic, because it doesn't. Just relax and enjoy the ride for what it is. It is occasionally bloody and gory but not a typical slasher movie - something I appreciated. Cobweb is definitely not a 1 star movie, nor is it a 10 star masterpiece. In my opinion 6/10 is what it deserves."
tt9100018,6.0,"I'm a huge horror fanatic especially these under the radar films. I went into this really not knowing much just the cool looking posters. The movie starts of amazing with great camera work and the main cast was really good (creepy) the star was the child actor and he was the star. I enjoyed what he brought to the film and was very believable. The movie didn't have any straight forward runs, every time you think you have it figured out it gave you a hard left (Barbarian) type style hard turns of the plot. It had me fully intrigued and committed as a horror fan. First half of the movie I couldn't figure it out but yet I thought I had it figured out. Now that last act was the let down. It could of been delivered so much better but it felt rushed and without a set conclusion, no actual closure. It was a tale of 2 half's and the first half was an amazingly done film the last half I don't know what happen, so disappointed but I'll say it's worth a viewing."
tt9100018,5.0,"So at first they're trying to trick you into thinking that the parents are nutjobs. But after they're no longer in the picture, they're showing a completely different story. I have so many questions that went unanswered. Why did the parents kept the monster? Why didn't the monster kill the parents? She certainly strong enough to tear apart 3 semi-grown-up boys plus a handicapped little one. What's the connection between this family and the missing girl from way back then? It's so weird how they went with this direction. It'll be more believable if they just turned the monster into a bogeyman or something similar. Cause trying to think a girl can climb up the walls like spider-man, and slice and dice people like Jason Vorhees is the least believable thing in this world. No matter what you feed her, she can't have super strength and climbing ability. Too bad, cause the horror part was pretty scary and the parents are pretty creepy. I can't give a rating less than 5, cause of the horror vibe was pretty good."
tt9100018,5.0,"It has be bewildered that so much effort was put into the beginning of the movie only to shoot itself in the foot in the second act. What started out as a tense, creepy and mysterious movie ended with some b movie vibe nonsensical creature feature. Dont get me wrong who doesn't like a good creature feature, but this one made no sense at all. It was a big jump in the script that really didn't work out. One minute you're thinking ""is it a ghost, is it a human, hmm"" next minute ""NO its angry deformed telekinetic spider sister"". And if you think that's a big jump you probably won't like the jump from eerie horror to cheesy action movie either."
tt9100018,6.0,"The first hour of Cobweb was properly scary in places, built some great tension and benefited from great acting from Caplan especially. The direction was very effective even though it did rely on jump scares a little to much.So far so good. However, the last twenty minutes or so really stretch the levels of believability to breaking point. The strength of Cobweb is its ambiguous nature at the start. What happened to the girl? Who really are the mum and dad? And who is the voice behind the wall? Are all questions that we really shouldn't have had answers to.Unfortunately it seems that the director to the excellent French spook series on Netflix Mariane has caved to the less esoteric American style of of happy endings with everything and cover it with layers of cheese.Still very watchable though."
tt9100018,6.0,"A pre pre halloween tweezer, gives you a relentless start of the darker nights that follows the fall season, a pretty well orchestrated movie with much sound and screaming, well composed music for the plot, but, and that is a big but...its filmed in a far too dark visuals production, so who hung the lights up, vuff vuff vuff vuff...a decent kick in the bucket for choosing that amount of darkness covering up the plot,act and action at the height of the climax of this horror feature. So if you have night googles,use them, mine didnt work so.Anyway, its a film about sturdy parenting of a bullied child hearing voices in his head, i bet youll know the recepie, just a 6 from the grumpy old man."
tt9100018,6.0,"This movie actually delivered as a horror movie by actually starting off with a creepiness to it and kept that feeling through most of the movie. As with most horror movies, there are moments of ""that was kind of lame"" but it held my attention and I did enjoy the story line and the characters.I was originally going to rate this movie an 8 but the ending left me staring at the screen thinking "" was that really the end."" You know how you feel the movie getting close to the end and are anticipating what will happen? This movie had me right there the whole time but the ending was bad. So bad where I sat there kind of annoyed haha. So I dropped my rating to a 6."
tt0831387,6.0,"Oh, the trailers looked so good. I had hope, and, for the most part, my only criterion was that it be better than Pacific Rim, Hollywood's attempt at the kaiju genre last year. I liked that one, but was disappointed (with Guillermo del Toro, I expected something with a little more meat). Godzilla does not clear that hurdle. It has the same major problem that all these kinds of films do: the human element is lacking. Severely here. And what a fantastic cast to waste! Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe! Every single one of them utterly wasted. Hopefully they all got a big check. We have all these people, but instead we're saddled with charisma black hole Aaron Taylor-Johnson (of Kick-Ass fame), who isn't even adequate. Thankfully, the big monster fights deliver, for the most part. There could maybe be more monster action, but when it's there, it's a lot of fun. I also thank the filmmakers for restraining themselves and keeping the film at only two hours (it runs a tad over that if you stay through the credits)."
tt0831387,6.0,"During the 1950s, creatures are awaken from the deepest depths. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes that ancient creatures exist that lives in radiation. As the radiation faded from the earth's surface, these creatures retreated to the lower depths. In 1999, miners uncover a vast cavern with a giant skeleton in the Philippines. They also find one of the spores broken open. In Japan at the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant, manager Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife in a freak incident. Fifteen years later, Joe is still investigating the incident with the city around the plant quarantined. He is arrested once again for trying to breach the quarantine. His son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has to leave behind his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) in San Francisco to go pick him up from jail in Japan. Joe convinces Ford who is now a US Navy ordnance disposal officer to join him to go to the plant. They discover that there is no radiation leak. Instead the spore from the Philippines named MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) has settled in the plant sucking up all the radiation.This is always going to be a great monster movie. The CGI is terrific and Godzilla has a great time smashing things up. That part seems like a no-brainer. I still give director Gareth Edwards credit for doing a great job. He doesn't disappoint. The problem is once again the human story. The beginning is just too long before it gets to a monster. The Joe Brody story doesn't have the bite. In another movie, his story would be a fun mystery. The problem is that the audience knows it's a monster even if it's not Godzilla. So there is no tension from the mystery since it's not really a mystery. The other problem is that Ford just happens to be at the right place in all of those situations. It's a situation that a lesser movie would rely on. I hoped for better. The final problem I have is that the movie cuts away from the monster action time and time again. It's funny the first time but it gets annoying quickly. Despite all the problems, there is still a fun monster movie and lots of stuff get smashed."
tt0831387,5.0,"Meh. The movie started strong and slowly fizzled out. I liked the emotional pull in the opening act and how the story was set up. Unfortunately, everything that followed was just dull. The over-the-top destruction felt meaningless. Every character apart from Bryan Cranston lacked personality.On top of all my gripes, the film was very dark... physically. I had a hard time seeing what was happening for the majority of the action sequences.Formulaic and lackluster, I hope that Kong kicks Godzilla's spiny tail.Best Character: Joe Brody

tt10172266,6.0,"Cramming the content of a novel into a two-hour movie means you're going to see characters eliminated and scenes combined, that's just a given. To say ""the book was better"" is a well-worn cliche, so I won't use it here, but having read the book first, I was saddled with expectations that were never met.For a light, two-hour ""Hallmark movie the week"" style flick? Red, White & Royal Blue was fine. But the cost was having to eliminate most of the emotion, peril and building up to the big scenes that the book had. The pacing felt rushed, and it seemed like the director was trying to get to from one big moment from the book to the next, as quickly as possible before they ran out of time.Casting-wise, the actors all pretty much looked exactly like how they were meticulously described in the book-with one glaring exception. In the book, Alex was much younger. Closer to 21. He was also noticeably shorter than Henry too, at around 5' 7"" or 5' 8"" (which is why his ""He doesn't look 6' 2""!"" line in the film seems to come out of nowhere). Nicholas Galitzine was a decade to old and far too tall for the part. Instead of seeing a young college student fall for a tall, handsome prince? We spent two hours watching two grown Abercrombie & Fitch models trying to ""out hot"" each other.Overall the film was cute and worked fine, but it lacked most of the emotion and actual peril the book rewarded us with-and what a 3 to 5-episode mini-series could've delivered."

It's a Greg Berlanti production and I've been impressed with his films and TV series.I wasn't impressed with the script or the casting. Berger and Aptaker who wrote ""Love, Simon"" and ""Love, Victor"" or John Butler who wrote and directed ""Handsome Devil"" would have written a better script IMHO and I wish Greg Berlanti or John Butler directed it. Galitzine and Perez are both very handsome young men, but too old for the parts. In the book Henry is a year out of Oxford and Alex is a senior at Georgetown, so they'd be in their early 20s. I've seen Galitzine in other films: ""The Beat Beneath My Feet"", ""Handsome Devil"", ""Purple Hearts"", ""Cinderella""...he's an experienced young actor. While I saw Perez in ""The Kissing Booth 2 & 3"" and ""Minx"". I like both of them as actors. Sarah Shahi and Rachel Hilson have some great lines.I didn't care for Uma Thurman in this role, part was her acting and her accent and part was the direction. A lot of it looked like it was filmed on a sound stage with green screen, the tiny Oval Office and the fake balcony of the White House. Some scenes looked more like they belonged on a theater stage than in a movie, the film director was a stage director. Most of the book takes place in the US, don't know why it was filmed in the UK.Some scenes worked very well, some scenes not so well and some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. The scene when Alex is in his rooms at Kensington Palace having arrived to do damage control and Henry walks in looking for Cornetto's, it got cut but we got part of it in a teaser trailer. That's a scene that should have been kept and Alex's campaigning in Texas could have been cut back.Rather than a 2 hour film with a lot missing from the book, a mini series of two or three 90 minute episodes would have worked much better. It's not the quality that I expected. I highly doubt this will ever be remade, so this was it."
tt10172266,5.0,"With the usual forced hipness of an Amazon Prime original movie... where everyone's on the same level of pop culture glibness... Red, White and Royal Blue plays it too safe with the inevitable romance between a female president's son (who grew up ""working class"" before his mom became the leader of the free world, somehow) and the classy, born-rich prince of England...Being a rom-com, both are supposed to be polar opposites, and yet they're not different enough to comically clash before inevitably connecting: the prince is snobby and antisocial yet he's also cool and affable, while the President's son is socially confident yet is also geeky and vulnerable...And while there's an attempt to make their initial anti-bonding work by a rudimentary viral moment involving a large cake... it's extremely contrived, seeming out of a sitcom rather than a genuine movie...The two male leads should have been fleshed out separately and equally: we kind of know the American son yet don't really know the prince at all...And since the surrounding side-characters are so progressively cautious and broadly modern-thinking (aka politically-correct), there's no edge to the couple's controversial union (which is the story's primary twist) to make any kind of decent comedy from it, romantic or otherwise."
tt0364725,6.0,"What's funny about dodgeball? First, it's a movie about a group of non-competitive and somewhat eccentric adults playing dodgeball to save a not-very-impressive gym from the clutches of a competitive monopolistic chain gym. Second - Ben Stiller. Stiller is over-the-top and hilarious as the evil nemesis of average Joe Vince Vaughn. Vaughn - playing the slightly less than average Joe owner of Average Joe's gym, plays the perennial hard luck loser to the hilt. The supporting cast is terrific. Alan Tudyk, Rip Torn, Christine Taylor and Stephen Root are a great ensemble.This is a rather extreme and rather Hollywood camp comedy. Although a lot of the humor is adult, the film is also refreshingly clean compared with the averaged 21st century comedy. Dodgeball also doubles as a spot-the-cameo film, since a whole host of odd celebrities pop up here and there throughout.The first time I saw this film, I was charmed and I laughed a lot. Although the film remained entertaining, like most comedies it lost a bit of its luster in its second viewing.Why only a 6 rating? Despite the campiness and good solid humor, this is still a very formulaic film and it does tend to vaporize after a viewing or two.Strongly recommended - for one viewing!"
tt0364725,6.0,"Well, here is yet another sleazy PG-13 modern-day comedy that also has genuinely funny characters and scenes. For those of us who care it's a shame we have have to put up with the bad stuff if you want laughs out of about any comedy made in the last 30 years....and this is a prime example. By the way, this is an ""R"" all the way, if any concerned parents are reading this. You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really, really stupid. Both of those are typical, too. Yet, most of my friends said this was hilarious and to check the film out. Prior to the typically-dumb ending are some very funny moments, mostly provided by Ben Stiller's over-the-top fitness guru, ""White Goodman,"" a man who runs an ultra high-tech fitness center. Vince Vaughan plays the likable good guy small-gym owner who is in competition with Stiller, sort of like David against Goliath, the nerds against the jocks.....another formula that is so often used these days in comedies because it's always fun to see the little guy knock off the arrogant big jerk. Christine Taylor is the token young ""hottie"" that you also see in these kind of pictures: skinny, pretty, but not exactly the wholesome type.Rip Torn almost steals the show as ""Patches O'Houlihan,"" the old man who helps coach the underdog volleyball team using some unorthodox methods. I laugh every time I think of him. In fact, ""Patches"" puts the added edge in this film to elevate it slightly above a ""fair"" rating.A lot of the humor in here is the improbableness of the whole story. Of course, it's an insult to anyone's intelligence but that's part of the charm and one does get a decent amount of laughs for an hour-and-half, so it's not all bad."
tt0364725,6.0,"Dodgeball is one of those comedies that does a perfectly decent job of entertaining you but is unlikely to blow you away.There are some good characters with a very solid cast. Ben Stiller always puts in a shift, particularly when he has an outrageous oddball character play like he does here. Vince Vaughn is always watchable if rarely amazing. Christine Taylor was a great addition to the castThe plot is nice and lighthearted and fun, although it does have some totally unnecessary tangents (a pointless teen romance and an unfunny pirate being the main two). Despite never being overly funny it is entertaining, with an entirely predictable story that is pretty safe. Although it is a tad dated in parts.This is one of many comedies from the early noughties era that I'm glad are out there, because they always have a great cast and a distinctive comedy style that has a certain charm, but they rarely blow me away. A fun watch but nothing more."
tt0364725,6.0,The presence of Ben Stiller usually promises fun and this crude and raucous but brightly coloured and basically good-natured cross between 'Rollerball' and 'Slap Shot' combines digs at the American need to win at all costs with a few nice ideas; such as the cute punch line given leading lady Christine Taylor.
tt0364725,6.0,"""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" provides just enough good-natured low brow humor to make up for the fact that the film is not always as funny as it intends to be.Vince Vaughn takes on the role of straight man as Peter La Fleur, the owner of a third rate gym called ""Average Joe's"" that caters to the.umhow shall we say it? less athletically inclined, less single-mindedly health-conscious consumer. Pete's patrons are all ""losers"" and social outcasts who find Average Joe's the one place where they can find camaraderie and be accepted for who they really are. The problem is that, through poor business management, Peter has virtually bankrupted the establishment to the tune of $50,000 that needs to be paid off pronto if he is to maintain ownership of the place. Enter White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the self-made, egomaniacal owner of a top-of-the-line gym across the street who is determined to force Peter out of business and make it part of his own franchise. To raise the money, Pete and his comrades form a ragtag dodge ball team and head to Las Vegas to compete in the national championships. When Goodman gets wind of the plan, he forms his own team to take on Average Joe's less-than-average players in a David and Goliath showdown broadcast on nationwide TV.Most of the humor in ""Dodgeball"" is of the Three Stooges/hit-one-another-in-the-groin variety that works pretty well for the most part, even if it does tend to become a bit strained and repetitious after awhile. Vaughn and Stiller have a fun time playing off one another, with the former carefully low balling his performance while the latter bursts forth in a no-holds-barred display of manic energy. Christine Taylor is also lovely and fine as the bank accountant who starts off rummaging through Peter's financial records and winds up as a star player on his team. The other cast members are all entertaining as well, and the film features a host of effective cameo performances from the likes of William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Jason Bateman, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong who really makes a mark in his short, but pivotal and well written scene near the end of the film. But the real acting honors go to Rip Torn as a crazy, wheelchair-bound coach who uses some mighty unorthodox methods to whip the boys into shape. Torn is the undisputed comic force at the center of the film."

There wasn't a moment in it I was bored and I was very invested in the story. Completely agree it is very Hitchcock and simple and serious in its execution. You could also really feel her isolation and loneliness which contributed to the anxiety and ""chilled"" feeling I got while watching it (if that makes sense). I saw it in the theater and really loved it. One of the best horror films in recent memory for me. Most of the time, I watched your reviews first before watching the movie, so I was very intrigued by this film. I also gave it 7/10 because I felt this movie is missing something remarkable in order to give it a perfect score. I love Jules' character. She tries to survive to that sociopath by her own which is admirable because she was alone. I hate her husband, so selfish thinking about himself and his work. He didn't care about his wife at all pretending she was imaging everything. The watcher obviously is frustrated with his life. He has to take care about his old father which is something that bothers him a lot.

Bud is traditional but Sissy is independent. Bud likes to ride the mechanical bull at Gilley's. Released convict and rodeo bullrider Wes Hightower (Scott Glenn) impresses Sissy with his skills. He teaches her after Bud forbids her to ride.It's hard to like Bud especially at the beginning. It takes awhile for him to build some vulnerability. I never really get to a point where I'm rooting for this couple to stay together. It's the first leading role for Debra Winger and she shows her great feistiness as well as vulnerability. Gilley's is very well represented. That cowboy way is nicely done. It would be great for this movie to be shorter and for Bud to not be so much of a jerk. It would allow for better rooting interest. I don't particularly care who wins or who gets together by the end. Although I definitely want Sissy to get out of her troubled life.
tt0081696,6.0,"There's a part of me that wishes I was cognizant in 1980 when the ""Urban Cowboy"" craze hit; just to experience the hype if nothing else (I saw it in utero, but that doesn't count). As it stands, this is best viewed as a cultural curiosity; a snapshot both of Travolta in his prime and the Western craze. It's that star power that helps the film retain its potency for decades after the fact. The camera belabors that point with the shot of its lead actor posing against the bar, beer in hand, intensity smoldering (they even used that on the poster to sell tickets).If we're talking substance, hell there's not much. The allure of bull-riding is lost on me and the men in this movie are absolute pigs. Watching Debra Winger go from one loveless abuser to another is a real drag, and she tends to be the film's sympathetic core.I can't blame anyone for not being able to relate to this movie if their first watch is in 2020, but I can appreciate the mark it made in its time."

Scott Glenn plays his rival while Barry Corbin & Brooke Alderson appear as his amiable uncle and aunt.It's overlong by at least 20 minutes and the alcohol-obsession & bed-hopping shenanigans get tedious, but I like the docudrama style. The film takes its time and successfully puts you in the C&W subculture. The plot's predictable, showing the best & worst in human behavior, yet leaves you with a good feeling. There's a likable simplicity and honesty to the people, despite their less savory sides (i.e. the alcohol/cigs & bed-hopping). The movie scores well on the female front, mostly of the tight jeans & t-shirt variety (naturally), fronted by Winger with her girl-next-door cuteness and followed by Smith with her drop-dead-gorgeous ambiance. Connie Hanson appears as the striking redhead. The final act features the Charlie Daniels Band and you can't go wrong with them.THE MOVIE RUNS 132 minutes and was shot in the Houston area of Texas (Dear Park, Pasadena & Huntsville) and Pico Rivera, California (Mobile home park).

Then one night the management of the nightclub puts in a mechanical bull and their lives are changed forever. Now if this plot sounds a bit corny that's because it really is. But it manages to capture the flavor of that particular area during that particular time due in large part because of the country music which was so popular back then. No doubt, there are probably plenty of viewers who won't care for this film as it is clearly dated to a specific time in America--and I fully understand that. Be that as it may, it brought back some good memories and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

tt1840309,5.0,"In a post-apocalyptic dystopia, the world is destroyed and only Chicago has survived with a society divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). The teenager Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) belongs to the Abnegation that rules the society but she fells outcast and attracted by the Dauntless. When she is sixteen years old, she is submitted to an aptitude test to indicate in which faction she will stay for the rest of her life, but she learns that she has aptitude to be in the Abnegation, Erudite and Dauntless. Further, she learns that she is a Divergent that is destroyed by the government. On the next day, she chooses to join the Dauntless where she changes her name to Tris and is trained by Four (Theo James). They fall in love with each other and soon Tris discovers that the Erudite are planning to take over the power from the Abnegation and become the ruling faction. ""Divergent"" is an adventure movie with a dull and lame story based in a stupid and senseless concept of society. The dystopia does not make any sense and everything is idiotic in the story: the society, the plot, the romance, the way the Dauntless jump from the train, the conclusion. If there is a faction formed for the most intelligent people, it seems to be obvious that they should rule this chaotic society. Tris kills many soldiers but she leaves Jeanine alive in the end. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Divergente"" (""Divergent"")"
tt1840309,5.0,"When reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate to film. It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best."
tt1840309,5.0,"I went to see this movie misled by the high rating on IMDb. Unfortunately it looks like Hollywood makes movies for people with short memory. I admit I haven't read the source book, but I guess I wouldn't, judging by what came out of it. I hereby venture myself in saying that the book is also a bad SciFi novel. It has way to obvious imports from well known themes that have been exploited to the brim by today (like the ""perfect"" society that sacrifices diversity for peace, the ""different"" guy that stands-up to the system, the genuine technology that controls individuals (poorly described, by the way), the fear confrontation ad the list could go on and on. It is not essentially bad to bring these themes in a movie, but I see nothing new, original here. So... if you have seen Equilibrum and the Hunger Games then you know it all. Movies today are just mobile phones... keep reproducing ""features"" from the competition, while it is supposed to be an art. Another thing can't stand in movies in general is the poor IT incursions. I am talking about the scene in which Jeanine is asked to turn off the ""control system"" which consists of a huge touch screen in which she just hits some ""cancel"" button. That was really pathetic... Anyone could have done that right? Another thing that I can't stand, is the cheap psychology things in these movies. They are all based on some sort of psychoanalysis which is long time deprecated in therapy. But it is somehow considered to be ""cool"" and ""trendy"" by producers to insert these kind of flavour into the movies to make it more profound. Or are they just as stupid and ignorants as the target viewers? Anyhow... to me, this is bad taste in art. If you want to really go for it, you must do way better that that and if you can't, then at least make it more interesting. It is also true that movies like ""Inception"" don't occur every month, but once they do... they set a trend and everybody will just take a byte of it. Don't get me wrong, it is a ""watchable"" movie, perhaps a little too long for its story, which, by the way, is very predictable and full of clichés. I read some users claiming it resembles ""The Hunger Games"" and so it is, especially with the modest ending that awkwardly announces a sequel. I could predict how the story developed and ended after the first 15 minutes and that's what makes this movie mediocre. Script is mediocre, but at least it does not abounds in stereotypes so it's bearable. What can be said about acting... there is no acting in this kind of movies, you only need to be young and good looking, be able to learn your part and you're done. It's not that the actors are bad, but the movie itself is not based on any acting mastery and just because of that, the girl gets a plus for making something out of it. I am curious if the ratings will stay as high as now in time."
tt1840309,6.0,"When beloved books make their way to the silver screen, the resulting movies are usually met with much frustration and rending of clothes from amongst the literary faithful. A character is changed beyond recognition; a crucial plot-point excised; an important theme lost in the murk and swell of a film. Oddly, Divergent isn't actually a bad adaptation. In fact, Neil Burger's film is as good a version of Veronica Roth's wildly patchy source novel as you're likely to get. Whether that makes for a good movie - especially for people who've never read the book - is another matter entirely.Divergent begins in a post-apocalyptic Chicago divided into five factions, each valuing one virtue - Dauntless (courage), Erudite (wisdom), Candour (honesty), Amity (kindness), and Abnegation (self-sacrifice) - above all others. It's an odd system, perhaps, but one that is apparently necessary to keep chaos at bay. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) has been raised in Abnegation but, try as she might, she cannot completely subsume her self or her desires. Indeed, the aptitude test that everyone must take at the age of sixteen suggests that Tris doesn't belong in just one category: she is Divergent, equally at home in three factions.Come the day of the Choosing Ceremony, she decides to forsake her family to become Dauntless: a decision that plunges her into a nightmare initiation process in which the weakest are summarily kicked out of the faction. As Tris navigates the politics and perils of her chosen world, trying all the while to hide the fact that she's Divergent, she encounters her fair share of allies - Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Will (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) and possibly her charmingly broody instructor Four (Theo James) - and enemies, including the brutal Eric (Jai Courtney) and vicious Peter (Miles Teller).Anyone unfamiliar with Roth's book might find themselves trying to puzzle through this seemingly shapeless mess of a plot. It ebbs and flows in odd directions, dancing around Tris' desire to be true to herself, before it gets a little lost in the dystopian clutches of Jeanine Matthews (a gleefully icy, evil Kate Winslet), an Erudite leader hellbent on bringing down the entire Abnegation faction. Along the way, Tris literally battles her fears under the influence of a simulation serum, toughens up physically, strikes up a sexy chemistry with Four and frets over her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort). Within the confines of this universe, it makes an odd kind of narrative sense, but the logic of it all never really bleeds through.Here's the thing, though: this strange, frequently illogical plotting is very much a defining characteristic of Roth's novel - and, in fact, becomes more of a problem as the trilogy progresses. (Anyone who's read Allegiant, the controversial final novel in the series, will know just how difficult it will be to adapt.) The emotional and logical flaws present in Divergent the film, then, are - for the most part - already inherent in the book. Why does Jeanine, supposedly one of the smartest people in the community, plot and plan the way she does? How does the entire society function in this utterly dysfunctional way? Technically, Burger can't really be faulted for failing to develop a coherence and logic that was never there in the first place.In fact, Burger actually substantially improves upon the novel in several ways - he keeps the film mostly free of Tris' inner voice, which becomes increasingly moony and silly as her crush on Four grows by the day. Burger plays up a zip-line sequence that highlights the joyful recklessness of the Dauntless, as Tris soars freely through the midnight air. He also handles the problem of Tris' fear landscape very well: instead of simply willing herself out of the influence of the serum (as the Divergent can do), she must figure out how to face each of her fears in a non-Divergent way. These scenes are shot with quick, simple visual flair, dispensing with some of the novel's trickier convolutions.Of course, Divergent isn't a perfect adaptation either. To Roth's credit, there are some truly dark, painful moments in the novel which transcend its loopy narrative. It's no surprise, and yet it's a little disappointing, that these bits simply vanish from the film, no doubt in the interests of securing a PG-13 rating. As a result, Peter is a far less repulsive antagonist than he is on paper. For instance, he doesn't brutally (and casually) maul a fellow initiate who's doing better than him in the rankings - an incident that's crucial in the development of his character in the subsequent novels.The young cast works hard and quite well together. Woodley makes for an intriguing screen presence, effectively playing both the steel and softness of Tris' choices. James, heretofore best known for dying in Lady Mary's bed in Downton Abbey, acquits himself reasonably well - he's not as leaden as some of the trailers have suggested, and he forges a believable chemistry with Woodley. Of the supporting players, Teller is the standout, so good in his easy malevolence that he actually makes the thought of Allegiant as a movie quite appealing.In the final analysis, Divergent is likely to divide audiences. Fans of Roth's books should be, on the whole, pleased. This is a frequently very good, intelligent adaptation of a rather problematic novel. Everyone else, however, might be less enamoured of the final product: a film that, just like the book on which it is based, boasts a compelling story and some great ideas, but is also messily executed, overly complicated and a tad nonsensical."
tt1840309,5.0,"Every studio hopes for a hit YA franchise, and in particular for Lionsgate-owned Summit Entertainment, the imperative is even stronger seeing as how they had unearthed that lucrative segment with the 'Twilight' series. And so 'Divergent' comes with high hopes that not only will it become hit YA property, it could potentially enjoy the same astronomical success as 'The Hunger Games', especially since both are of the sci-fi genre set in a post-apocalyptic world with fresh young faces.Adapted from Veronica Roth's book, it imagines a dystopia where society is organised into five distinct factions based on personality types, each understanding and playing its role in order to keep the peace. These are Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite, the names rather self-explanatory in describing what they represent. Youths are tested at the age of 16, given two likeliest factions from the results of a hallucinatory test, and then at a Choosing Day ceremony made to pick one of the two in which they choose to belong.As narrated by our lead character Beatrice Prior (The Descendants' Shailene Woodley), there are those fit into more than two categories which are labelled 'divergents' and cast out to live as homeless vagabonds on the pretense that they do not belong. Needless to say, Beatrice is a titular 'divergent', and warned by her testor (Maggie Q) that she must keep this information secret lest she be the subject of a witchhunt led by the leader of the snobbish Erudite faction Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet). So at her ceremony, unlike all the others, she exercises her free will to join the Dauntless, who train to be soldiers keeping the peace.Even with the task of laying franchise groundwork, it is both surprising and disappointing how much time the movie spends inside the subterranean Pit where Tris and the rest of her initiates train under the tough yet tender Instructor Four (Theo James) and the harsh and controlling leader Eric (Jai Courtney). From sparring to knife throwing to shooting, screen writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor spend about an hour laying out Tris' Dauntless boot-camp training and the dynamics between the trainees, in particular with two Candors - one a snide competitor played by Miles Teller and the other a loyal friend played by Zoe Kravitz.There is of course the budding romance between Tris and Instructor Four, the latter of which turns out to be a 'divergent' himself and who ends up teaching her how to overcome the final 'fear test' of her training. At no point however does director Neil Burger inject a sense of urgency into the proceedings, which unfold relatively unhurried and without consequence until the final half-hour. It is at best a drag, at worst a bore, and while parallels have been drawn between Tris' training and Katniss Everdeen's in 'The Hunger Games', you'll find the former here oddly devoid of danger or purpose.Only in the last segment is there some measure of thrill as a power struggle between the Erudites and the Abnegations build up into real conflict unfolding on the streets of an already war-ravaged Chicago. Burger assumes that his audience's patience will eventually pay off in a rushed final act that throws everything it can into the mix - including some heavy urban warfare, exposition, shifts in character - but it is a peculiar case of 'too much too late' that ends up making you frustrated more than anything else. There is little poignancy even with two key supporting characters meeting their demises within the short span of ten minutes, and that is also a result of the film's flawed construct, which diminishes the familial bonds illustrated in the novel between Tris and her parents (Tony Goldwyn and Ashley Judd) and twin brother (Ansel Elgort).With little chance to flex her acting muscles, Woodley is hardly any match for Jennifer Lawrence, and indeed doesn't quite grasp her character well enough to put forth a consistent and compelling portrait of Beatrice. At least she does share some screen chemistry with Underworld: Awakening's Theo James, the bond that builds slowly between them rather winning to say the least. Other thespians like Winslet and Judd give solid supporting turns, though they are yet again hemmed in by a ham-fisted script that hews too closely to the book's straightforward prose.On his part, Burger tries his best to build a convincing vision of a futuristic Chicago, but fails to convey the extent of a hyper- militarized and technologically advanced society on the verge of factional conflict. The postwar cityscape hardly leaves much of an impression, though the drug-induced mind trips that Beatrice takes boasts some degree of visual ingenuity that recalls Burger's far superior work in 'The Illusionist' and 'Limitless'. Worthy of special mention though is the score by Junkie XL (with Hans Zimmer listed as executive music producer), which hits the right notes more than you would expect in certain scenes.Still, it's hard to imagine 'Divergent' being the kickstarter the way the first 'Hunger Games' movie was; though both share similar narrative blueprints, this adaptation feels inert where the latter is lively, failing to engage its audience with its female teenage protagonist's rite of passage. Unless you're a fan of the books, you'll probably be lukewarm about the next instalment 'Insurgent' whose production is already underway; indeed, true to its title, there is something off about 'Divergent' that never quite reconciles even till the end of the movie."
tt0115964,6.0,"David Cronenburg's interesting but flawed film 'Crash', adapted from James Ballard's novel (Ballard also gives his name to the leading character), attracted huge amounts of controversy on its release and has one of the most striking voting profiles on IMDB that I have seen - also equal returns for every number from 1 to 10.  In fact, there's a lot of admire in this sweaty, atmospheric adaptation that perfectly captures the sense of heightened alienation that charactersises much of Ballard's prose.  While among the cast, Deborah Kara Unger is sexy as always, Elias Koteas is suitably creepy and even James Spader is kind-of OK, if you don't mind him doing that ""lost little college boy grown up to be a pervert"" thing that he first perfected as Graham in 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape', a role he basically reprises here.But - and let's get real for a minute - this is a film about people who are turned on by car crashes! Now, what the hell is that all about?  If you ask me, the film is trying to say something about the need for transgression in an age with no real taboos - so its characters push at an endlessly receding door, until in the end only death itself can offer a way out.  The problem is that the film suffers from the same problems as the world it portrays - these people have no moral rules, so their actions carry no implications beyond themselves - which leaves us with an idea, with happenings, but no narrative ""drive"" as such.  Without anything to set against their nihilistic desires, 'Crash' coveys no sense of tragedy; just driving around in cars, with sex."
tt0115964,5.0,"Kids, read no farther. In fact, leave the room and play Nintendo. And put your dirty socks in the hamper.If you think YOU'RE warped wait until you see the characters who populate this movie. You'll not only emerge from the experience reassured, you'll wind up feeling like a paragon of normality.The story (if that's the word for it) has Spader getting into a head-on smasheroo with a car in which Hunter is a passenger. Her husband is thrown through the windshield and killed. Spader is hospitalized with various pieces of shiny steel holding his long bones in place. He finds the pain and discomfort and immobilization so arousing that when his wife (Unger) visits him it leads to masturbation. There's a lot of that sort of thing in this movie.You'd never think Holly Hunter would suffer from such a paraphilia but she does. So does Spader's wife. Hunter and Spader run into each other, figuratively, in a garage full of wrecked cars and make furious love in one of the surrealistically twisted carcasses.Before you know it, the Spader family and Hunter have fallen in with a group of -- well, there's no easy name for people of this quality. Koteas, the head of this underground cohort, is some sort of show-business stunt driver who, with a few associated, restages fatal car crashes of celebrities. Spader and Hunter are one of a dozen or two spectators who come to watch the staging of the 1955 crash between James Dean's Porsche and a Ford driven by somebody named Turnipseed. None of the men involved in the stunt wear helmets or seat belts and there are no roll bars or any of that wimpy stuff. Koteas' shiny Porsche Spider backs up, then speeds full blast into the front of the Ford. Kaboom. Sirens burping, the cops arrive and everyone scuttles for cover. It is never explained exactly how Koteas makes enough money to smash up beautifully restored Fords and Porsches. (His next big show will involve the decapitation of Jane Mansfield.) At Koteas' home they watch movies of test crashes with dummies instead of porn.Spader's wife has seemed relatively reasonable up to now but she finds herself turned on by crashes, stunt men, and the rest. When she and Spader are making love (this time in bed, not in the back seat), she asks about Koteas. ""Did you see his penis?"" Spader: ""He says it's all scarred from a motorcycle accident."" Unger ecstatically: ""Ewwwww."" Anyway, to get on with it, one thing leads to another -- one thing being crashes and the other being flaming death amidst twisted metal. What with everyone being swept up in the craze and wanting still more of the excitement, the only sensible way to arouse and satisfy your wife is to smash into her car and kill her, right? Two Big Os for the price of one -- Orgasm through Obliteration. So Spader continually rams the convertible driven by his willing wife until it flips over on the side of the highway. But she's not dead after all. ""I'm all right,"" she mumbles. ""Maybe next time. Maybe next time,"" he whispers to her and then does her bloody and half conscious body in the sere grass.So what's it all about, you ask? You might find that SOME people have no idea but I have a very firm answer. I don't know. At one point Spader asks Koteas why he's so interested in this stuff and Koteas replies portentously: ""It's the reshaping of the human body by modern technology."" Gosh.It's an awesome statement but what does it mean? How is modern technology reshaping the human body? Does he mean that vehicular accidents tear it all to bits? Is he somehow thinking of the Thighmaster or simulacrum that imitate rowing or cross-country skiing or walking upstairs? Is Cronenberg really after ROCK HARD ABS? Here's what I think he's up to. It's been called self testing. It's seeing how far you can violate ordinary tastes and still get away with it, rather like a toddler who insists on wobbling along by himself until he either falls down or somebody picks him up. The real message of the movie is that there is no message. It's a highly ritualized violation of the viewer's expectations of taste. A Halloween prank.What else could it be? It's certainly not a realistic portrayal of a bunch of perverts. Where could they possibly get insurance after the first dozen crashes? And the fear and sexual responses are antagonistic, the former mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the latter by the parasympathetic. Somebody who jumps off a cliff might have a spontaneous ejaculation, a sympathetic reflex, but he's not going to have an erection.I don't mean to pan the movie entirely. Unger and Hunter and Roseanna Arquette are sexy and attractive women. (There's a homosexual encounter involving Spader and Koteas, but it's not sufficiently prolonged or explicit to be anhedonic.) At any randomly chosen moment, the screen will show cars on the highway, cars crashing, people having sex in cars, or people talking about cars crashing and people having sex in cars. And it's neatly directed too. What shiny metal and what frangible flesh! Everything but the bodies seem gleaming and cold.My only problem was that I didn't like it. Not my perversion."
tt0115964,6.0,"David Cronenberg is for me one of the most interesting and unlike any other out there directors (even if not quite one of my personal favourites), despite being known for body horror and originating it his films are much more than that. They are incredibly well made, and as well as being unsettling some have a dark yet subtle wit or a poignant emotional core. All these are the reasons for my admiration and appreciation for him.Of all his films, 'Crash' (not to be confused with the film that, undeservedly in my opinion, won the Best Picture Oscar in its year, over the infinitely superior 'Brokeback Mountain', but that's another story) is his most controversial, causing a stir in Britain at the time. One can totally see why, with its uncompromising and difficult subject matter being portrayed unsettlingly and uniquely, something that fascinated and disturbed many yet sickened and perplexed just as many others. When it comes to me and my perception of 'Crash', it is a bit of a tricky one and not an easy film to rate and review. Do not consider it a misunderstood masterpiece or one of his best, at the same it's far from being on my worst films ever list and doesn't crash and burn. It's certainly an interesting and well made film, but other Cronenberg films connected with me far more emotionally and had me gripped more. Especially 'Dead Ringers' and 'The Fly'.Contrary to what those who hated 'Crash' say, those who say that there are no redeeming qualities whatsoever (personally can never say that about any lesser Cronenberg), there is a lot to admire. As with all Cronenberg films, 'Crash' looks great, with photography that is both beautiful, almost dream-like in places, and harrowing, when at its most harrowing it really hits hard. Absolutely loved the opening credits sequence, Cronenberg always delivers in this aspect. A lot of effort clearly went into the design of it visually, it is beautiful to watch while also being very creepy. Howard Shore's score does add quite a bit, it is truly haunting stuff that also brings shivers down the spine when necessary. Cronenberg's style is unmistakable, if more purposefully clinical than usual.He does admirably adhere close to the detached nature of the source material, which accounts for why viewers were and still are left cold and why his direction is more clinical. What is most interesting about the film and why it is controversial is its depiction of sex and violence, there is a lot of both, very daring and shocking at the time (still is) and both had seldom been depicted in this way before. The violence is uncompromising and does churn the stomach, even those who have seen a lot of violent films (myself included) will find themselves deeply disturbed. The sex scenes are beautifully choreographed and filmed while also being a mix of explicit, sensual, strange and ominous. When they merge, the depiction is vividly graphic, and for quite a large number it was/is hard to take, to me it was harrowing but in a way it intrigued. The film also made me think. Despite never getting to know the characters (Vaughan is the most interesting) or care for them, that doesn't stop Cronenberg from drawing great performances from a gifted cast. Found the standouts to be Elias Koteas, quite frightening here, and Deborah Kara Unger, who is equally astonishing.On the other hand, it is very easy to see why anybody would say 'Crash' is a challenging film and hard to like. While appreciating what it set out and tried to do, the emotional investment wasn't there for me, things that were there in 'Dead Ringers' and 'The Fly', and there were times where the intentional coldness was overdone. Likewise with the bizarre factor, especially later on where things increasingly stop making sense until an ending that leaves one dumbfounded-ly scratching their heads.While some of 'Crash' was thought-provoking, it was not always easy understanding what the point of it was and what it was trying to say. It also became repetitive with the sexual acts and violence becoming more frequent and in some cases not necessary, some of the film was pretty uneventful dramatically, the pace was very sluggish and the film could have been 20-25 minutes shorter because there was not enough plot, which was fairly slight structurally to begin with, to sustain the film's length.In summary, didn't bowl me over and the controversy is more than understandable, but do highly appreciate the effort and can't be too hard on it. 6/10"
tt0115964,6.0,"James Ballard, a TV director who is going through a complicated phase at a professional and personal level, suffers a car accident that transports him to an urban sub-culture, where victims of car accidents have sex in order to rejuvenate and give meaning to their lives.It's a bizarre film, at least, dark, psychologically disturbing, and uncomfortable, for the vast majority of the audience.This film explores certain psychological changes that a person may suffer after a trauma, instincts and ingrained desires, which needed the right moment to emerge.The characters are cold, lacking a solid background, disconnected from emotions, which are linked only by carnal attraction and the primitive and violent sexual desire.It's a metaphor about our relationship with technology and the progressive loss of connections with other individuals, but I don't think it had the best execution."
tt0115964,6.0,"David Cronenberg's most recent film. Set in Los Angeles, James Spader and Deborah Unger play a couple drawn into an  underworld of odd characters who are sexually aroused by automobile crashes. Spader discovers this when he hits Holly  Hunter's car head on, killing her husband. They become lovers, meeting in a parking garage, having (unsatisfying) sex in a parked car. Later they are involved with a clique that re-enacts famous crashes for excitement.It's a fascinating premise and it starts off quite promising. However, Spader's patented flat, emotionally dead anti-hero never shows a spark of life. Nor do any of the other characters. And yet, while there is an attempt to capture that serene surface perfected by David Lynch, the attempt fails. In the end we do not care what happens to any of these characters. It becomes an exercise in guessing who will sleep with who next. Even the final scene, in which Spader and Unger are brought back together, fails to move because we have never cared about either of them. It felt like getting the news that your cousin twice removed, who you have never met, is getting married. You know you are supposed to feel happy for them but, frankly, you just don't care.On the other hand, the movie is visually lush, and does take some legitimate risks. Spader has a gay sex-scene that, as tame as it was, is a true rarity in American theaters. Even ""Faith! Hope! and Glory!"" did not come close. One scene deserves especial mention. A group including Spader, Hunter, and Rosanne Arquette are watching video tapes of safety tests of automobiles, starring the test dummies. As they watch they become increasingly aroused. They are all completely absorbed in films that were shot by engineers. Like low-budget porn, the videos are grainy, out of focus, and have no camera movement. Nevertheless, the scene is oddly hysterical.Cronenberg also keeps close to home in another way. He always seems to be obsessed with violation. In his films this is represented literally. Here we have a number of characters whose bodies are violated with pins and braces administered by doctors. Not for the squeamish, although the scenes are not gory. But to see the male nurse just poking at people's apparatus and wounds is unsettling (recalls the Monty Python skit where the major missing a leg has it poked by his superior office, asking if it hurts)."
tt0115964,6.0,"I had read the novel and was very curious to see what David Cronenberg would do.  The book was somewhat better, but I thought the movie was very intelligent, disturbing and outrageous.  The cast does well, especially Deborah Kara Unger, who gives the best performance in the movie. As usual, Cronenberg creates another world, and either you want to go there or not, but this time it ended up being fascinating, for me at least."
tt0115964,6.0,"There is the very real possibility that CRASH is an elaborate joke. That is the only way that this monumentally idiotic mess could possibly be explained. Certainly there is nothing in this silliness that in any way touches upon normal human behavior as most people understand it. Indeed, I even suspect you would have trouble finding any psychologist or psychiatrist who would have ever encountered the type of freaky weirdoes who populate this film -- or for that matter even have read about such freaky weirdoes in text books. The film deals with people who get sexual aroused by automobile accidents and the pain and suffering such wrecks cause. I suppose anything is possible and such people may exist, but CRASH takes it one step further and suggests that there is this cult of individuals who somehow network to fulfill their fantasies of motorized mayhem. Two such characters are played by Holly Hunter and James Spader. In a most grotesque parody of ""meeting cute"" the two encounter each other when he crosses the center line and smashes head-on into her car, killing her husband and apparently getting her hot and bothered in the process. Hunter's Helen is already into smashup sex, so, after a stay in the hospital, the grieving widow naturally rushes Spader -- playing James Ballard, the author of the original novel -- into her small band of bumper car aficionados. In addition to being wreck 'n' roll fanatics, the people must also be incredibly rich. They like to recreate infamous celebrity auto accidents, such as James Dean's roadside death. For instance, to do so, they have to buy or recreate not only a replica of Dean's rare 1955 Porsche Spyder, but also an almost equally rare 1950 Ford coupe that was the other car involved in the crash. With these and a variety of other new and used cars, we're talking about thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars for autos destined to be demolished in the name of foreplay. Talk about expensive quickies. A couple of tickets to a demolition derby would be far more economical -- and a virtual orgy. Of course, the film isn't really about auto eroticism; it is about sexual obsession in general. The fetish in question could have been about anything that inspires abnormal lust. The characters could have been turned on by, say, internet porn, gambling, bungee jumping, farm animals or jiggling Jell-O molds. But, gosh darn it, car wrecks are so much more photogenic. It doesn't seem to bother the filmmakers that they are perpetuating a correlation between sex and violence, because, well, they apparently believe such a link already exists. Nor do they seem to be aware that they are undermining their own efforts by building an oh-so serious drama around a ludicrously grim (and lame) joke. As such, the insipidness of the story is accentuated by the pomposity of the storytelling. Director David Cronenberg approaches the story as though he were Igmar Bergman directing PERSONA. Other than a few lapses, the film is cold and lifeless and empty; though it is somewhat appropriate that a film celebrating a sexual obsession with automobiles would depict sex as an utterly mechanical act. Cronenberg and crew do slip up a couple of times and inspire moments worthy of laughing out loud. One scene in particular is hilarious: Hunter and several others are lounging around watching videos of auto crash tests like they are watching porn videos; One particularly messy smash up prompts Hunter to excitedly demand that it be shown again in slow motion. Crash dummies watching crash dummies, as it were.There is an unwritten rule of movie sex: If films featuring explicit sex are fun and comic, then it is pornographic; but if the sex is joyless, degrading and dispassionate, then it is art -- or, sex as something good is dirty; sex as something bad is honest. It is this simplistic, neo-puritanical attitude that makes films like CRASH so insultingly hypocritical: Make a big deal about filming graphic, lurid sex scenes, then condescendingly shake one's finger at the audience to remind them how perverse such activity is. It's like slipping an alcoholic a drink in order to self-righteously chastise him for being a drunk. Had the filmmakers shucked the smug moralizing and openly played the material as sly satire, perhaps CRASH could have been a sharp commentary on modern romance, both between people and with their cars -- speeding as flirtation, road rage as rape, reckless driving as masturbation, the head-on collision as the one night stand; marriage as the aftermath of roadside carnage. But I don't think the film has the courage or the intellect to explore such themes. The film plays it safe, giving us a tale of obsession where the obsession is devoid of the thrill, the energy or the naughtiness of actually giving in to an impulse. It's an addiction without a high, but worse no expectation of there being a high. Here is a film that wants us to identify with a psychological quirk that is, to say the least, ridiculous, but it doesn't even make the effort to frame the quirk in a realistic fashion. How are we to care one way or the other -- emotionally, dramatically, socially or even clinically -- about people the film itself seems to regard as emotionally dead freaks? CRASH thinks it is speeding recklessly down uncharted roads, but it is up on blocks, spinning its wheels and destined for the junkyard."
tt0115964,5.0,"David Cronenberg likes to push the envelope in film.  With Scanners, he ushered in a new wave of horror.  With The Dead Zone, he gave us horror of a more subdued kind.  With The Fly, he remade a sci-fi classic and gave it a new spin.  And with Dead Ringers, he explored the strange dual life of twins.  With Crash, Cronenberg pushes us, but I don't know what kind of repsonse he was going for.  The story concerns James Ballard and a group of crash enthusiasts.  After his initial crash, Ballard meets up with Helen Remington and a mysterious man named Vaughn. Ballard is soon introduced to the strange world of car crashes, and the rush of sexual tension. Now I can see where there is a thin line that separates these two acts. Both bring out a strong physical and emotional reaction, but the characters in the film are too detached from life. There is sex without pleasure, and the only way these people can experience pleasure, is through the trauma of an automobile accident.  The film moves along at a leisurely pace and nothing ever really happens.  There is no dramatic need that these characters have to fill.  There is no urgency in their actions and their motivations are clouded, by what I interpret as boredom. Cronenberg has done some fine work in the past, and I think he'll come along and shock us with a truly original film.  Until then, stick with the four I mentioned at the top."

The constant repetitive flashbacks only inching each time just a little more facts on her past incident also became annoying. Just spit it out, and move on with the current drama and all too little excitement. Never mind it was totally boring and pointless for the movies plot-line. Even the idea of the cat and mouse wasn't concluded, nor why it even started or who ordered it. The screenplay felt like it had random scenes cut out and/or was poorly edited. The 100 min runtime felt much longer with all the boring filler. I'm not sure if the book is as bad at the screenplay and direction, but this one had a great conceptual idea that ultimately burns out quickly. Jolie was the worst casting choice, and for the most part was unconvincing in her role and her acting abilities.

tt3215824,5.0,"There are times when a movie comes out of nowhere, only a few weeks before its theatrical release, the trailer is released and the poster is revealed and we then only know that it's acted by some famous celebrities and this time around, it's Angelina Jolie. Those Who Wish Me Dead is one of those movies where it feels so sudden, and the next thing you know, it's right there in the list of 'Now Showing'.Here's a list of FAQ that some of you cinephiles are looking for.Question #1: Does Angelina Jolie have ample screen time?Suggested by the poster is a hint that Jolie will be given plentiful screen time which means that audience will think she is the lead character for the film. But the truth is, she's not. The main character here is the boy, portrayed by Finn Little who gets lost in the woods after an unfortunate incident happens. This means that the story revolves around him, Jolie is better said to occupy the supporting role. She has a lot of screen time right after she finds the lost boy. So no worries, she is still the spotlight!Question #2: How is this compared to Taylor Sheridan's previous film, Wind River?Wind River sets in snow while Those Who Wish Me Dead sets in the wilderness ablaze territory. In addition, Sheridan also writes the screenplay for Hell or High Water, sets in the dessert. We see that Sheridan has a pattern of using different geographical landscapes to build his film's premise. Wind River uses its landmark explicably well, with rising tension and rich storytelling that absorb the audience with its setting. This film tries to do that with a similar concept of cat-and-mouse game however, this film falls flat. There's something missing here. It's like the story is figuring out where to go along the way while it's being unfolded. It's unsure with the direction it's heading unlike Wind River. Coming in with a mediocre expectation, I found this to be... okay. Wind River wins by miles.Question #3: This film is rated-R, how violence it is?Yessss, I'm glad that this is rated-R. This is one of the things I like about this film. Because of its adult content, it doesn't hold its punches when it comes to showing gory stuff. There are even some highlight moments that can get your adrenaline moving fast.Question #4: Never seen Finn Little before, is he any good?From my viewing, he's got a pretty good acting skill. He has been in Angel of Mine and 2067 but those aren't blockbusters so probably a lot are wondering, 'Who the hell is this boy?'. He's good, but not good enough cause I wish they can somehow replace him with Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place, Wonder, Honey Boy). I feel that he can play the part much better cause he's more suitable with the role, honestly.Question #5: How about the CGI? Is it realistic enough?Some frames are but others aren't. There are times where you'd gob-smack seeing how realistic the fire is similar if you've seen Only the Brave. But there are shots that are edited badly, you know it's CGI the second you see them.Question #6: Seeing that this is a survival genre, does the story keep you engaged?The story isn't as heavy as Wind River or Hell or High Water. It's meant to be made commercial where the story doesn't come out as heavy for the general audience. The story is simple with a little bit of flair and it keeps the audience engaged by hooking them with riddles as the core question to why all of this is happening is hidden. However... however by the end, the audience is left with many questions as well as only a few that has been answered. Like mentioned earlier in Question #2, it has no clear direction to where the story is heading.Question #7: What is your overall thought for Those Who Wish Me Dead?I pretty much felt like there's a lot more to be desired. The pacing is slow enough with merely basis storytelling going on it makes me fidget during the first half. Only the second half when things get exciting. This is one of those movies where you watch for the sake of its action or actors but it's not mindless either. When you leave the theatre, you'll at least get some knowledge on how to survive a lightning strike or forest fire. Overall, this is an okay movie.Question #8: Who should watch Those Who Wish Me Dead?Those who:-Want to see Angelina Jolie kicks ass.Love assassination films.Are devoted fans of Taylor Sheridan's previous portfolio.Want to grasp how-to-survive tips.Don't mind major plot holes.Verdict: Those Who Wish Me Dead delves deep into the burning forest with sharp survival skills however, it forgets to leave behind a compelling script resulting in a thin narrative that can only go as far as a horse running from a ruthless predator."
tt3215824,6.0,"A brand new movie just added to HBO Max. A traumatized and retired firefighter who had to protect a boy from those who wish him dead.When I saw the trailer, I expected a pretty simple thriller. And I was right. The trailer showed most of the story. The plot was seen a bunch of times before, so there wasn't any surprises here.The acting was pretty decent across the board. There wasn't much complex emotion or scenes that required these actors to show their best.Even though the plot was simple, I still wanted a decent thriller, and the movie gave me that. There were some pretty okay and intense action scenes, and they were handled well.My biggest problem was the characters. At the beginning, the movie showed the event that traumatized the main character, played by Jolie. However, I did not see the significance of this event to the story at all. It didn't impact her character when she was in the action scenes.Besides the main character, there were minimal development to the other characters. Jon Bernthal was badass as usual, but I didn't care for his character much, or any other characters.Overall, a decent thriller, but everything else was average and not memorable. There's no need to watch this movie. 6/10."
tt3215824,5.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. Taylor Sheridan was Oscar nominated for his screenplay of the superb HELL OR HIGH WATER (2016). He also wrote and directed WIND RIVER (2017), wrote the screenplays for both SICARIO movies, and is the creative force behind the TV series ""Yellowstone"". He has excelled in generating slow-burn tension and conflict. For his latest film, he's back in the director's chair after co-writing the script with Charles Leavitt (BLOOD DIAMOND, 2006) and the 2014 novel's author, Michael Koryta.Oscar winner Angelina Jolie stars as Hannah, a thrill-seeking smokejumper (those folks who jump out of airplanes to fight fires and save lives) burdened with a faulty decision that cost lives in a massive forest fire the previous year. After flunking her psyche-evaluation, Hannah packs up the blame and her flashbacks and accepts her low-key assignment to the solitude of ""Fire Tower"", a lookout perched above the tree line of Soda Butte, a park area within Yellowstone that encompasses the Continental Divide. Early on we see the camaraderie of the smokejumpers as they tease each other and ""welcome"" the new firefighters to the park.In a seemingly unrelated storyline (although we know the intersection is coming), Owen (Jake Weber, ""Medium"") and his son Connor (Finn Little) take an emergency detour on the way to school. Owen is a forensic accountant who uncovered some corruption while working for a Florida DA who was recently murdered by the same hitmen now chasing Owen and his son. Soon, Connor is wandering alone through the forest looking for someone he can trust, and up pops Hannah. The pair of calm-cool-collected hitmen are played by Aidan Gillen (""Game of Thrones"") and Nicholas Hoult (MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, 2015). They track down Owen's brother-in-law Ethan (Jon Bernthal, BABY DRIVER, 2017), who happens to work for the sheriff's department in the same park.Whether you call it a hunt or a chase, it's always a bit creepy when professional hitmen are tracking down an innocent kid, and the tension is elevated when we see the bad guys take their direction from a higher-up bad buy played by Tyler Perry in one brief scene. The film features a hand full of excellent action sequences, including a shootout between the hitmen and Ethan's pregnant wife Allison (Medina Senghore). Conveniently, Allison runs a survivor camp, and despite her belly, manages to put up quite a fight.Cinematographer Ben Richardson (BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD, 2012) capitalizes on the extraordinary vastness and beauty of Soda Butte, and some of the forest fire effects are so good we can almost feel the heat. The supporting cast is excellent and the multiple story lines all work together nicely. For me, what prevented the film from reaching the level it could have, was the presence and performance of Angelina Jolie. Her last action movie was SALT in 2010, and here she seems too concerned with a look of glamor - right down to consistently brushed hair and perfect make-up - than fitting the profile of the courageous (and slightly off-center) smokejumpers. She stands out from the others on the team not because of her inherent extreme risk-taking, but rather because of her magazine-cover approach - something not limited to the hair and make-up, but also her posing and preening, including many of the same gazes from other movies like GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS (2000). I often admire and respect the choices actors make, but in this case, those choices work against everything else in what could have been an excellent dramatic thriller.Now available on HBO Max."
tt3215824,6.0,"I sat down to watch the 2021 movie ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" here in 2021 as I was sort of made to do so, given the fact that my wife wanted to watch it. So I buckled in and went to watch it with her.Granted, I wasn't really expecting much of anything grand here from writers Michael Koryta, Charles Leavitt and Taylor Sheridan. So I would say that director Taylor Sheridan definitely had all the chances to impress me with ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"".And let me just say that ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" was actually an adequately entertaining and enjoyable movie. It had that particular classic thriller sense to it that made movies had back in the 1980s. So that definitely worked out for me.The storyline in the movie was good. Sure, this wasn't exactly rocket science, but the script provided me with adequate entertainment and enough suspense to keep it interesting.""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" had a good ensemble of actors and actresses to help bring the movie to life on the screen, with the likes of Angelina Jolie, Jon Bernthal, Aidan Gillen and Nicholas Hoult.Visually then ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" was fairly good. However, the scene with the rapidly spreading fire in the forest was just a bit over the top. Now, I am by no means traversed in the science of forest fires, but the speed that the fire spread with just seemed way too impossible. Sure, it made for intense entertainment, but...While ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" definitely was watchable, the movie just doesn't really have the contents to support more than just a single viewing, as the storyline just doesn't carry the leverage for such. And this movie is hardly one that left me impressed, and I believe that it is one that will slowly fade into oblivion among a sea of other similar movies.Ultimately, then I am rating ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" a six out of ten stars."
tt0082186,6.0,"BEWARE--do NOT let Classical Studies professors or anyone obsessed with Greek Mythology watch this film! They will either have a stroke or spend the entire movie complaining how almost NONE of the plot is really taken from classical mythology but is a lot of hooey. Plus, it's got some really dopey moments (such as the mechanical owl--what a dreary character). BUT, if you don't care that it isn't really based on real myths and just turn off your brain, it's actually pretty good. In fact of all the Ray Harryhausen-created special effect movies about the Greeks, it's probably the best (though his all-time best film has got to be EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS). Watch it and enjoy the action. Just don't try to think too much--it will probably make your head hurt!"
tt0477392,5.0,"I have seen many movies over the years, so I may be a little too discriminating. That said, Broken Bridges did not live up to my expectations. The writing wasn't the best. The directing wasn't the best. And the sound people should never work in Hollywood again.That's not to say that Toby Keith is a bad actor. Quite the contrary, he shows real potential, and I really hope to see him in other movies, hopefully movies that are better written and allow Toby to really show his acting chops. Toby said that while it may not seem like a stretch, he is really different from his character, and unlike the real life Toby, Bo is struggling with his career. Toby...you're a great singer, brilliant songwriter, outstanding performer...but this wasn't much of a stretch. A cop, a lawyer, a teacher, or even a biker allows you to try out your acting chops. Toby plays a country singer, and Toby is really a country singer. Toby Keith's character dresses like...Toby Keith. But Toby did give a good performance, so I applaud him for that.Lindsey Haun had better become a big star. She's beautiful, and shes a great singer and actress...a double WHAMMY! Her performance of Broken was one of the highlights of the movie. This wasn't a huge blockbuster film, but I hope it was big enough to get people to notice this great talent.The soundtrack was very good, I'll give it that. But I was expecting much more with this film. It's great that so many people on here like it. It just wasn't for me."

Angela is shocked to find Dixie's father, fading country singer Bo Price (Toby Keith), has also returned.Toby Keith is a stiff actor. I'm trying to accept that for this character. He's a piece of stone stuck in the middle of the screen. Kelly Preston is no great catch either. It's more interesting to see Burt again. The girl shows different sides and out performs everybody else. The music is pretty good and that helps a lot. Otherwise, it's a relatively unimaginative melodrama."
tt10160976,6.0,"Given that The Nun (2018) was nothing more than a polished-looking series of loud noises and nonsensical happenings, I was not looking forward to the sequel.And even though The Nun II has its share of cheap scares and a few unintentionally funny moments, I was shocked by how much better it is than the first film.Flashes of greatness are seen here-more often than not it's directed with considerable skill and far more restraint than the first movie was. It's quieter and more patient at first, fleshing out its characters before things get insane in the third act.As for these character dynamics, they're actually interesting this time around. The dialogue is sometimes cheesy, but there's a sincerity to the humans in this story that gives a gripping quality to the film's perilous moments.There's certainly quite a bit of bad to be found here, but I actually liked more of this than I didn't. Hopefully these movies will get back to being good."
tt10160976,5.0,"In my opinion, the character ""The Nun a.k.a (Valak)"" was best portrayed in the movie ""The Conjuring 2"". I didn't like its first solo movie. The atmosphere wasn't bad, but I didn't like it anyway. I didn't like the second movie either. It could be better. In terms of atmosphere, it wasn't as good as the first movie. The plot of the movie was poor. There ara lots of horror movie clichés. There were many jump-scare scenes. I thought it was out of fashion nowadays, but they used it too much in this movie. This spoils the viewing pleasure. There were a few scenes that I liked very much. Even though it was a jump-scare scene, I liked the goat scene. The acting was good, of course, but the weak script. BTW Bonnie Aarons was great again."
tt10160976,6.0,"My dedication to the horror genre leads me to seeing a lot of films at the cinema that I fully expect to be rubbish. Like the Nun II, which I had very little real interest in watching since I couldn't remember much about the first one, other than the fact that I didn't like it. And for a long time, the film is just as bland and generic as I had imagined it would be, director Michael Chaves taking matters far too seriously, with a dreary pace, gloomy cinematography and all of the religious horror clichés he can cram in.Then, just as I was about to give up all hope of being entertained, Chaves seems to remember that, hey, horror films can be fun! After the introduction of a demonic goat (Satan himself?), the film really picks up, with action, excitement, and a few well-crafted scares (I think I actually jumped a couple of times, but that was probably down to the extremely loud noises that accompany the jumpy bits). If only there had been some of this liveliness during the earlier parts of the film - The Nun II could have been really good instead of just okay.My rating: 6/10."
tt10160976,5.0,"So, I was actually quite looking forward to this one. I wasn't expecting much from the original since sequels, prequel's and spinoffs often times are not up to par with their predecessors. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised with the first Nun and still think that it is a wildly underrated horror. So, after viewing this one, I must say that I was pretty disappointed. It was not a bad film by any means, but it did not live up to the quality of the first one and really landed in a very mediocre place.It had a quick start and didn't waste any time, throwing us into the action. Yet, even then, I stopped and thought ""well, that could've been cooler "". This same sentiment persisted throughout the majority of the film. It gave us some fun and creepiness, but then proceeded to move at a snails pace for quite some time. It felt like we were about 45 minutes in until I got any semblance of a real story line or something particularly intriguing. It really felt like they were going through the motions, an outline for a horror movie. As if they were following a map with very similar chain of events as the original.It is no secret that this franchise loves a jump scare. The first one was full of them, however, it was also balanced out by genuinely creepy and cool effects with a general effective spook factor. This one had a bit of that, but was mostly just riddled with cheap, unnecessary and superfluous jump scares. Even most of the kills, while still entertaining, were pretty basic. At the same time there were also some effective imagery especially in the third act, some gnarly effects, and some pretty awesome stunts that stuck out.I think my biggest issue with this is that the first one felt very deliberate and purposeful in many ways. It felt planned out and detailed... whereas this one felt like it was thrown together with the very bare minimum they could get away with as far as storyline went. Again, not a bad film, but nowhere near the quality of the first one for me. Would recommend, but not vehemently.(Also, what's up with all these fake reviews? Weird. Lol)IG - howlingatthemoonreviews."
tt10160976,5.0,"So, 5 years after the release of The Nun, we get the The Nun 2, which after watching wasn't as great as I'd hoped!The film is set in France, 1956 where a Priest is murdered! An evil is spreading as Sister Irene once again comes face-to-face with Valak, the Demon Nun!I found the film to be ok, but a damper in comparison to its predecessor which is miles better than this! The film takes a while to get going & doesn't half drag & drag to the point where it you find yourself nearly falling asleep due to boredom!The film is 1 hour & 42 minutes in length, which a mid credits scene! The pacing is bad & the story is boring! That being said, the film does redeem itself with some scary visuals, jump scares & sinister goings on to be had in this film! The ending finale wasn't bad & pretty good!The characters aren't that interesting & that doesn't help with the mundane story & directing, which brings me to my next point, the film was Directed by Michael Chaves, who directed The Curse Of La Larona, which was ok, but nothing special & The Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It, which sucked! So of course, it shows his cursed directing shines through here as it was like those films, boring, flat & lacking in anything meaty & impact like!I see many people on here claiming this to be better than the first, it's not, not by a long shot! The first wasn't bang on perfect (what films are, seriously), but at least it was to the point & we saw the Nun Valak far more than in this to where we only see the Nun Valak for 5-10 Minutes of Screen Time tops!Overall, it's ok & not a bad watch, but I seriously couldn't get into this one due to the mundane story & flat characters! The Nun Valak was great in this despite being used too sparingly, as with the jump scares, visuals & spooky goings on! The film dragged too much, was overly long for what it was & felt pretty disjointed! It's not better than the first by a long shot! The first film is still the better film!5/10."
tt10160976,5.0,"Knowing that Ed is present for the exorcism of frenchie and that's technically a pivotal moment in the relationship of Ed and Loraine (according to the films), and the look Irene gives Frenchy at the end of the film makes me certain we're due for a 3rd Nun film. I had a feeling this movie was going to be a bit stale. The design and appearance of the Nun creeping in dark shadowy halls in the film has lost its shock factor. And the increased exposure of the creature has decreased the menacing creepiness of the Nun. It always was more terrifying when all you were able to see was a silhouette of the Nun and the pale face. I give them credit as they've built a pretty solid story building to the exorcism of Frenchy. They've also found creative ways of adding these religious relics to the storyline as weapons against the demon. When they first released Annabelle people were really creeped out by the dolls lore. In 2023 it's looked at as a new age Chucky doll attached to a major film franchise. It feels like the Conjuring Universe is building to something huge. I have said for years it's building to a Amityville Film as a grand finale. But after this film and the inevitable third film, it's clear that the franchise might want to find a new horrific creature from the cases of the Warren's to add to the library of horror."
tt15140278,6.0,"We were very lucky to attend an advance screening of Woody Allen's latest movie, ""Coup de Chance"" (Stroke of Luck) almost a whole month ahead of its Australian release. While it may not stand as his greatest work, the film is undeniably well-made and thoroughly entertaining. Set against the backdrop of Paris in the autumn, the cinematography captures the city's beauty, adding an extra layer of charm to the narrative.The film boasts decent acting performances, with the cast delivering their roles competently. However, it's hard to ignore the sense of déjà vu, especially if you've seen ""Matchpoint."" It's like Allen's taken a stroll down memory lane, rehashing some of his earlier ideas. While the familiarity may give a sense of nostalgia for longtime fans, it also left me yearning for something new from the seasoned filmmaker. Despite these echoes, ""Coup de Chance"" manages to create a compelling story, keeping the audience engaged with its well-paced plot and witty dialogue. In the end, Allen once again demonstrates his ability to craft an enjoyable cinematic experience, even if the shadows of his past successes loom in the background."
tt15140278,6.0,"The new Woody film is neither a masterpiece nor is it bad - as some reviews here seem to claim. It is actually better than some of his recent films (i.e ""Autumn in NY""). Parts of it reminded me of ""Scoop"" or even of the masterpiece that is ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"". Unfortunately without the humour and star actors of his older films. Although acting is decent and photography, script and directing are even better- it misses the quality and sparks that great stars have brought to Allen's films in the past turning a small-talk scene into something brilliant and funny or a personal impasse into tragedy.For Allen fans it is very pleasant entertainment with some Hitchcockian touches and a nice Paris-in-the-autumn atmosphere.The underlying ""philosophical"" motif of beleiving or not in the power of chance in life is rather superficially dealt with, rehashing the ideas of ""Matchpoint"". The ending could be more developed while the whole film seems at places to work on auto-pilot following similar plots of his previous films. However, as the ""captain"" here happens to be one of the greatest living directors who - despite his old age and the witch hunt against him- continues to offer us one film per year I can only say, thanks again Woody!"
tt15140278,5.0,"This movie is absolutely humourless and quite boring. I feel a deep disappointment about it. No sense of humour, no sense of crime no infidelity nothing to tell. Which should be the plot? Nothing to be remembered. Good actors, quite good music, fantastic Parisian scenes but nothing makes any sense. What happened to that Woody Allen director of magical and dreamful movies we all were in love with ? He seems having lost his gift to make us laugh for a long while. The movie is already too long cause nothing on the stage catches the viewers eyes . No emotions, nothing to laugh or cry for, nothing to do with usual Woody's filmography."
tt15140278,5.0,"And I haven't watched some of his more recent work.Written and directed by Allen, it's very much a movie in the Fench tradition, the tradition of Chabrol and Truffaut: Hitchcock minus the suspense.That's a real shame because Allen has is a great director of suspense, he proved that with movies like Crimes and Misdemeanor, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Match Point. This does not come near those titles.Allen is a master filmmakers. I am a big fan of his. Hannah and Her Sisters, Annie Hall, The Purple Rose of Cairo and Crimes & Misdemeanors are all time greats. I just can't understand why he'd want to make something like this. Something this empty and tedious. What's the point?"
tt15140278,6.0,"I appreciate Woody Allen's movies. He always tells stories about common ordinary people to whom unpredictable things (but sometimes also usual) happen. This is the case in this movie where Fanny and Jean live a happy marriage, loving each other deeply till thr moment when Fanny unpredictably meets Alain. An old high school fellow starting a love relatiomship after a short friendship one. This turns out into drama even a violent one when Jean knows Fanny's infidelity and arranges a plan to get Alain secretly killed. When Fanny's mother suspects it and tries to investigate it, Jean also plans to kill her himself but ends up by being killed by mistake by a hunter in a forest. This is a well made movie in every aspect but the story is not particularly interesting."
tt15140278,5.0,"I never fancied Woody Allen as a filmmaker, there's just something about his movies that I totally like like the dialogues that almost feel like they've been improvised on the spot and Chekhov's guns scattered around the movie but there's much more that I don't like and that is the lack of authenticity and overall sense in the whole narrative. For instance, the only movie of Allen's that I sat through in its entirety before this one was Annie Hall and I remember watching it and thinking to myself: what is the point of it all? Here's the same.Coup de chance is full of dialogues, I like to call that type of movies a 'talk movie' but whereas Tarantino or Scorsese dialogues are sophisticated, fun, thought-provoking and can easily be taught in a screenwriter academy Woody Allen dialogues are bland, lazy and written as if a night before shooting a scene.Main characters are lively though and they are the main reason I stuck with the movie until the end, they're the driving force of it but all in all everything else about the movie feels wrong and unnatural. When one and the same melody starts playing yet again for a fifth time it starts getting on your nerves; sure, I love Cantaloupe island by Herbie Hancock, it's a great melody, but it's been overused in the movie. Or did Woody just buy this lone song for this movie? Also, when you watch the final resolution in the movie and think to yourself: huh, how ironic - it's not a very good sign that you've watched a good movie, is it?"
tt15140278,6.0,"After being delayed by the COVID pandemic, Woody Allen takes us on a jaunt through autumnal Paris in Coup de Chance, a tale of forbidden love, sudden windfalls, and the fickle hand of fate. Lou de Laâge shines as Fanny, a woman trapped in a gilded cage, married to a wealthy, domineering tycoon (Melvil Poupaud). Enter Alain (Niels Schneider), a charming, penniless writer who ignites a passionate spark in Fanny's seemingly dormant heart. A chance lottery ticket, bought on a whim, sets the stage for a whirlwind of intrigue and moral quandaries.Allen's signature wit is sprinkled throughout the film, most effective in the early scenes where Fanny's suffocating marriage is punctured by hilarious exchanges with her neurotic mother (played with scene-stealing verve by Valérie Lemercier). But as the plot tightens and the stakes rise, the laughs simmer down, replaced by a Hitchcockian suspense that's undeniably gripping.Here's the problem: while the premise is enticing, the execution stumbles in spots. The pacing occasionally meanders, leaving us wanting a bit more oomph from the central love affair. And while Allen masterfully builds tension, the resolution feels somewhat tepid, like a souffle that didn't quite rise.Despite its shortcomings, Coup de Chance boasts undeniable charm. The camerawork is a love letter to Paris, capturing the city's golden hues and melancholic beauty. The performances are uniformly excellent, with de Laâge and Poupaud delivering nuanced portrayals of characters caught in a moral maze.So, should you gamble on Coup de Chance? Well, it's not a jackpot, but it's not a dud either. Think of it as a crisp autumn walk-pleasant, thought-provoking, but maybe lacking the fireworks of a summer blockbuster. If you're a Woody Allen aficionado or enjoy stylish dramas with a touch of suspense, it's worth a peek. Just don't expect to win the cinematic lottery."

tt0092718,5.0,"It's still hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that Patrick Dempsey in his arguable most popular role as the reserved, laid back, assured Dr. Derek ""McDreamy"" Shepherd from Grey's Anatomy used to actually play the role of the geek! lol Yes, way back in the 1980s (seems like a lifetime ago, which I guess it is), Dempsey regularly essayed the roles of awkward, frenetic, geeky nerds. The height of Dempsey's nerdom was in the 1987 to 1989 time period where he got to star in several serviceable comedies, including this one CAN'T BUY ME LOVE (1987). I recently re-watched this movie having not seen it in a very long time and one thing I forgot was how fast this movie moved. It really just goes from scene to scene not wasting much time. And despite being top heavy in terms of actors that carry the movie, namely Patrick Dempsey (as protagonist Ronald Miller), Amanda Peterson (as love interest Cindy Mancini) and Courtney Gains (as Ronald's best friend Kenneth Wurman), I really find the bulk of the supporting characters to be extremely shallow and forgettable. Contrast this to a film like the cult classic Three O'Clock High, which came out the
same year, and it's slew of memorable supporting and minor characters added on top of the two stellar main character performances. All the minor characters in this comedy piece felt like the same person.Another thing I realized upon re-watch is that the wardrobe department really went nuts trying to make Dempsey overly nerdy. I don't believe for a second that, even in the 80s, anyone would actually dress like Ronald did. The fact is that Dempsey was never really a nerd, but Hollywood actually tried to make us believe it. I also found it a bit absurd that Ronald this deep into his high school existence would even care about being popular with those jerk jocks who shunned him all those years. Now gaining cred so he could get with those hot cheerleaders is another story! lol But he knew full well that this popularity couldn't and wouldn't last past high school anyway. And did Cindy's ""friends"" really believe that Ron would dare dump the most popular girl in high school? They really couldn't see through their gimmick?But the main premise of the film is what really bothered me. The premise of this film is just so flimsy and it doesn't hold up compared to many other great 80s comedies. The fact that Ron had to pay this girl $1000 to be seen with him is disturbing. But what really gets me is the big secret gets exposed, somehow Ronald is the school pariah, but the girl who took his money is still very much popular. Uh, you took money to be his girlfriend, lady. How are you somehow less pathetic than he is? Also, this loser geek manages to snow an entire school into thinking he's actually cool and somehow HE is the only one who is dense in this situation? In reality, this guy would be an absolute legend in the annals of the school's history for pulling off this stunt, not scoffed at. Ken even said it to the group of geeks that Ron actually had a good couple of months of being the most popular kid in school which is something those guys could only dream of having. And although I really did like the individual performances of Dempsey and Peterson, I didn't really buy the love story at all. It seemed too clean and cliche that Cindy realized she loved Ron after only being together for a hot minute. And then somehow he loved her even after he completely dismissed her to be with all those other popular cheerleaders. The post fallout scenes really felt disingenuous to me just to have a happy ending.Another thing, why did Cindy still remain friends with her popular clique if she had suddenly ""awakened""? Maybe it was the acting, or lack thereof, but not once did I feel like any of them became different or better people that would make Cindy stay friends with them. They only liked Cindy because she was popular, then only liked Ron because of some fake relationship with Cindy, and as soon as Cindy outed him, they dumped him like yesterday's newspaper. Also, Cindy staying friends with them and never showing an inclination to be friends with any of Ron's clique or less popular kids says a lot about her character. Basically, she did want the popularity and all that comes with it, but at the same time when she fell for Ron, she only really wanted his full attention minus the hard part of integrating herself with his group of friends. I felt like her character was a bunch of talk and very little action. This romance just didn't hit the right marks for me.When I was younger, I probably did root for Ron and Cindy, but on re-watch, I found myself caring most about Ron and Ken's relationship and the resolution to that. First, their arcade scene interaction was very raw and heartbreaking. Then in the movie's best scene, Ron stands up to one of those jocks who threatens Ken and this powerful moment pretty much mends their broken relationship. I felt more realism in the dissolution and resolution of the friendship than I did in the cliche happy romantic ending. Another thing I really enjoyed in this movie is Dempsey's energy and physicality. He had a unique ability to use his body to display emotion and this physical comedy was ever present in all the movies he did in the 80s through the 90s before he decided to tone it down to become a more ""serious"" actor. Probably an unpopular opinion, but this is not my favorite ""Patrick Dempsey as a nerd"" flick. I'll take the fluffy Loverboy or the energetic Run over this not so timeless comedy."

What you would expect from a 'scripted' story with undertones.It is based around modern day society, anger, change, compassion, robotic life styles, power, understanding, toxicity, past vs present vs future.To wrap up. It is very funny until its not. It has some what of a 'suit & tie' feel to it, as it settles down into the home run.Many familiar faces in it.

tt18394190,6.0,"I suspect this film will get some bad reviews, particularly if you aren't familiar with Bill Burr's stand up or you find his style of comedy a bit much (Michael McIntyre he's not). Personally I'm a big fan of Bill and the character he plays in this film is pretty much the one you get in his stand up shows.The movie was written by Bill and that's evident straight from the start with the dialogue very much in his style and in line with his stand up contains several amusing scenes with middle aged men trying to understand the world of woke. However I felt the film lost some pacing and ran out of steam a little in the second half, as Bill's character makes the transition into something more acceptable to modern society.Worth a watch if you like Bill. If you don't then maybe not."
tt18394190,6.0,"Old Dads is at its best when it's closest to Bill Burr's stand up. A mixture of him just complaining about everything and his fear of passing his untamed anger onto his children. It struggles a lot more when it turns those complaints into people and is very rushed in its resolution but remains a fun watch overall.Bill Burr himself is a good lead, funny yet flawed with some pretty vulnerable moments. Bokeem Woodbine works really well as the calmest of the three and Bobby Cannavale is so entertaining in this completely over the top performance. He's obsessed with being seen as cool and it leads to some of the best moments.Bill Burr's direction is fine. As a debut there's always added pressure to bring something extra to announce yourself and whilst Burr doesn't do that it remains technically competent and his writing and performance combined make up for the journeyman filmmaking on display."
tt2557478,5.0,"A sequel to a movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters. What was expected? Bigger robots fighting bigger monsters. The same thing with little tweaks - as most sequels do. What we got?
A product. A film generated by an AI. I wasn't there, but I assume it went something like this. The first meeting of the creators of this movie follows.
Ok, Google, what do modern kids like?
1. Robots (Transformers)
2. Scary cool monsters
3. Robots fighting monsters
4. Robots fighting robots
5. Memes from 2009 (Trololo sing) really? + memes from 2017 (the salt). 
6. Horribly executed kid rebel subplots (Divergent, The Maze Runner, The Hunger games whatever)
7. Action
8. Forced drama?
9. Bad jokes?
Ok, let's take The Independence Day Resurgence's basic plot and fail miserably at everything. Done.
In other words, there is nothing in this movie besides action scenes. The plot lives on its own, there are no characters, and even their substitutes are completely disconnected from the dead plot. Nothing they do matter, it just follows typical cliches until the end. It even gets confusing at some point, but then you see the light at the end of the tunnel. It rushes the ending knowing that by this point nobody cares.
All the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Most of the actors are just having fun knowing that there's no need to get invested into anything here. Sadly, Scott Eastwood's face is stuck in one emotion and is unable to display anything else.
CGI crews did a good job, I guess. Looks fine. There's even one creative action scene involving buildings. Other than that the action is generic, even IMAX can't make it feel better. Maybe it would've been more impressive but the overabundance of CGI city destruction in modern blockbusters seriously lowers the threshold for getting impressed by CGI.
I'd compare this to a long video game cut-scene, but modern games have more character development and creative visuals in their cut-scenes. For instance, pretty much all Blizzard cut-scenes are visual masterpieces. 
Final verdict: not entertaining on the big screen and a total waste of time for home viewing."
tt2557478,6.0,"Although I did enjoy this movie, and it was a joy to watch on the big screen, the overall tone, and mood are so different from the first. The difference between fight scenes at night vs broad daylight may not seem like a big deal, but for some reason it really stood out to me. It just feels like this one was more geared toward kids, and potentially selling action figures. I didn't hate it by any means, but it really lacked what made the first one so unique, and intriguing to me."
tt2557478,5.0,"Mind-numbing nonsense from fade-in to fadeout, ""Pacific Rim Uprising"" lacks the stellar cast and the suspenseful Armageddon melodrama of its outlandish but entertaining predecessor. Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost and Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket made ""Pacific Rim"" more than just a juvenile diversion in collateral damage and urban renewal. Comparatively, neither John Boyega nor Scott Eastwood musters enough magnetism in ""Pacific Rim Uprising"" to overshadow our heroic memories of Stacker and Raleigh. Everybody knows Stacker died in the original, so he was never coming back. Becket's absence is never adequately explained, though he might reappear in a later sequel. Meantime, ""Pacific Rim Uprising"" violates the first rule of all good sequels. Never should a heretofore untold character related to a franchise hero be invented to replace him. Meantime, everybody should recognize Boyega from his two recent ""Star Wars"" spectacles, while Clint Eastwood's son Scott has acquitted himself more than satisfactorily with supporting roles in ""Fury"" and ""Suicide Squad."" Boyega and Eastwood represent Hollywood's new blood. Sadly, they are hamstrung playing superficial characters with scarcely any complexity or charisma. The same shortcoming applies to the new breed of Jaeger pilots who comprise a politically-correct, multi-cultural coalition. Unknown actors and actresses all, they constitute a bland bunch with their petty rivalries. Boyega and Eastwood must whip these recruits into shape, so they can maneuver skyscraper-sized Jaegers on a dime. ""Pacific Rim"" came out in 2013, and five years would slip away before ""Pacific Rim Uprising"" emerged. Despite the gap in time between the original's release and its uninspired sequel, you'd think the filmmakers could have conjured up something with more imagination than a lame imitation of ""Ender's Game"" (2013). Basically, all director Steven S. DeKnight of Netflix's ""Daredevil,"" freshman scenarists Emily Carmichael and Kira Snyder, and ""Maze Runner"" writer T.S. Nowlin do is grant the Kaiju a rematch. Along the way, they disperse the returning original characters, and the last-minute showdown never attains the impressive proportions of ""Pacific Rim."" This formulaic follow-up takes place in 2030, ten years after the Kaiju defeat at the Battle of the Breach. Not only has peace and prosperity been restored during the intervening decade, but scientists have also converted the rock 'em, sock 'em Jaegers so they can be deployed like drones. DeKnight and his writers introduce Stacker Pentecost's insubordinate son, Jake (John Boyega of ""Attack the Block""), but the son is nothing like his sire. Since the end of the Kaiju wars, dismantled Jaegers have been rusting away in scrap heaps. Some skeptics insist on being prepared for the return of the Kaiju. Thieves have catered to their paranoia by stealing Jaeger parts and selling them to these superstitious souls. Jake acquires his cash from pilfering these parts. Little does he know his principal competitor is an audacious, 15-year old orphan, Amara Namani (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), and she is beating him to those parts. Amara is assembling her own micro-sized Jaeger when Jake catches up with her. No sooner have they met than a real Jaeger thwarts her plans. Cutting a deal, Jake winds up back where he started before the Kaiju wars instead of behind bars. Former Jaeger copilot and old friend Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood of ""Diablo"") needs Jake to help train the new Jaegar pilots. Instead of calling it ""Pacific Rim Uprising,"" producer Guillermo del Toro and DeKnight should have named it ""Pacific Rim: The Next Generation."" Since she proved herself a decent pilot, Namani lands in the new cadet class, but not everyone likes her. According to Lambert, teens make better Jaeger pilots. Their youth, it seems, enables them 'to drift' better as co-pilots. If you haven't seen ""Pacific Rim,"" the mind-melding ability to drift is indispensable for pilots to operate these gigantic robots in combat against the supernatural ""Godzilla"" lizards from another dimension. Drifting might also apply to the audiences' willing suspension of disbelief in matters of such caprice.Meantime, Dr. Hermann Gottieb (Burn Gorman) and Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day), who enlivened the original with their feverish comic relief antics, are no longer friendly. Newt now works for the domineering Liwen Shao (Jing Tian of ""The Great Wall"") of the Shao Corporation, where he serves as her co-chief of the drone development program. The change in the relationship between Hermann and Newt provides the sole surprise in this mediocre sequel. Remember, these two nerds saved the day for Stacker and Raleigh in ""Pacific Rim"" because they drifted with a hideous Kaiju's mind. Hermann still suffers nightmares from the ordeal, while nitwit Newt has discovered the love of his life. Yes, he keeps a Kaiju brain preserved in a glass tank at his apartment, refers to her as Alice, and maintains what might be described as a Platonic relationship with it! Preposterous as this all seems, it might have been less bizarre if the filmmakers had brought back Ron Perlman's sinister Kaiju collector Hannibal Chau from the first film whose presence is sorely missed. Newt's infatuation with Alice, and the profit-motive resolve of Liwen Shao to implement drones over drift pilots makes her seem shady when a rogue Jaeger storms out of the ocean and annihilates Sidney, Australia. Apart from Hermann and Newt, the only other returning ""Pacific Rim"" character is Rinko Kikuchi's Mako Mori. Sadly, Mako has been demoted from piloting Jaegers and is sidelined to the status of a pencil-pushing administrator. Mako must approve Shao's drone pilot proposal before the Pan Pacific Defense Corps (PPDC) will institute it. Meaning, Mori doesn't survive long enough to make a difference. Predictably, the fearsome alien Kaiju monsters arrive in the second hour to challenge the green Jaeger recruits. DeKnight orchestrates this last minute apocalyptic battle in Tokyo, with the usual collateral damage, while ""Terminator Genisys"" composer Lorne Balfe's bombastic score does more to heighten this slam-bang smackdown than its staging. Not even an intriguing cliffhanger ending is enough to make ""Pacific Rim Uprising"" seem more than a 'downsizing' of its far superior predecessor."

I'm thankful for this as I'm tired of the senseless reboots, seriously enough already.With a fantastic cast who are all bringing their A game Jumanji is a very generic Hollywood movie. What I mean by that is its predictible, it's flashy, it's loud and has all the usual tropes that you'd expect.Don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's entirely a bad thing, at least it has fantastic production values but sadly it means it lacks in originality and has no real identity of it's own.Telling the story of 4 teenagers who get pulled into Jumanji, yet this time it's updated and has become a video game!Plenty of comedy, both hit and miss, the stunning Miss Gillan on show and Jack Black for the first time in years actually reminding us why we used to love him.It goes without saying that I prefer the first movie but credit where credit is due Welcome To The Jungle did exceed my expectations as I think I subconciously went in expecting and perhaps wanting to hate it.Nothing special, all flash with little filler.

tt0113540,6.0,"This film struck me in the heart, it made me feel terrible after seeing it and any movie that can have a impact on me like that, I congragulate. The film is almost like a documentary of a group of kids in NYC. It probably isn't completely realistic but its believable. It is a frightening wake up call to America.If you want to be moved watch this film. The acting is great for a group of rag-tag kids, they make the story really believable and passionate. I do believe that Larry Clark has a strage obsession with teenage nudity, in every film I've seen of his there has been tons of teenagers having sex, sometimes it spoils the film.Overall the film is powerful and moving, watch it."
tt0113540,6.0,"This is a scary movie. Sure it's been dramatized, but it will haunt you long after viewing. Why? You'll first reaction might be 'Well this is only a movie. There aren't kids around like that. I wasn't like that.' That is what's truly sad. It's some cold honest truth. The world can be a dark place. There ARE kids like this. If you look around you can see them. It's become all too common.Aptly the filmmakers chose the title for the film to be ""Kids"". It seems wrong and yet so right. The characters in this movie aren't age-wise, but at the same time they're haven't matured, haven't learnt from their mistakes... and in this tale, some won't have a chance. What am I talking about? AIDS.Now I believe Kids is more than just a pro-safe sex movie, but what you take away from it is up to you. Everyone has an opinion on why kids grow up like this so I won't subject you to my opinion. As for it being exploitative, I'm kind of torn. On one hand, it deals with very dark subject matter. The filmmakers have tried and for the most part succeeded in telling a tale of growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, so to speak. At the same time though, they could have dealt with the proceedings a little more sensitively. For instance, it would have been even more shocking if the filmmakers hadn't resorted to long drawn out scenes of simulated sex that were supposed to be horrifying but weren't.At the end of the day, Kids showcases a nasty glimpse into a generation hellbent on making mistakes and growing up too fast. As a film, it could have used some more work in areas, but it's upfront brutal tone and harsh message remains clear to the end."
tt0113540,5.0,"Some films are just not some people's cup of tea. ""Barney's Big Adventure"" for example. And then there are some movies that certain people should not watch. ""Kids"" is one of those films. It's is shocking, unblinking and terribly disturbing. And to be honest, I bet it is still tame compared to some of the things teens are doing today. Still, I think this film is an accurate representation of the ""idiot"" culture that is thriving in America. These kids have no morals, no innocence, and no conscience. They make stupid decisions, manipulate anyone they can, and lash out when they feel there is no other option. It was the darkest and most creepy film I ever saw until ""Happiness"" came out. Two real quick points in response to previous posters. There are kids out there like this, and not just in the big city. I think anywhere that parents have passed the buck, this behavior can happen. Finally, someone wrote they couldn't believe Leo Fitzpatrick as the Romeo getting all the girls. Trust me, I have seen boys more goofy looking than him who seem to attract the prettiest and sweetest young girls. The point of his whole character is his sweet talking charm lures these girls in. It may be the most disturbing thing in the whole film, in fact......."
tt0113540,6.0,"Send these kids to camp -- fast! Or do SOMETHING. Wow, what a life. Basically this is a picture of the life kids who occupy a certain social space lead during their summer vacations. It jumps from episode to episode with a few continuing characters, including Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson.To the extent that there is a story at all, it is this. The movie opens with the teen aged Leo Fitzpatrick successfully seducing the teen aged Chloe Sevigny, who is a virgin. Shortly afterward Sevigny is told she tested positive for HIV, meaning that Fitzpatrick is an asymptomatic carrier. Sevigny spends the rest of the movie looking for Fitzpatrick to tell him about it and prevent him from infecting anyone else. She is waylaid by encounters with strange teenagers, although to be sure they are all strange, and when she finally locates Fitzpatrick at a raucous party he is already putting the blocks to yet another virgin. Sevigny closes the door and staggers away to crash on the couch. Later that night, another creepy teenager wakes up, wanders about, notices the unconscious Sevigny, and does her in what appears to be two different ways. So much for AIDS.That's the thread the movie hangs on, but it serves not as a point in itself but as an illustration of the absence of any point. The kids do everything that ordinary people would consider revolting. They begin using dope the minute they wake up. They shoplift clumsily. They pee on walls in public places. They get drunk. They vomit. They fornicate at will. They don't work. They litter freely. They swear constantly. They ogle each other's mother's breasts. They get into fist fights on the slightest of pretexts. They recognize no checks on their appetites. We hardly see any adults and the ones we do see aren't necessarily much better -- an overweight and ill-groomed mother smoking while she nurses an infant.It's all distasteful but you can't really disengage yourself from what's happening on the screen. It would be like looking away from a gory traffic accident.Maybe that's a problem, too, because the film is so impregnated with debauchery that after a while it becomes frankly unbelievable. One DAY of this kind of life would stun an elephant. More than that, it's too much of a bad thing. Not a single kid we see has any redeeming qualities whatever, except for two virgins who yield readily enough to Fitzpatrick's snake oil. And for all the vulgarity and all the violence done to our ideas of good taste, I'm not sure that the film makers have really gotten it all down accurately.I'll just give two examples in which a viewer might become conscious of the effort it takes to suspend disbelief. (1) In a drug dealer's apartment (where kids who look about nine years old are doing dope) the music from the boombox is what sounds like John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. I don't think so. I hate to buy into stereotypes too easily, but what I expect to hear is not demanding, classical jazz but hip hop. (2) In Central Park during a drug score, an exojuvenile intrudes on the gang and takes offense at some remark about a skateboard. The alien is a black guy. The gang of dopers who are buddies are racially mixed. They all gang up on the stranger and beat hell out of him, ending it with a possibly lethal whack full in the face with the skateboard. It doesn't jibe with experience. I have a feeling that the fist fight would gradually divide the group along racial lines.This is a heck of a movie. Man, the kids should bottle that energy. They'd be on the Big Board in no time. It could be found in cans in Quick-Stop reefers. ADENORUSH -- for that ""scootch"" feeling. But it's too spelled out. There isn't a moment's rest. I'm not talking about sitting down to ponder Marcus Aurelius. I mean just shutting up for a few minutes. The final shot may be symptomatic. Dawn is crashing around the sleeping, benumbed and benighted bodies the morning after a party. During the night the place has been thoroughly trashed and two girls have probably now caught HIV from our index case. One body, still holding a bottle, stirs a little and comes to life. Its eyes open. It stares blearily into the camera lens and wonders aloud, ""What happened?"" In ""The 400 Blows,"" 45 years earlier, Truffaut made the same point simply by ending on a freeze frame of the delinquent kid caught on the run, staring fixedly and silently at the camera. ""Kids"" suggests that at the end the director doesn't trust us enough to have gotten the point, although we've been hit over the head with it for an hour and a half."
tt0092890,6.0,"Growing up there was a movie I loved. Star Wars. I wanted to be Han Solo, I wanted the X-Wings and lightsaber. I wanted to live a dream. A little while later I became vaguely aware of something called girls. Now that I've learned to talk to them without pulling their hair and running away (generally) I've discovered that for many of them the reverence I hold for Star Wars they hold for Dirty Dancing. Why? I'll come back to that later.Dirty Dancing is a simple movie. Baby (Jennifer Grey) and her family go to an upper middle class holiday resort for the summer. She is only seventeen, naive and something of a Daddy's girl (Her nickname is Baby, this is not a subtle movie). Once we reach the resort we realise that amongst the staff there is a very distinct class system at work. It is acceptable, even encouraged that the waiters 'show the daughters a good time' but the dancers, led by Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are to keep well away from them. And why not I ask you, after all, he wears tight fitting t-shirts and a leather jacket. He's a wrong 'un and no mistake. Still, as is the nature of these things Baby and Johnny are thrust together due to circumstance, and decide to continue thrusting together due to them both being attractive and young. He teaches her how to dance and she teaches him that he can be anything he wants to be. Unfortunately their love is a forbidden love and Baby's father, Dr. Jake Houseman (Jerry Orbach), cannot see past Johnny's working class roots, assuming that he is the one who got his own dancing partner pregnant. Of course it wasn't, it was that no good, rich waiter who is now making moves on Baby's sister! Still, Baby continues to see Johnny, this is after all true love, but of course they are eventually discovered, Johnny is sacked and Baby is miserable. Luckily her father knows she'll get over it. However, Dr. Houseman had not counted on the big finish. Inspired by Baby's belief in both himself and her ideology in general, Johnny returns to the resort and dances the last dance of the season with Baby in front of all the guests. The evil waiter is discovered, Dr. Houseman accepts Johnny, and the classes are united through the medium of dance. Huzzah! The performances here are absolutely fine. Grey is suitably cute and sunshine-filled, and it is actually hard to believe that she is ten years older than her character is supposed to be. Swayze looks fantastic and I can absolutely see why every girl I knew growing up wanted to be Baby. Orbach is suitably fatherly, giving what is actually a very subtle and real performance. Many parts of the story are contrived, but if you are going to believe that the boy from the wrong side of the tracks and daddy's princess are going to end up together in the end, I think we can accept that.Like many people I really enjoy the soundtrack to this movie. Mixing fantastic early 60s rock'n'roll with mid-80s ballads it starts your toes tapping straight from the start and doesn't give up until the very end. Then of course there is the dancing. I remember at the tender age of nine being at a friends house and having a feeling of pure horror when it was suggested that I be Johnny while she danced as Baby to 'I Had The Time Of My Life'. For a start I didn't think I had a hope in pulling off the lift. I mean, we had never even set foot in a handy, nearby lake.So, back to my original question. Why is this movie so popular, especially with women? Apart from the fact that Baby has a pretty amazing life, I think it is because she is the knight in shining armour. In Star Wars Princess Leia is no slouch but lets be honest, it's up to Luke and Han to rescue her. In Dirty Dancing it is the princess who rescues the lovable rogue. There is no need for a blaster or a lightsaber, here she is able to do it through simply believing in other people and believing in love.This movie will never mean as much to me as Star Wars or Indiana Jones, but I don't think it's awful, I don't even think it's bad. In fact I think it's quite good. It is an unpretentious, feel-good romance movie. I may not have had the time of my life, but it was certainly a pleasant enough hour and a half."

tt14209916,5.0,"Cocaine Bear promised so much but just didn't hit the spot for me.There are too many characters in my opinion which becomes a bit of a chore and breaks things up a little too much. If there was more of a focus on just a couple of characters as the protagonists it would have been better.The humour didn't always work for me. Sometimes it was good but it fell flat a little too often.The central premise is great but it doesn't go far enough in my opinion. I feel like there was a lot more fun to have with the concept. Although saying that there are some wildly fun and gruesome body horror moments, and the effects on the bear and the injury detail are top notch.Overall a bit of a let down. This film is mostly fun as expected, but the premise wears a little thin come the third act. Not quite the riotous spectacle I was hoping for."
tt14209916,6.0,"Cocaine Bear offers little beyond the trailers in terms of originality, flashiness, or cleverness, but it does offer more of the same...and a lot of it. Chances are, however you interpret the trailers and however you feel about them will determine how you enjoy this movie. If you're ready for a leave-your-brain-at-home 80's adventure of slasher gore (sans human antagonist) and some corny punchlines, then this is your ticket. I would be lying if I said I did not have the occasional chuckle, and truth be told, some of SFX company Weta's bear animations were uncomfortably realistic at times. Ultimately though, I found myself several times throughout the brisk 95 minute runtime wishing the film would tingle my brain with abstractions that never came.My advice? If you like the trailer, see it in theaters. If you were indifferent about the trailer, wait until it hits streaming."
tt14209916,5.0,"'Cocaine Bear' does exactly what it says on the box - it's a film about a black bear in Georgia, USA, that gets high from some cocaine dumped in the forest and goes on a rampage. Very loosely based on a true story, where illegal drugs actually were thrown out of a plane and killed a bear. Needless to say, the bear is CGI. The cast is surprisingly strong, with the main cast of 'The Americans' present - Russell, Rhys & Martindale - along with Ehrenreich (from 'Solo'), Jackson Jr (from 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'), Whitlock Jr (from heaps of stuff) & Ray Liotta's final ever role.Even though it has funny parts, there's probably not enough consistently funny jokes or moments to be a true comedy. Likewise with the horror/thriller aspect - there's some scary moments, but nothing sustained or truly horrific. A bit of gore and I think the death tally reached 9 in the end, but probably needed to be a few more to reach actual horror territory.It's basically a creature feature, and I'd put it alongside 'The Meg' and 'Piranha 3D', rather than 'Jaws' or 'King Kong'. The cast are all likeable, but their skills are severely underutilised. The score is good and some of the shots of the Chattahoochee forest are nice. The ending is a bit underwhelming with too much family drama."

A bear sniffing cocaine the whole movie.Last, I am not going to spoil anything saying the premise was crazier than the execution, because the really weak script. It could have been a masterpiece, but instead you got an over the average gory crazy bear feast.To add, this was the last Ray Liota's movie, so respect for him."

If you expect too much ...then you may be disappointed, but I don't think anyone who is going to see this film is expecting an Oscar-worthy meaningful masterpiece. Yeah, I guess the movie could have been better (definitely not a 10-star film), but compared to other things in this category; I think it's above average and effort was made to produce something entertaining.I predict the ""Cocaine Bear"" films will become quite a successful franchise.

What a waste of an incredible talent!The film would have been a lot better if it focused on her and the kids instead of following Keri Russell's blandly forgettable nurse around, not to mention the crooks whose entire story-arc felt wholly unnecessary.5/10 Stars.

tt0118880,6.0,"`Con Air' more or less defines the term `popcorn movie'  it's an action film designed strictly to entertain.  The film's emphasis is on flash, flair, and adrenaline, with a smattering of humor and story spread throughout for good measure.  Not exactly the most lofty of goals, but the desire to entertain is quite sincere, and `Con Air' does largely succeed in the entertainment department.Where `Con Air' falls apart, however, is the grandiose, grandstanding way in which it tells its story.  Subtlety is a word that is impossible to use in describing this film.  `Con Air' is a firm believer in the concept that more must be better  ten explosions must be better than one; three psychotic villains must be better than two; and so on.  The `bigger is better' approach never truly turns the film into an utter mess, but it does bog it down to a certain extent  what could've been a fantastic action movie becomes, well, just better than average.  A leaner and meaner `Con Air' could've been a classic.`Con Air' is the story of good-guy Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), an Army Ranger unjustly tossed in prison for eight long years for protecting his family from a drunken, knife-wielding maniac. Finally paroled, Poe is placed on a converted troop transport plane that will take him home to his family. However, also on board the plane is a roster of psychotic criminals vaguely reminiscent of the Legion of Doom from the old `Superfriends' cartoon. There's Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich), an articulate, thoughtful madman with a penchant for automatic weapons; Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), a black militant and Cyrus' trusted lieutenant (or so Cyrus thinks, at any rate); Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo), a serial rapist; Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), a serial killer in the Hannibal Lecter vein who is treated as the resident prison celebrity; and a good half-dozen other colorful characters to flesh out this flying rogues' gallery of nightmare criminals.  Under Cyrus' direction, the criminals take control of the plane, and it's up to the beleaguered Poe to save the day, with some help from good-guy U.S. Marshal Larkin (John Cusack) on the ground, who's seemingly the only person in U.S. law enforcement capable of deciphering Poe's brief and cryptic messages to the authorities.The film moves along at a brisk pace, cheerfully glossing over its own improbabilities.  `Con Air' is definitely the kind of film that only works if you don't stop to think about it, and director Simon West keeps things going quick enough to keep most of the ludicrous plot holes mercifully brief.  He manages to cut from one story arc to another with a certain amount of skill, keeping each arc from completely snowballing into something unmanageable.  However, the juggling act wears thin by the end of the movie  there's simply too much to try to balance.  It's not particularly Simon West's fault (although he does have an annoying penchant for overusing the slow-motion explosion filmed from five different angles, a lá `The A-Team'), but more a by-product of the script. The second half of the film has forced moments, where the only purpose of the action scenes seems to be to completely outdo the action scenes in the first half.  These scenes are undeniably cool looking, but they're filler, and filler can only take a movie so far.  A good third of the film  story, action scenes, you name it  could've easily been excised from the film, and not only would it never be missed, `Con Air' would actually be vastly improved.
Even the characters, while entertaining, wind up just overwhelming the film. The villain Diamond Dog, as played by Ving Rhames, is charismatic, menacing, and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . and he's also completely gratuitous.  As Cyrus the Virus, John Malkovich is also charismatic, menacing, and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . just like Diamond Dog. The movie simply doesn't have room for both villains (and it definitely doesn't have room for the Lecter-inspired Garland Green, who Steve Buscemi turns into an odd sort of comic relief, but otherwise serves no purpose in the film.)  ONE villain would've been plenty.  Ditto the heroes: Cage is good, Cusack is good, but c'mon, pick ONE.  Like the rest of the film, the characters become too much, and wind up becoming pure overkill.In many ways, `Con Air' looks like the results of a Hollywood brainstorming meeting gone haywire, where a thousand ideas are slapped down onto a notepad. . . but these ideas don't necessarily mesh well together.  Most of the ideas in `Con Air' are surprisingly decent, there's just too many of them. (How many times have you heard that about an action movie?)Overall, `Con Air' is okay, and if you're in the mood for fun, mindless action, it gets the job done.  Personally, I'd recommend watching `The Rock' instead it's by far the best of the recent spate of Bruckheimer action flicks  but  `Con Air', for all its excesses, has its own good moments, too.  Grade: B-"
tt0237572,5.0,"Jack Nicholson is a retired cop whose last minutes on the job are ruined by the discovery of the mutilated and raped body of a little girl. A retarded Indian (Benicio del Toro) is picked up for the crime. Del Toro has a record of child abuse and other offenses, some physical evidence linking him to the girl is found in the cab of his truck, an eyewitness places him at the scene of the killing, and under coaxing he confesses. Then he grabs a gun and shoots himself. The horrified Nicholson doesn't believe the confession and thinks Del Toro was innocent. He pledges to the dead girl's parents that he'll find the killer. Nicholson settles into an old café. Soon a beautiful younger woman (Robin Wright Penn) and her daughter move in with him and they become a family. The problem is that Penn's daughter is a beautiful eight-year-old girl child who reminds Nicholson of the murder victim. He goes to such unusual lengths to protect her from the killer he believes to be still at large and operating in the vicinity that he alienates his friends on the police force and drives Penn and her daughter away. He uses the girl as bait to trap the rapist who, the film suggests, was killed in a highway accident while hurrying to meet and harm the girl. Of course, no one realizes that the charred corpse in the burning car is the rapist, and that Nicholson's anxiety was justified. The last scene has a half-mad, fainéant Nicholson sitting in the dust in front of his now-dilapidated and ruined café, drunk, gesticulating wildly and talking to himself -- a lone and tragic figure in the wind.I was unable to figure out what all the fuss was about. I don't mind tragedies but they have to develop out of something, don't they? Nicholson promises to catch the killer/rapist. He does what he can, even at the risk of his own family, and he appears to succeed, though he doesn't know it, and it costs him everything he has. Where is his tragic flaw? His downfall, like the car accident that kills the rapist, seems entirely arbitrary. It doesn't flow out of anything that has preceded it. Okay, let Nicholson fall, but give us a reason for it, some hamartia -- Othello's jealousy or Caesar's ambition -- even on a small scale. But what do we carry away from this film? Don't make promises you can't keep? Sometimes a film can get away with this kind of diffuse narrative if it's handled stylishly. (I still have to concentrate in order to figure out the plot of ""Chinatown."") But this isn't handled with any kind of artistry. The director, Sean Penn, sets the story in and around Reno but we get no sense of place. Reno is a raffish, vulgar little city. The surroundings, the Great Basin Desert and the Sierra Nevada, are raw and majestic. But, aside from a few shots of Nicholson fishing, we don't get much of an impression of it. I'm not asking for pretty postcards, just some atmosphere.Nicholson gives a performance that is slow and stiff or, let's say, thoughtful, but mostly he's Jake Gittes with a hangover. Robin Wright Penn is more animated, perhaps the liveliest person in the movie, and she's just about the right age. The little girl is enchanting, like a painting of a beautiful child, and she seems like a natural actress. Other actors of note have small roles that don't add much. But Benicio Del Toro is great as the barely interpretable Indian, his face mostly hidden by a voluminous witch-like growth of hair.Penn seems to love close ups. There are a plenitude of close up. Not just close ups of faces, but close ups of eyes and close ups of noses and close ups of ornaments dangling from rear-view mirrors. There's a close up of a hook being removed from a trout's mouth. Is ""claustrophobia"" supposed to be a THEME of some sort? The motivations are weak as well. What is it that convinces Nicholson's cop that Del Toro is innocent? And why does Nicholson so stupidly swear on a home-made cross, ""pledge your soul's salvation"", that he will catch the killer? When Nicholson learns from the little girl that she has made a date with the ""wizard"" who gives her bon-bons, he lets her bicycle to the picnic site, and then surrounds it with policemen, including a SWAT team. At no time is she in any danger. So why does this drive Robin Wright Penn into hysterics so that she beats Nicholson, clutches her wailing daughter, and leaves him flat? Why doesn't she just heap her calumny upon him. Or make him take ANOTHER pledge on a home-made cross that he'll never do it again.The film is sluggish and unenlightening. The story remains an interesting promise, unfulfilled."
tt0237572,6.0,"My summary is NOT because I disliked ""The Pledge"". However, two things about the movie make it very tough viewing. The story is about a sicko who rapes and murders children. This is NOT an easy thing to watch. Additionally, there is an absolutely horrific scene...and my wife bailed on the movie following it...and she's not especially squeamish. You see what looks very real as a man shoots himself in the head...blood and all! Be forewarned...this is not an easy picture.Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is a police chief who is retiring. His final case involves the rape and murder of a second grader...and he takes the parents anguish to heart and pledges to find the killer. Although he's now retired, he spends his retirement searching for the person responsible...and it appears as if they've killed several times already.There is much more to the story than this and the bulk of the film is Black post-retirement...and his life and the plot unfolds very slowly and lovingly. You really like the guy and care for those around him. And, that brings me to a disappointing thing about the picture. I really loved it to this point (despite the suicide and the squicky plot)...the finale really felt unsatisfying and vague. The reasons for this are in the IMDB trivia...the studio ran out of money! This also might make it tough to watch...or at least frustrating. It's a real shame, as I really, really liked the performances and the actors deserved better."
tt0237572,6.0,"Spoilers herein.The basics: Penn is the next Woody Allen, but more adept and more visceral. His own understanding of acting attracts some top flight talent, and here they are all as good as it gets. Even Micky Rourke is powerful! Nicholson starts a new career. Making a film is all about abstraction, and since it is a collective art, managing all the abstractions so that a single vision projects. The odder the vision, the more worthwhile, and the harder to corral. This man ruthlessly exploits everything that streams at us (including the music -- so apt). Del Toro is worth mentioning because he is currently in two other films of merit. But the cinematic flash there is all in support of either nothing (Snatch) or thin narrative support for a relatively vapid insight (Traffic). Here, not only is Del Toro amazingly real, but the whole film delivers powerful dramatic effect integrated with narrative, unlike the other two which are mostly dance.The IMDB comments posted before this are largely negative, and I speculate these are from younger folk -- further that the audience Pledge grabs in the gut will be among more experienced souls. The ending is great, the biggest emotional cliff since `Limbo.'But all that is just surface stuff -- a man pledging his soul and losing it when the bargain is usatisfiable. The really interesting thing is the ambiguity of the narrative. We know Penn is concerned with this issue -- really hot among thinking directors for the past couple years. Here he (and the original book) play Nabokov -- the pacing of the film resembles a madman's reminiscences. Yes, there are too many coincidences in the story. Yes it is framed by a mad drunk's mumblings. Yes, the camera deliberately takes non-contemporary human viewer perspectives. Yes, there are discontinuities. Yes, the `Lolita' references were many and obvious.What we have here folks is a multilayered weaving of reality and imagination. We saw Penn act at these two levels simultaneously in Woody's `Sweet and Lowdown.' Now he coaches buddy Jack (who has more to give and more to lose) into a more nuanced dual-level performance. This will endure when `Snatch' is long gone.This is the first 10 I give in 12 months of theater releases. That's about 100 films."
tt0111282,6.0,"Stargate starts in 1928 in Giza where an archaeological dig uncovers an alien Stargate used to travel between worlds. Jump forward to the 'Present Day' where Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has radical theories that the Pyramids weren't constructed by the Egyptians, he is contacted by Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) & given the opportunity to prove his theories. Langford takes Jackson to an underground Military facility where no-one has been able to work out how to operate the mysterious Stargate, within a couple of weeks Jackson has it all figured out. A mission is undertaken to travel through the Stargate to a distant planet & investigate the alien world on the other side...This French American co-production was co-written & directed by Roland Emmerich & is a fine sci-fi adventure film that holds up very well even when viewed today nearly fifteen years after it was made which is a feat in itself since a lot of sci-fi dates badly very quickly. Originally the rough cut for Stargate was apparently three hours long, it was eventually released into theatres at two hours long & has subsequently been released in a 'Director's Cut' that adds about ten more minutes to the theatrical cut, having said that I will be basing my comments on the original two hour theatrical version. The script by Emmerich & producer Dean Devlin bases itself on the idea that an alien visited Earth & formed our society & Egypt is a reflection of those aliens, it's a reasonable idea although since the alien planet looks like a desert with Egyptian Pyramids & human beings as it's inhabitants it sometimes feels like Stargate is set on Earth rather than some distant planet on the edge of the known Universe. The story starts off intriguing enough & it's a very watchable & overall enjoyable film but at two hours in length it does drag at times & I wasn't keen on the rebellious slave uprising at the end, it just felt rather clichéd & predictable. The character's are alright & it's refreshing to see an alien planet where the aliens don't speak English, while this maybe authentic you can see why most sci-fi films don't go down this route since lots of alien dialogue without knowing what they are saying does tend to get a bit tedious, I certainly wouldn't want to watch many films where half the dialogue spoken is quite literally alien although having said that towards the end the dialogue starts to be subtitled.Director Emmerich is no stranger to the big budget special effects laden blockbuster & would go on to make films such as Independence Day (1992), Godzilla (1998) & The Day After Tomrrow (2004). Stargate was his second 'big' film after the rather good Jean-Claude Van Damme action sci-fi film Universal Solider (1992), Stargate certainly looks nice enough from the bright sunshine of the desert planet to the dark grey interiors of the evil aliens spaceship. The special effects are generally very good, made before a time CGI computer effects were used for everything Stargate has a mixture of CGI, model work & on set effects which all blend together to make for a convincing alien world. The huge Pyramid spaceship in particular looks very impressive. Apparently conceived by Emmerich during film school in 1979 both he & Devlin were sued by someone who alleged they stole the story from him, the case was settled out of court.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Stargate was a well funded film & it show's with a real sense of scope & scale, it also has that polished Hollywood feel although the scene at the end where Daniel & the girl are transported back down into the Pyramid is very poorly edited & it is actually quite difficult to make out what's happening. Apparently filmed in California & Arizona. The acting is good, I have always liked Kurt Russell but don't consider this to be one of his best films as he gives a largely cold & detached performance & only really becomes the action hero for the last fifteen minutes while Spader is likable enough as the geeky hero.Stargate is a good solid sci-fi film that doesn't quite reach the heights of greatness due to it's length, a lot of pointless dialogue scenes with aliens who you can't understand & I didn't really like the constant bland desert setting that much. Followed by the popular American Canadian TV series Stargate SG-1 (1997 - 2007) which ran for ten seasons & two hundred & thirteen episodes which itself spawned another TV series Stargate: Atlantis (2004) which is still running now & the less than popular Stargate: Infinity (2002) which ran for a single solitary season."
tt0111282,5.0,"STARGATE should be the perfect movie for me: an interesting premise, grounded in real-life theory (I've been reading Graham Hancock's FINGERPRINTS OF THE GODS recently, and am familiar with Von Daniken's writings) and made with a high enough budget to do the special effects justice.And watching it, it's hard to fault the production. The performances are pretty good, from Kurt Russell's hard-ass soldier to James Spader's nerdy Egyptologist, and the aforementioned SFX are decent. It's just that the film ends up feeling relatively mundane given the extensive set-up; it all turns into an entirely typical good guys vs. the bad guys type film, with little of the intelligence or thought-provoking questions I was hoping for.I'll lay the blame squarely at the door of Roland Emmerich, who has quite the habit of dumbing down his source material (INDEPENDENCE DAY, GODZILLA, need I go on?). Imagine if this had been made by somebody with more interest in the questions raised instead of the size of the guns!"
tt0111282,6.0,"The rare Roland Emmerich film that isn't brainless, effects-over-story mayhem. Well, not completely, anyway. It does carry a lot of the director's favorite themes, from the tortured genius who only needs the chance to prove himself to the war-hungry soldier on a suicide mission, the overbearing government suits and the eccentric, ignored true believers. Those over-simplifications are glaring, of course, but at least there's an effort put in to expand certain characters beyond their stereotype (Kurt Russell's lingering resentment of guns, for example) and the plot itself is rich and interesting enough to paper over most of the holes. I've always had an affinity for science fiction and Egyptian history, so any merger of the two was bound to hit a sweet spot for me, and in this case the marriage works shockingly well. There's a certain other-worldliness about the pyramids, and that particular culture's system of beliefs, which lends itself well to such genre-driven filmmaking. The practical special effects come off wonderfully - gigantic hovering spacecraft and robotic Anubis-helmed enforcers - but it was still a bit early to rely on CG for this type of work and the few instances where they tried don't hold up very well. Despite a phoned-in leading performance by James Spader, Stargate remains a quirky, unexpectedly engaging ride. Still fresh, unique and interesting as it approaches its twenty-fifth anniversary."
tt11214590,6.0,"There were quite a number of reasons for wanting to see 'House of Gucci'. The advertising did intrigue and did suggest a film that would be over the top but entertaining in its own way. Ridley Scott's filmography is hit and miss, brilliant at his best like with 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' though some of his films, such as 'GI Jane' and 'Robin Hood' ('Legend' is underrated in my view), are not too great. The main draw though was the cast, with Lady Gaga (an immensely gifted performer and inspirational person) being a big selling point for many.For me though, bigger selling points were seeing two of my favourite actors Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons again (and reunited after 'A Merchant in Venice'). Jared Leto has always been very take and leave. 'House of Gucci' turned out to be one of those difficult to rate and review sort of films for me, it is going to be one of those films that some are going to love and others are going to hate (with some in between). It is a hugely flawed film, but there was also a lot to enjoy at the same time. As far as Scott's films go, it's a middling effort. Neither one of his best or worst.'House of Gucci' has a lot that is good in my view. Have very little to complain about when it comes to how it looks, apart from some editing being in need of a tightening in the final act. The Italian scenery and the costumes are truly stunning though and the camerawork is similarly sumptuous. Scott's direction is uneven dramatically but is very impressive on a technical level, especially in his use of multiple cameras (which must make it easy for actors to know where to look). The soundtrack is also wonderful and beautifully operatic in scope, though not always well placed, but from a standalone point of view there are no complaints here.Despite the very all over the place accents, with a mix of exaggerated (Leto, to almost cartoonish effect in his case) or barely there (Irons, am a huge fan of Irons but will never deny about accents not being a forte of his), most of the acting is fine. Lady Gaga kills it as Patrizia, who is a very interesting and well fleshed out character here, bringing charm, effortless charisma and menace to her. It has been said that her accent isn't great, as far as the cast goes it's actually the most convincing one along with Salma Hayek's. Adam Driver is a good deal more understated, one of the few in the cast to play it very straight, but he is also compelling and his character growth/decent is believable. They have great chemistry together.The supporting cast on the whole support them well, Pacino coming off best having a whale of a time as Aldo. Irons brings vulnerability and authority to patriarch Rodolfo and Salma Hayek gives some of her best acting in years. Really liked the chemistry on the whole, Lady Gaga and Driver are great together as are Lady Gaga and Hayek, while that between Irons and Pacino is a joy. 'House of Gucci' does have a few great individual scenes, and one of the best is the magnificent encounter between Irons and Pacino. Personally thought the first half was fine and that it set up the intrigue and characters extremely well. As well as a few funny moments, Rodolfo's verbal brutalising of Paolo was gold and sums up the viewer's opinion of him and his work perfectly.On the other hand, 'House of Gucci' has a number of shortcomings. One performance didn't work for me and that was Leto. Unrecognisable in much talked about(the talk of social media when advertising was first revealed) makeup that deserves its own film, he overplays his role, especially when the comic relief becomes more dominant, and belongs in a completely different film. Yes the film is very over the top in tone, but Leto's performance veered on excess and too much of a Super Mario Brothers caricature. There are pacing issues, the rather underdeveloped family business stuff drags, sometimes to the point of stalling, due to the lack of tension and gravitas that was not there enough. And other parts come over as very choppy and incomplete feeling, like the final act. The second half needed a tightening up, which would have made the film less overlong (and it is a film that could have been 25 minutes shorter easily).Also found the ending very rushed and anti-climactic, handled with too much of an indifferent shrug. After spending so long on the family stuff (and not developing that enough) and the increasingly uneasy spurts of comedy, the event that caused such a sensation is just too throwaway in treatment. Tonally, 'House of Gucci' is messy, the comedy going for the campy approach that goes too far into pantomime in the second half and some of the serious moments being too melodramatic. Tonal shifts can be uneasily abrupt.The script has some funny and intriguing moments, but is on the whole too overwritten in tone (Leto's comedy increasingly gets too much), bland emotionally (the descent into revenge is not examined enough) and also too much of a trying to include as many iconic lines as possible. Some of the line delivery has to be heard to be believed, can imagine right now the amount of reaction gifs online in regard to some of the more comedic lines and Leto's body language.Concluding, hugely flawed but also quite fun when taking it for what it is. 5.5/10 (was struggling which score of 5 or 6 to give it but decided to go in between and round it up)"
tt11214590,6.0,"It's 1978 Milan. Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) meets Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) at a nightclub. He is the heir to a large portion of the fashion house Gucci but his father disapproves of her supposed mafia family although they only own a small trucking company. He marries her anyways and his father disowns him.For me, this is all about the accent. Everybody is speaking English but in an overt Italian accent. It's distracting. As a story, I would concentrate more on the murder and the decline feels rushed. At least, it should be equal to the rest of the movie. Maybe this needs to be a limited series on a streaming service. The acting seems to be getting accolades. I don't mind that. They're doing good work. The accent is just not my preference. All in all, this is a functional biopic with interesting actors doing a specific choice."
tt11214590,5.0,"House of Gucci is a new crime drama directed by Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator and Alien.The film is inspired by true events surrounding the family behind the Italian fashion house Gucci. When Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) begins a relationship with the outsider Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga), he is disinherited by his father Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons). He suspects that Patrizia is behind Maurizio's family money. That's how the two have to make it without the support of the Gucci family. Years later, the two are married and have a child together. Maurizio's uncle Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino) thus contacts him again and brings him back into the family business. The Gucci fashion house is once again going under multiple names, leading to creative differences, exposing betrayal, revenge and even murder cases.There have been many changes in the making of this film. Martin Scorsese, for example, could have directed the film at first, but Ridley Scott was eventually given a directing position. Together with the casting directors, he also had many ideas for the casting of the roles before they finally came to the chosen actors and actresses.After the many changes in casting and direction, they probably should have looked back at the writing crew of the film, because the final script was written by more novice writers, which can sometimes be seen in the film. The story can sometimes seem a bit messy and so long-winded, because the story makes many jumps in time. Some relationships come across as rushed, which can cause some loss of credibility.What comes out best in the film about a well-known fashion brand is therefore the costumes and make-up of the characters. Janty Yates can expect film award nominations for this. Still, the film has received complaints from actual members of the Gucci family that the relatives were better dressed in real life compared to the actors in the film. They also credibly convey the places where the story takes place.Al Pacino comes out the best of the film cast and knows how to provide the best and most believable accent compared to the entire cast. Lady Gaga and Adam Driver have good chemistry together in the film, but their relationship sometimes comes across as weak. Patrizia is clearly showing signs that she is more behind the Gucci family's money than she really loves Maurizio. Their accents can also come across as a bit unusual. Lady Gaga has more of an Eastern European accent than real Italian. Her characters seem to come more from Russia in some scenes. Of the entire cast, Salma Hayek is the only one who has received help with speaking in the correct accent. This is probably because she is married to the man who now owns the Gucci brand. If they had helped the entire cast a little more with their accents in the film, they would have come across a bit more like people from the same country. Who even seems to play in a completely different film is Jared Leto, because in the film he wears a fattening costume and also has a strange shaved hair style. In the film, he comes across as too exaggerated compared to the rest and speaks excessively in a high-pitched voice. He sometimes sounds just like the video game character Mario."
tt11214590,6.0,"House of Gucci is probably the most stylish film of 2021, it looked awesome, this was beautifully made, the quality of production and direction is phenomenal. It isn't just style over substance though, it's well made, generally well acted, it tells a fascinating and twisted story.The main issue about this film for me, was the pacing, it was somewhat uneven, at times it felt frustratingly slow, fortunately it did pick up at its conclusion. The running time was overlong, what is it with films in 2021? Why the need for everything to be almost three hours? Is there some deal for cost per minute at cinemas? Ninety minute films work too.If you ever think your family has problems, just watch this, and you'll see what family problems really are. Scandal, betrayal and murder, it's a rags to riches story with a twist.The acting, for the most part I thought it was great, Jeremy Irons was the standout for me, as he so often is, but Lady Gaga was awesome as Patrizia, she did a great job. Adam Driver on the other hand, I'm not sure why, but I felt as though he was a little uninterested, perhaps a little bored?6/10."
tt11214590,6.0,"A film so out of its mind that it is operating entirely on impulses, House of Gucci makes for a wild, inconsistent & unabashedly over-the-top biographical crime drama that chronicles the downfall of the Gucci family dynasty without any intent or interest and is surprisingly fuelled by absolutely unhinged performances, each functioning on a separate wavelength and pointed in a different direction.Directed by Ridley Scott, this tonal nightmare plays out like an (un)intentional parody of the Oscar-bait biopics and is far from the quality of work we expect from the filmmaker at helm. All its elements are at odds with each other, thus resulting in a film so bonkers & unpredictable in its approach & execution that it actually piques the curiosity in a way that's not just unusual or unexpected but also nonsensical.However, a story treatment this uneven & erratic can only carry on for a while before the appeal goes away and this one goes on for 157 long minutes, all of which is tediously paced. The characters themselves are mere caricatures and the ensemble cast is given the license to render them as such. But none of the actors are ever on the same level or looking for any kind of harmony even when sharing screen together.Overall, House of Gucci is inarguably the ""so bad it's good"" film of the year. Laced with irony, drowning in decadence and incongruous in each n every aspect, this overlong & overbearing train-wreck suffers from issues of its own makings and despite boasting an A-list ensemble, it doesn't utilise a shred of their talents. Inadvertently hilarious & downright mediocre, Ridley Scott's latest is what happens when the entire cast n crew is left unsupervised & goes amok."
tt11214590,5.0,"""House of Gucci"" portrays Maurizio Gucci and Patrizia Reggiani, trying to expand the family business. Gucci in the 60s was already a big empire and as an outsider that never really cared about fashion, I am not really sure what was the point of this motion picture. The film shows how Maurizio took over the company with his unethical methods, but aside from ruining completely the relationship with his own family members, it seems that he did not accomplish anything. He improved nothing in the business and took the enterprise to the verge of bankruptcy, so he did more harm than good. Patrizia Reggiani was for the whole time so manipulative, and I hated her character for the whole time. She was in fact after the Gucci money. Maurizio should have listened to his father. The beginning of their relationship is portrayed in such a childish and immature way. I refuse to believe that this is what really happened between the two. At this point I would have preferred to watch a film about Aldo Gucci, and how he managed to transform a small business into such a big and rich company. It would have been way more interesting and at least I would have walked out of the theatre with a little bit more knowledge.A lot of scenes feel odd, empty and pointless. Lady Gaga is stunning and gave a decent performance, but they could have hired someone more competent. She is an excellent singer, but please, keep her away from acting. I really enjoyed Adam Driver and Al Pacino. Jared Leto's acting was different and quite funny, he was a pleasant surprise, and he added a lot of value to the film. From a technical perspective, the photography was smooth and simple and perfectly matched the mood of the film.I have to be honest: I had quite big expectations for this one, but I was extremely disappointed. I went to see this movie mainly because of the director and the cast. I know nothing about fashion or Gucci, maybe I am not in the target area, but still I think that they could have done so much more with a big brand such as this one. The plot has its good moments and it is entertaining enough to keep me until the end, even though I would have cut a couple of scenes. It is not a bad production, but I think that this was an unnecessary and uninspired movie. I would recommend waiting for the release of ""House of Gucci"" on some streaming service or on Blu-ray. For me it is not worth going to the cinema for it."
tt11214590,5.0,"The second Ridley Scott film of this year is here! After his medieval epic The Last Duel flopped brilliantly at the box office, he can expect more in this respect with House of Gucci. Not only is Gucci one of the most famous and prestigious fashion brands, Lady Gaga is also in the lead role. I guess the strong fanbase of the singer will not be asked a second time. In the film, she suddenly finds herself part of the Gucci dynasty and becomes the protagonist of a toxic power struggle.Yet Gaga is still a relative unknown in Hollywood-speak. She made her big breakthrough in the 2018 music film A Star is Born. Scott, as he did in The Last Duel, has assembled an incomparable star ensemble. Adam Driver, who seems to be establishing himself as the director's new darling, evergreens Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons and an unrecognisable Jared Leto embody the key roles in the Gucci clan. In addition, Salma Hayek emerges as a kind of mentor for Gaga's character. But who is Gaga playing anyway? She is the young and rebellious Patrizia Reggiani. An extroverted perennial who worms her way into the millionaire family with charm and fascination. She is courted by the ambitious Maurizio Gucci, played by Driver, who actually wants to leave the intrigues and sometimes shabby business dealings of his predecessors behind. Once he falls in love with Patrizia and marries her, he is left with no choice but to get involved again. Driver and Gaga share a very passionate chemistry in the first act, which you fully buy into with little dialogue and through pure body language. While Driver plays rather reserved and shy, this quality emanates especially from Gaga, who doesn't hold back in any of her intimate scenes. At least the two characters are able to unfold their own approaches here. But when Al Pacino's character Aldo Gucci, Maurizio's uncle, insists on his nephew's re-entry into the family business, the two lose all closeness to each other. Rather, it is only an extremely manipulative relationship that both actors have to show in a few scenes. All the more Aldo and his son Paolo Gucci, portrayed by Leto, come to the fore. From this point on, the film lapses into a few minutes of megalomania, largely due to Leto's performance. He is exclusively eccentric and desperate and all in all a tragic figure. Whether you find this Super Mario caricature brilliant or miserable is a matter of interpretation.House of Gucci begins extremely quietly and shows the rise of the lovers in well-done visual sequences. The performances are generally fitting and although the film seems anti-Italian, I love it when Adam Driver cruises through Milan on his Vespa. But as interesting as the pecking order and hierarchy within the Gucci family is, from the second act onwards the film devolves into an overplayed and hyperactive tragedy that, despite the craziness of its scenes and actors, actually manages to be long-winded. Fashion, creativity and the business idea are not a theme at all, which in no way brings us closer to this brand that is so present. In the end we have a family epic (the film lasts 2 ½ hours), with exclusively unsympathetic characters. One more request to Ridley Scott: just let your actors speak English and don't embarrass them with Italian stereotypes with accents."
tt11214590,5.0,"Based on true events usually means that the true events are fictionalized and made more spectacular. Since I am Italian, I already knew what happened between Patrizia Reggiani and Maurizio Gucci, because at the time their lurid story occupied headlines in national newspapers. The real story seemed to have gone more or less as described, with Patrizia being a vulgar gold digger, who used to consult fortune tellers and ended up hiring her killer via her ""clairvoyant"" BFF, once Maurizio dumped her.Lady Gaga nails the part, probably thanks to her natural arrogance, and she looks a lot like a prettier version of the real Patrizia; Driver is bland as usual, although his part probably called for a weak character; Pacino is a tad more subdued than usual, which is much appreciated but Jared Leto as Paolo Gucci is unbearable, more than an eccentric Italian he does a version of what an American considers typical Italian, missing completely the mark and spoiling it further with a dreadful accent.Even if costumes and locations are generally OK, the soundtrack is extremely sloppy, as if nobody could be bothered to do some research and produce a soundtrack suitable to the time and place. Instead, they took the shortcut of going for Italian opera, the trite soundtrack of choice for movies with Italian characters, even if by now is super outdated; a couple of Italian songs from the Sixties sounded totally wrong because the film takes places in the Eighties and a few disco hits blasted on incongruously at the wrong time... totally not an Italian atmosphere, unless you think in Italy time stopped with La Dolce Vita, or even earlier with Verdi.Apart from the dreadful soundtrack, some parts (mainly all those with Leto) dragged on too long and dragged the movie down.PS in the first third of the film Maurizio Gucci is jumping wildly inside one of the shops and stopping in a freeze-frame that we discover right at the end, belongs to a photo shooting with Avedon. What was that? Did nobody check the editing?"
tt11214590,6.0,"As I'm on holiday at the moment in Portugal, this was seen as ""Casa de Gucci"". But the soundtrack was English with Portuguese subtitles. At least, I *think* it was English!Positives:
Other than the bare outlines, it's a story I knew nothing about, so it made for interesting viewing. And who doesn't want to see some escapist high-fashion, flashy cars and Italian high-living on the big screen?Adam Driver delivers another stonking performance. He delivers the best of the accents on show and is a delight to watch whenever he's on screen. His performance is deliciously subtle and under-played. A model for acting lessons.Al Pacino, in full-on Pacino mode, is also great as Maurizio's uncle: owner of the other half of the empire.Negatives:
The accents! Where do I begin? I felt a desperate need mid-film to order a Cornetto and go compare my car insurance online. While Driver and Pacino tend to rein it in, most of the rest of the cast assume accents approaching a bad parody of Italians. Jared Leto and Gaga are particularly guilty.I appreciate that the part of the ""idiot"" Paolo Gucci was meant to be comedic, but Jared Leto seems to almost be in a different film entirely. There's 'over-the-top' and 'waaaaay over-the-top'.I've seen some other reviews praising Lady Gaga... saying that it proves her performance in ""A Star is Born"" wasn't just a ""flash in the pan"". Personally, I didn't feel it. I appreciate that the character of Patrizia is a larger-than-life one. But, although she did have some impressive scenes, for most of her performance I felt like she was obviously acting, and sometimes over-acting. The accent didn't help.The film has a banging set of tunes, no argument. But for a sprawling drama told over a few decades (the film is nearly 160 minutes long!), music should be used to anchor the movie as to which year you are currently in. Donna Summer ""I Feel Love"": so it must be 1977. But the movie doesn't consistently follow that rule. It's the early 70's, but suddenly George Michael's ""Faith"" blares out. #Unsettling.This may be my lack of concentration, but there seems to be an assertion in the film (presumably completely false) that Aldo Gucci was supporting/producing knockoff Gucci products for the mass-market: a ""lucrative product line"" that was later canned by Maurizio. I was personally confused by this bit of the story.Summary Thoughts on ""House of Gucci"": This was not the <2* bust that I thought it might be from early word I saw from other reviews. The fact that it turns out to be a 158 minute film surprised me, since it felt long... but not that long. So that's a good thing. And it has its moments for sure. But this is not a movie that I will be in a hurry to revisit, since the accents and some of the performances (Jared Leto - take one step forwards) are not ones that I thought worthy of the potential that the movie had. For me, Ridley, I'll take ""The Last Duel"" any day.(For the full graphical review, check out #onemannsmovies online. Thanks.)"
tt11214590,5.0,"Ridley Scott assembled an all-star cast for his period crime drama ""House of Gucci,"" but unfortunately the film's quality doesn't match the talents of those involved. The film tells the story of the relationship between Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) and Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga,) as Maurizio tries to exert greater control over Gucci and expand its financial footing. Despite what the trailers may have you believe, most of the movie isn't about the assassination of Maurizio. While the film tries to settle on a variety of tones and plot points to emphasize, it ends up being a giant mess on many levels.The performances are a mixed bag, as each of the main actors seems to be acting as if they are in a different movie from one another. Adam Driver tries his best as an ambitious, no-nonsense Gucci, but performance lacks range and can feel cold at times. Lady Gaga is mostly solid, although some might feel that she overacts a little. Al Pacino is good, but unfortunately underused. Jared Leto's character is almost cartoonishly annoying and ridiculous. The screenplay isn't terrible, but it is rather generic and contains tons of unnecessary filler. Even scenes that could be potentially interesting on paper, such as a masquerade party where Maurizio and Patrizia met for the first time, are stripped down to predictable clichés when shown on screen. The film's aesthetics are uneven. As one might expect, the costumes are gorgeously and intricately detailed, while the cinematography of northern Italy is often potent. Yet the film suffers from poor editing, as some scenes are punctuated or accentuated by a quick finishing or starting cut to another moment that seems wholly unnecessary or abrupt. Yet ""House of Gucci""'s biggest flaw is simply that it is just dull and often boring. By failing to make its primary characters engaging or stick to a well-paced narrative structure, viewers may question whether the film really needs to be 157 minutes long. It's unfortunate that this film ended up being a misfire, given that both Ridley Scott and the talented actors making up the film's ensemble cast are capable of so much better. Not recommended. 5/10."
tt11214590,5.0,"""It's Not As Bad As You Heard"" is the very definition of damning with faint praise, but that phrase accurately describes one of the highest profile film failures of 2021 - HOUSE OF GUCCI.Directed by Ridley Scott with a screenplay by Becky Johnson and Roberto Bentivegna (based on the book by Sara Gay Forden), HOUSE OF GUCCI tells the tale of the Gucci family and their fashion empire as the family sees a transition from the older generation to the new - and the outsider who stirred the pot.This film is filled with stars - Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons and Jared Leto - and is Directed by the great Ridley Scott, so why didn't this film work?Ultimately, films rise and fall with the script and the direction thereof, and unfortunately, both of these fall well short of good...but above bad.Ridley Scott seemed to direct this film with the attitude of ""the actors will fill out the thinness of the script, so I'll just leave them to their own devices"", and this approach just doesn't work.Lady Gaga, so good in A STAR IS BORN, is just a little lost as Patricia Reggiani - the outsider (some would say Gold Digger) who digs her claws into a hapless Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver). The first part of this film is mostly interesting as we watch Patricia manipulate Maurizio into marrying her - much to the dismay of his unapproving father, Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons, in the only characterization of this film that works from beginning to end). Driver is mostly good as the milquetoast heir who grows into a Business Mogul, but his character is mostly dealing with internal turmoil that turns into blank expressions on screen - NOT a good move for a movie.And then the film takes a turn into burlesque with the introduction of Rodolfo's brother and business partner, Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino) and his ""idiot son"", Paolo Gucci (Jared Leto, unrecognizable under his make-up). It's not often that you can say that Pacino is ""out-over-acted"" by another performer, but Leto mops the floor with him. While Pacino, actually, dials back his usual tendency to over-act, Leto goes all in on the over-acting front - so much so that one has to wonder what type of film that Leto thought he was acting in.Ultimately, the film falls short because of a lack of focus. The movie (kind of) tries to tell the story from every characters' point of view and in that attempt, fails, and ends up telling the story from no one's point of view. The film starts with Gaga's character being the entry point into the story for the viewer, but then we kareem off into Driver's story, somewhat, and them (maybe) Pacino and Leto's before coming back to Gaga (for a small bit) and then jumping over to Driver's...Well, you get the point. House of Gucci loses it's focus along the way so you are left wishing you could get more from these characters - except for Leto's - you wish there was a lot less.Letter Grade: C+5 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
tt11214590,5.0,"Ridley Scott's movie of the marriage of Maurizio and Patrizia Gucci which led to the latter being convicted with her accomplices of arranging her husband's broad-daylight murder, I'm afraid I found overlong and at times boring...Of course the background story is interesting, as poor Patrizia, the daughter of a truck company owner, played by pop star Lady Gaga, meets the shy, geekish Maurizio, (Adam Driver), at a party, then arranges an accidental meeting to see him again and it's not long before his seduction is complete and he's introducing her to his snobbish, vain old retired-actor dad, Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons) who soon after he learns she can't tell a Picasso from a Klimt, writes her off as a gold-digger and promptly cuts them both off from the family fortune after they marry.For me, this was the best part of the film, a forbidden love story set in 70's and 80's Milan to a background of pulsating Donna Summer records. Then enter Al Pacino as Uncle Aldo, Rodolfo's brother who perhaps as a reaction to his poor relationship with his own idiot son Paolo (Jared Leto) himself a misguided would-be fashion designer who has as much talent and flair as a used match, takes a shine to the disowned couple and brings them into the family business. Big mistake!Pacino of course doesn't do quiet anymore and immediately he appears, makes a beeline for the scenery to sink his teeth into it. From there, the plot thickens as the company fortunes slip and the family control diminishes. Eventually too, Maurizio tires of Patrizia and leaves her for a young blonde he meets on the ski-slopes which act proves to be the decisive one in pushing his estranged wife over the edge to hatch her murder plot.Maybe it's just the subject matter of the fashion world that doesn't interest me much, but I found it difficult to be much engaged by the lifestyles of the rich and famous depicted here. Gaga works hard, maybe too hard, as the upwardly mobile Patrizia but Driver seems to get by a lot with just his goofy smile behind his character's oversized glasses.At nearly three hours long, it seemed to me to me as if a sharp pair of scissors were needed to cut this maxi-length material down to a more manageable length. As it was, I will confess to nodding off more than once at the lack of dramatic tension on the screen.Sometimes these dramatised retellings of real-life events work well as movies while some are better served as straight documentaries. This particular feature for me probably fell into the latter category."

Johansson is good transitioning from victim to machine-like superbeing. I like going to a lesser used exotic location like Taiwan. However Besson tries to be profound. It descends into a lot of mumbo jumbo. At which point, I realize the whole movie is a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo. It wouldn't matter so much but Besson seems to really want to say something.

Rex time, and big, black, self-building computers against a white background while Freeman and associates stand around slack-jawed, and Freeman explains exactly what's going on.

tt2463208,5.0,"This film is bad. There is no way around it. And I know that there are many other films with the same amount of logic holes (and perhaps the same plot!) that are considered at least average, but those are older movies. If you clone a barely average old film now and all you have to add to it is Ryan Reynolds' jokes as an improvement, then you fail.Forget that time travel films are notoriously hard to have making sense: even in that very specific subgenre, this film is at the bottom of anything resembling reason. What you are left with are (very!) cheap video game like special effects, Reynolds' and the kid (he did a good work, BTW) spouting jokes and puns and guest star appearances from Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner and Zoe Saldana (they all have like a few minutes of screen time each, just to get a paycheck). Even the ""endearing"" part that people talk about is mostly nostalgia for better films from 30 years ago and nothing to do with the script.Bottom line: I like Ryan Reynolds, he is fun, but all of his movies have become the same thing with different backgrounds. They don't even make the effort to make it seem like they tried. With this in mind, I doubt even Deadpool 3 will be any different, which would be a terrible shame. Films like The Adam Project are a disgrace, a show of bad faith and lack of respect to viewers. At least Reynolds should know better."
tt2463208,6.0,"Well, based on the cast ensemble alone then I figured that this 2022 sci-fi action adventure would be a movie worth-while watching. And thus, I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch what writers Jonathan Tropper, T. S. Nowlin, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin had in store with this movie.And honestly, then the movie was every bit as entertaining and enjoyable as anticipated. Which means that director Shawn Levy managed to do a great job at bringing the script and storyline to life on the screen in an enjoyable and entertaining manner.Sure, ""The Adam Project"" is the type of movie where you essentially just lean back, munch on the snacks and watch the movie. Yeah, it wasn't particularly a very cerebral movie, despite of it revolving around something as complex as time travel. But hey, it is a movie meant for entertainment after all, this wasn't exactly an exact science.Visually then ""The Adam Project"" is rather impressive. But of course, with a movie project such as this, the funding is large and very capable of sustaining great visuals. And a movie such as ""The Adam Project"" does need proper CGI effects to fully function as intended on the screen. And trust me, the effects served their purpose.""The Adam Project"" has a good cast ensemble, which funnily enough brought together four members of the Marvel CMU, a funny little detail. Especially since ""The Adam Project"" does poke fun at aforementioned MCU. The movie has the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana and Jennifer Garner on the cast list to carry the movie, which they did quite well. In addition, the young actor Walker Scobell really managed to stand tall among such established performers.While ""The Adam Project"" certainly is a watchable and enjoyable movie, it hardly strikes me as a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, as the storyline just didn't have all that much solid contents to it.My rating of ""The Adam Project"" lands on a six out of ten stars."

Saldana is the sexy fighter. Garner is the suffering mom. I like Ryan with his younger self until it runs into a bump in the road. The younger self can't be the zen advisor to the older self. This movie is working very hard to be action-packed fun but the fighting becomes repetitive. This is a middling sci-fi action flick on Netflix that stumbles a few times.

It is set either on an island off the Florida coast, or a nearby Caribbean Island where US money is used, but is actually filmed in Mauritius east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Lots of background music is Louisiana Cajun music, an interesting combination.This movie is really interesting and good but has a somewhat low IMDb rating because many viewers expected a straightforward narrative, I suppose. The opening shot gives us a hint of what is happening, the face of a young teenage boy, then into his eye, which expands to a fishing boat in the ocean. The captain of that boat, the Serenity, is Matthew McConaughey as Baker Dill.The details can be gleaned by reading any of several user reviews with ""Spoilers"", suffice to say it has elements that reminded me of movies like ""Frequency"", ""Inception"", and ""The Matrix.""

At first I didn't know where the story was going but as the film unfolded, it became quite clear what the story was telling us, on another coping mechanism a child may use to escape domestic and the breaking point of said mechanism. The bad reviews are 100% wrong, because to not like the story is saying I don't understand abuse and don't care what tolls it may take on child. Don't get me wrong, the story a tad bit farfetched but overall it made sense and was enjoyable to watch.

I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.However, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.Overall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage."
tt7713068,5.0,"The latest DC Comics superhero movie and once again it's rather generic and forgettable in tone. The action in this one is okay but the comedy is very poor and Harley Quinn herself is best in small doses, so making her the lead character is a bizarre choice. The deliberately adult tone just means constant swearing shoehorned into the script while Ewan McGregor's bad guy is as bland as they come. It's better than GUNPOWDER MILKSHAKE thanks to a couple of halfway decent action scenes and creatively quirky moments, but the rest is merely so-so."
tt7713068,5.0,"If you are not driven by the imperative need of understanding precisely what is happening in your movie, you might enjoy this psychedelic mix of disjointed cool visuals, great music, firecrackers, fragments of good acting...
Birds Of Prey is a mess presented in a messy way, it hardly holds together as a story but it offers moments of fun."
tt7713068,6.0,"In Gotham City, the Joker breaks up with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and without his protection, several criminals that have a beef with her hunt her down. When the teenager Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) pickpockets a diamond that has the account numbers of a fortune from the gangster Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), who is the right-hand of the powerful criminal Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), he put a contract on her. Harley Quinn, Police Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), Helena ""The Huntress"" Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Dinah ""Black Canary"" Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) team up to protect Cassandra.""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" is a silly and entertaining adventure of the anarchic psychiatrist Harley Quinn. The plot is a mess with many silly scenes trying to be funny, but the conclusion is full of action and entertains. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Aves de Rapina: Arlequina e sua Emancipação Fantabulosa"" (""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"")"
tt7713068,6.0,"Admittedly speaking, remember there was a time when DC Universe was bashed because most of their movies were directed by Zack Snyder who decided that style-over-substance was more pivotal to making superhero films? Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.Now after Shazam!, Aquaman & the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe. No feud here please.Here's my thoughts on Birds of Prey:The movie features slick action scenes which complete with very acrobatic-like choreography that constantly pleases the eyes of everyone who are looking forward for femme fatales kicking ass. There are plenty of them to keep you amazed.Birds of Prey also delivers a vigorous energy throughout, it feels like you are high on drugs. The close-ups feel very intimate yet feel very caricature in a positive way. The quality of cameras & the colour palette capture a reality of life, giving a sense of how rough it actually is, very dark and gritty but... also sometimes sprinkles the dour tone with graciously boisterous and delicate tinted colours. The occasional slo-mo ampes up the already intense energy.Some of you might have asked regarding the feminist movement. Birds of Prey is a done right feminist film. A key successful factor to driving a feminist film is to create an innate story on women without being pushy on the political agenda. Birds of Prey does that. Another thing is this is not a guy-turn-girl remakes (Yes, I'm watching you Ghostbusters & Ocean's 8). And BOP does not or rarely knocks down the men genes as weak or indecisive. Kudos Birds of Prey!Now, let's talk about Margot Robbie & Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two really go beyond the next level to dive into their character as uniquely as possible. Margot Robbie as always should be receiving a standing ovation as Harley Quinn again, after the meh Suicide Squad. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow! Winstead as Huntress is the runner up here, she gives out a hot breeze of aura that it is hard to back away from. Her charismatic sexual energy captures the attention like a bullseye 🎯. Bell as Black Canary is cool, but not as great as the other two. Bella as Cain shows to be mischievous but her character only pretty much follows where the major characters take her.It also offers decent humour overall. Harley Quinn is consciously great in this, her facial movements contribute a lot! Some are fresh from the oven, others are a bit obsolete but those humours though feel old keep us glued to the screen.Final battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts.Now, the most detectable problem with this movie is it spends so much time on character development of the all-girls group that it forgets that they can excite the audience with the combo pack. An hour later and they are still focusing on so many character devs!Because of this, the relationship between members of Birds of Prey is very shadowy and leaves an unsatisfied feeling by the end. Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.So many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it, providing us with a lack of knowledge of what his wholesome embodies.Hyena & police cop. With a lack of screen time, we do not really see Hyena attacking people at all which some of you might have anticipated. Renee as the cop is one that is really bad at acting, it needs fixing. It is like watching a brick talks with try-hard emotions.While this centres on supervillains, Birds of Prey fails on the costume design. Not a single character clothes himself/herself as a good superhero model portrayal of a costume. It feels very lazy thus, this however tones down the great energy the movie has possessed. It is so bad that varsity students can design them better.Verdict: Imaginative & darkly flamboyant, Birds of Prey proves that the comeback of DC is possible, adapting many characters into the big screen as a beacon of call to level itself with the colossal Marvel."
tt0139134,6.0,"Once upon a time there were three young actresses named Sarah Michelle, Selma and Laura Jean, who for reasons best known to herself preferred to be called Reese. They acted together in a film called ""Cruel Intentions"", after which fate had different things in store for our three friends. Sarah Michelle went on to star in the two ""Scooby-Doo"" films which achieved the difficult feat of making even the original cartoon series look intelligent by comparison. Selma may one day become the greatest Lady Macbeth of the twenty-first century, but even if she does she will have difficulty living down the ""I can't believe I'm making love to a big purple elephant"" scene from the awesomely tasteless ""The Sweetest Thing"". (Yes, I know she didn't say ""making love"" but decency forbids a verbatim quotation). And Reese? Reese went on to give a cracking performance in one of the best films of 2005 and won a well-deserved Oscar. It just goes to show you never can tell.""Cruel Intentions"" transfers the basic plot of ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"" to a modern-day American school, thus doing for Choderlos de Laclos what ""Clueless"" did for Jane Austen. (Whether either Monsieur de Laclos or Miss Austen actually needed this service is a matter open to debate). The main characters become teenage step-siblings, Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont, both pupils at an exclusive boarding school. Most of the action takes place during the summer holidays and, like most teenagers with too much time on their hands, Kathryn and Sebastian are bored. In order to combat the monotony of their daily lives, they make a bet with one another that Sebastian can seduce Annette, the headmaster's daughter who has publicly proclaimed that she intends to save her virginity until marriage. If Sebastian fails, he will have to give Kathryn his most prized possession, a vintage sports car. If he succeeds, Kathryn will sleep with him. (Kinky, I know, but as they're not actually related by blood no criminal statutes will be violated). In addition, there is a sub-plot involving the evil pair's attempts to corrupt the morals of Cecile, a terminally naive girl who has somehow managed to snare Kathryn's boyfriend.As is normal in Hollywood films about teenagers, the lead parts are all played by actors several years older than the characters they represent. This convention seems to be motivated by censorship considerations; the American film censors seem to operate a curious double standard whereby plot lines about underage sex are acceptable provided the actors involved are all in their twenties (or, in some cases, their thirties).The film has been compared unfavourably with ""Dangerous Liaisons"", the ""straight"" version of the story from 1988. I have never, however, been a great admirer of Stephen Frears's film. Certainly, it is beautifully acted (much more so than ""Cruel Intentions""), but it always seemed to me to be claustrophobic and airless, set in its own highly artificial world. Its atmosphere of world-weariness and heartless cruelty never seems real, except perhaps to those who take at face value all those History Made Simple textbooks that tell us that the eighteenth century French aristocracy were all creepily decadent sadists who thoroughly deserved their fate at the hands of Madame Guillotine. ""Cruel Intentions"", by contrast, is not played straight, but transforms the story into a black comedy. Certainly, I doubt if real life teenagers would be quite as skilfully manipulative as Sebastian and Katherine, but this is not a realistic drama and has no ambitions to be one, so the question is not really relevant.Sarah Michelle Gellar has never struck me as a great actress. She was cute and sexy in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", but her character was never more than a cute and sexy version of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. About her role in ""Scooby-Doo"" the less said the better. In ""Cruel Intentions"", however, her rather mannered, knowing style of acting serves her well. Kathryn is an upper-class version of Cordelia, the character played by Charisma Carpenter in ""Buffy""- the attractive, seemingly popular girl who, underneath the surface, is a prize bitch. The difference is that whereas Cordelia was merely shallow and thoughtless, Kathryn is hard, brittle and positively malevolent. Sebastian is equally amoral- a hardened seducer without a though in his head for the rights or feelings of others. There is a hint in Ryan Philippe's portrayal that, like many hardened seducers, his seductions are undertaken in order to feed his ego as much as his libido.Of the pair's two victims, Selma Blair's Cecile is too much of a booby ever to attract our sympathy, the sort of girl who reminds us that not only did the word ""silly"" originally mean ""innocent"" but also that there is sometimes a close connection between innocence and silliness in the modern sense. Reese Witherspoon's Annette is a different matter. She resists the temptation to play her character either as another silly innocent or as a Bible-thumping born-again hypocrite. She makes Annette not only morally principled but also smart, shrewd and likable. At first she seems to have Sebastian's measure, but eventually neither her principles nor her shrewdness are proof against his lies and blandishments. She finds herself falling in love with him and allows him to seduce her.More surprisingly, Sebastian finds himself falling in love with Annette, so much so that he even refuses to claim his promised reward from Kathryn. It is at this point that the film abruptly changes tack. What started out as a cynical, amoral and sometimes witty black comedy becomes a sentimentally moralising conventional teen-film. The ending (which I will not reveal) is particularly tear-jerking. It is as though the film-makers lacked the courage of their convictions. Or perhaps I should say they lacked the courage of their lack of convictions. 6/10"
tt0139134,6.0,"There's a lesbian kiss between Sarah Michelle Gellar & Selma Blair's characters & sadly, that's what most people remember about this movie. Nevertheless, this film directed by Roger Kumble, originally named 'Cruel Inventions' before getting renamed, in order, to sound, less sci-fiction, has more to give, than just that. While, I wouldn't say, this American teenager film version is the best adaptation of author, Pierre Choderios de Laclo's 1782's novel, 'Les Liaisons dangereuses'; because it's not. I can say, the film about two teenager socialite step-siblings, Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) & Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe), using seduction as a weapon to socially control and exploit others like Cecile Caldwell (Selma Blair) & Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon), all the while enjoying their cruel games and boasting about their manipulative talents, was not that bad. It was mediocre, at best. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie didn't have the same success and impact, as 1988's 'Dangerous Liaisons', had; maybe, because writer, Roger Kumble use a modern teenager settling, with little to no stalks, attached to it, rather than, setting the movie, with older crowd in a more compelling and complex location, like Wall Street, Hollywood, or better yet, in order, to fit more, with the French-like libertinism themes of the novel, post Antebellum, New Orleans College Life. Another reason, why the original settling works so well, is because, that novel depict 'Ancien Régime' French aristocracy, so cruel & corrupt, that it justified, the reasons, why the French Revolution, was needed. Here, the film does not, expose the dark side of capitalism & materialism that much, to justified, any reform, nor does it, make, the characters, too unlikable to hate. Toward the middle of the movie, the tone of the piece, switch, from, exposing the perversions of upper society to romantic teen drama, about Sebastian, slowly, falling in love, with one of his victim, Annette. Sebastian is presented far more sympathetically than his counterpart in the original novel and its adaptations. Because of this, the tone of this bet, makes the film, seem like it belong in the same typical cheesy teen-pop vain as films like 1999's ""She's All that', than the cruel actions of 1959's 'Les liaisons dangereuses'. It's sad, because, this movie could had been something, so much, more, than kinda bland. Although, the film documents themes like incest, homosexuality, and miscegenation, it plays those subjects, pretty safe for a Rated R movie. Also, hardly any graphic nudity. This film, wasn't as risky as the original with its shining example of debauchery and decadence. After all, Valmont in the novel, does rape, and cause a lot of people to commit suicide, a lot more seriously. Sebastian in the film, is far from being, true-evil. Another big change from the novel, is the ending. Instead, of a justified duel to the death for a character that deserve it, the film, ends, bittersweet, with the lover, saving his love's life from accident. This ending, doesn't have the same impact as the original, because we know, that the character could perform an unselfish deed, while the reader of the novel has no way of knowing the protagonist true feelings. Did Valmont change for the good!? The book leave that, open-ended. I felt, the closure of 'Cruel Intentions', left, not enough work, for being thought-provoking. Another interesting observation that can be concluded after analyzing the film is the raw language is not as sophisticated as the book. I found the dialogue of the film, to be, shallow and not very memorable. Yet, another problem, with this film is overall, acting. While, Ryan Phillippe, was alright in the role, he was given. Some parts of his performance seem a little too annoying, whinny for my taste. The acting from Sarah Michelle Gellar was a little worst, with her going a little, too cartoony, over the top with being a vileness. Both young performers, couldn't touch, the sublime narcissistic egotism that, Glenn Close & John Malkovich pull off, in the 1988's film. Despite that, I have to say, the supporting cast was a lot better. While, Selma Blair's character, was made into a clueless ditz. She did play the role, well. The same with Reese Witherspoon. She really did, seem like she was the angelic virgin, despite, stealing a vintage car in the end. As for the adult performers, in this film. There were very unremarkable. I totally forgot that actress, Christine Baranski & Louise Fletcher, were in this film. That's how much, they didn't shine. Despite that, I do have to say, the movie was beautiful shot. The escalator scene, toward the end, was very noticeable. Another great thing, about this film, is the beautiful, well-crafted soundtrack. This movie had some of the best musicians of the '90s: 'Placebo, Aimee Mann, Skunk Anansie, Blur, and The Verve' to name, a few. It was nice to listen to. As for the sequels/prequels like 2000's 'Cruel Intentions 2' & 2004's 'Cruel Intentions 3'. They weren't worth checking out. However, the 2016 TV Movie/pilot of television series of the same name, might be worth seeing, if the footage is ever released. Overall: Despite its many flaws, this movie is still worth checking. 'Cruel Intentions' was somewhat seduced at the time."
tt0139134,6.0,"'Cruel Intentions' updates Choderlos de Laclos 18th Century novel of sex, deception and morality (or lack thereof) for the 'Buffy'/MTV generation and falls flat on its ass. This is a movie so God-awfully embarrassing that you wouldn't even wish it on a Backstreet Boys fan!All the cleverness, subtlety and ironic wit of the original story is lost in this dumbed down Gen Next mess. It doesn't even work on the trash level of similar superficial crap like 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer' or 'Wild Things'. It's just plain BAD in every department!Gellar and Phillippe completely fail to convince as the Machiavellian anti-heroes. You do not believe in them for one second, and that is the major problem with this movie. But not the only problem. The acting is uniformly awful, but special mention must go to Selma Blair who will have you cringing in disbelief. It's a wonder she ever worked again after this. The usually impressive Reese Witherspoon fares the least worst from this turkey, but no-one could seriously claim that this role is one for her to be proud of. Let's just pretend it just never happened, okay?
'Cruel Intentions' is THE PITS. If you're too brain-dead from watching Britney and Christina videos all day, try any of the three previous versions of this story. They are all worth watching, and all demolish this fiasco. And if you want to see a REALLY cynical and wickedly subversive teen spoof try Gregg Araki's 'Nowhere'. It's twenty times the movie this will EVER be! The decision is yours..."

And for the most part, it works very well.But the script is very bad, and the inclusion of Jones as Cooper is an awful inclusion as he he is just there for comic relief, and feels really out of place in this sort of film.Fishburne and Neill do the norm and are as watchable as ever, but it's the supporting cast that really surprise in this. Issacs and Pertwee are really good, and show that they are as reliable as always.Visually it's very impressive, and the build and maguffin are quite unsettling, but after a while, it turns into a film about people walking down a corridor and trying not to look into a spinning ball.The final act, which should have been shocking and macabre, is daft and way over the top, and although it's action packed, it's pretty boring in the end.So it's a fun set up, which is quite eerie in parts, but the ending lets it down, becoming ridiculous and killing of characters as quick as the makers can.Hello to Jason Issacs"
tt0119081,6.0,"'Event Horizon' is very much an atmospheric sci-fi horror. It does not rely on gore (although there is enough of that) but rather it is the creepy atmosphere that engages the viewer. Andersen successfully creates a tense, depressing, and claustrophobic atmosphere. The suspense and pace are well maintained. It pays tribute to several movies of the same genre (like 'The Shining', 'Aliens' etc). Character development is slightly weak but the actors do a good job and the viewer cares for them. Sam Neill, Laurence Fishburne, Kathleen Quinlan, Joely Richardson, Richard Jones and Jason Isaacs do a fine job with what they're given. The sets look very unwelcoming and creepy. The special effects and sound effects are good. The cinematography is superb. The plot is a little complex and difficult to follow in the beginning leaving the viewer wondering with what exactly is going on but this becomes easier with repeated viewings. In my view, 'Event Horizon' is an underrated film and perhaps did not get enough recognition because it did not have any stars or enough 'monsters' and 'blood' or perhaps the subject was a little too complex for some to grasp."
tt0119081,6.0,"Event Horizon is a decent movie. There's no question it's never going to win awards for originality, or anything else, frankly, but what it does it does well. It's based on the idea of a space ship, which disappeared just under a decade ago, reappearing mysteriously, prompting a search and rescue vessel to go in and investigate. Telling more would spoil the premise, so no more will be said. It is all set in the future, as much sci-fi is, and deep in outer space, of course. The performances are as polished as you'd expect from Sam Neill, as the doctor, and Laurence Fishbourne, as the scout ship captain, so there are generally no complaints there. The gore levels at times are not for the squeamish, but what else would you expect from an 18 (UK) rated movie? There are a fair number of predictable moments, and cliched lines, but the overall production is more than decent and able to keep your attention focused on the plot. A good effort all round, and the overall 5.5 rating it received here is a touch harsh. I'd say 7."
tt0119081,6.0,"Once upon a time there were two movies, both considered masterpieces of their genre.One was callied ""Alien"", the brilliantly realized SF/Horror film from Ridley Scott, about a deep space mission that brought back an unwanted predatory visitor from the imagination of Giger.The other film was called ""Solaris"", about a deep space mission that caused the crew to exhibit psychotic behavior and keep living out scenes from their earth life. Solaris, an intellectual film from the Soviet-era genius Andrei Tarkovsky,  is the more complex film. It does not attempt to explain whether the hallucinations are caused by an external force, space fever, passage into a time-space warp, or just the fact that you can't ever run from yourself, not matter how far you go. No monsters.""Event Horizon"" is a cross breed between these two legendary deep-space films. The monster is there, but it inhabits the minds of the crew, learns everything about them, every fear, every memory, and causes their insanity. Solaris with action, and an identified external cause. The idea was pretty damned good, the special effects and visuals were brilliant, and they hired a good cast. Some of the moments will scare the beejeepers out of you.But they went over the top in some ways. Too many explosions. A fist-fight with the monster, what's that all about? Too many empty-headed discussions about what man was or wasn't meant to know. Ultimately too little really original. Reviewers were sharply divided on this film. Some said it was a truly brilliant scare-fest, others thought is was a zero-star waste of their precious time. I don't know. It isn't Alien or Solaris, but it has a lot of positives and I enjoyed it, but I don't plan to watch it again."
tt0119081,6.0,"Originally conceived as THE SHINING in space, by the end I think EVENT HORIZON has become more like HELLRAISER in space, although of course one of the later HELLRAISER movies was just that. This is an intriguing and interesting sci-fi/horror movie that initially feels like an ALIEN clone before becoming something else quite different.The problem is that the story is sadly flawed, spending too much time on all-too-familiar situations and not enough time on the true horror envisaged by the screenwriter. It seems to take the crew an age to get to their destination, and even when stuff is finally happening, the ending is quite choppy. Apparently, 20 minutes of violent footage were excised after a poor reaction from the test audience, which I think is a real shame.Another problem lies in the choice of director Paul W. S. Anderson, who is and has been one of the worst directors working in Hollywood in recent years. This and DEATH RACE are the only films I truly like of his, and even in these two movies his direction is poor and over the top. The laboured comic relief is particularly noticeable here.It's a pity, because the story has real potential, with undertones of Clive Barker and H. P. Lovecraft on occasion. The cast is decent too, with nice performances from the reliable Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill, as well as turns from the underrated Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs. I hope that an extended director's cut may surface one day and add more to the experience."
tt0119081,6.0,"Event Horizon (1997) *** (out of 4) Dark and sometimes disturbing mix of sci-fi and horror about the spaceship Event Horizon, which went missing shortly after its mission. Seven years later it reemerges so a rescue crew goes after it trying to figure out where it's been the entire time. I saw EVENT HORIZON when it was first released and really couldn't understand why it gained so many negative reviews. There's no question that the film contains some flaws but it's also a rather ambitious film that relies just as much on its story than just the special effects. I thought director Paul Anderson did a fantastic job early on really making the viewer feel uneasy. There's a brief line where a crew member talks about how far they are from safety and this scene perfectly builds up a rather dark tension because you realize that these people really are on their own with no one to help them. The entire atmosphere of the film is incredibly dark and while I'm not going to give anything away, what the story attempts to do with where the ship has gone was rather unique and I think that for the most part it works. Now, if you've ever heard of this film then you know about the various issues it ran into during the test screenings. There's been talk of a director's cut, which I think might help out many of the flaws. The story takes us to a rather dark direction but it just seems as if something is missing. There are a few questions that need to be answered and there are a few things that don't make much sense but perhaps these were forced to be left on the cutting room floor. If so, hopefully we can see the complete version at some point. Another thing that works here are the extremely strong performances with Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Kathleen Quinlan and Joely Richardson delivering great work. The special effects are also another major plus including an incredibly beautiful opening sequence as well as the effects really making you feel as if you're in space the entire time. Some have been critical of some of the graphic and bloody violence but I thought it actually played well into the story and didn't take away from anything. As it stands, EVENT HORIZON is a rather brave but flawed film but hopefully a complete version will give us a better look at what it was really trying to do."

tt9114286,6.0,"I am conflicted with this film and with Marvel.Let's review the good first. There is a heartfelt tribute to T'Challa and obviously to the actor who played him. The emotions shown feel real and manage to move. The performances are good in this regard. Angela Bassett stands out above the rest.I'm not one to oppose the replacement of Atlantis by Talokan, as this gives another excellent excuse to show some content that derives from universal culture in gigantic products like the MCU movies. Namor is an excellent addition to the ranks of Marvel superheroes immediately showing how powerful he is and what he is capable of.The action sequences are entertaining, as Marvel has already accustomed us.The wardrobe is also something to value in this film. There is a great effort and meaning behind each of the suits, which successfully try to mix the different cultures with the new times full of technology. This makes an excellent contribution to character design.Now what I didn't like about the movie. The entire story feels too light and if you think about it, pretty ridiculous. Namor's motivations don't match his plans or his actions throughout the film. Marvel Studios again falls flat when writing and developing their villains. It all feels like a mere excuse for the characters to clash. There is nothing really of weight in the story, except for the death of T'Challa, which is also not well used, abusing the drama whenever they can.I liked Riri Williams' introduction, but not Ironheart's introduction. The story devoured her as a secondary character and was relegated to the background when in fact the beginning of the film gives her much more importance.The pacing of the movie is inconsistent. It's pretty monotonous until the action scenes, which are good, but short. Sometimes, there is too much information happening too fast without giving the opportunity to fully appreciate each sequence and each character involved.Finally, the effects are good, as expected, but something is wrong with the composition of the cities. Both Wakanda and Talokan have a contrast and color problem that prevents them from being fully appreciated.The final battle scenario also seems pretty bad to me.Overall, the movie is entertaining if you just want to have fun with fights and visuals, but I think it's about time Marvel got serious about their movies and realized that adults are also consuming superhero movies."
tt9114286,6.0,"I never thought the original Black Panther was anywhere near being the best solo Marvel movie, but I did enjoy it and T'Challa's character throughout his appearances. With that being said, when Chadwick Boseman sadly passed, I accepted that this franchise was doomed. I always believed that recasting T'Challa was the only way to go. It would've been incredibly hard to find a good replacement, but the character is very important to the Marvel universe. It is also simply too soon to pass the mantle of Black Panther on. When they confirmed he wouldn't be recast, I felt like it was a big mistake narratively.Now does Wakanda Forever handle the death of T'Challa/Boseman well? Absolutely! Being able to respect the legacy of the actor while also metatextually connecting the event to an in-universe tragedy is definitely one of the movie's standout features. Regardless, I feel like the movie is a little too reliant on the audience being impacted by Boseman's passing.Don't get me wrong, the fully silent opening gave me chills. They incorporated the death beautifully and honorably, but the result is what feels like two movies in one. You can clearly tell the original script was written before Chadwick's death. I really respect Coogler's decision to not recast, but I still wish T'Challa and Namor got to cross paths.My issues spring not from the T'Challa-related parts of the film, but from how the rest feels lacking without his presence. I don't think Shuri works as the protagonist. She was a fun (yet underdeveloped) carefree tech nerd in the original movie and here she takes a 180 to being reserved and bitter. The changes to her character were perhaps necessary for this story, but it doesn't make them good changes for her. Some don't match her at all and her vengeful arc is just T'Challa's from Civil War with a less fitting character. She never struck me as someone who would willingly become the Black Panther and there isn't much impact when she does anyway.Ramonda is a pleasant surprise in this movie. Her monologues are insane. Angela Bassett deserves all the credit she's been receiving. However, Okoye is the only character I felt really connected to and she is stupidly sidelined a third into the movie. She would've enhanced the film a lot if given more screen time. So would've M'Baku, who is completely wasted. Between them and W'Kabi, who is fully absent, we have three characters connected to T'Challa and it isn't explored how his death affected any of them personally. This is one of many missed opportunities that came with trying to focus the movie on both Talokan and T'Challa's death.Some of the action scenes are awesome and some drag. As to be expected from Danai Gurira, Okoye's fight scenes are the tensest we've gotten from Marvel all year.Namor himself is a pretty good villain. In a similar fashion to Killmonger, his actor sells the character for me despite his viewpoints being completely ridiculous. They somehow managed to adapt his crazy mutant powers to live-action in a cool way. Changing his kingdom from Atlantis to Talokan ended up being a really cool idea, even though the place and its people needed more elaboration. There are many more cool concepts they could've explored with the Aztec roots. Hopefully they are saving more about the civilization, the people's powers, and their technology for a Namor project.Ironheart is an even more underdeveloped part of the movie, undoubtedly to save content for her upcoming show. Her character is just as dumb and not relatable as I expected her to be and her suit looks awful. A Black Panther movie didn't feel like the right place to introduce an Iron Man ripoff.Also, Ross's entire storyline felt weird and unneeded. It's only included to add awkward colonizer jokes and set up future MCU films. If he and Ironheart were removed, there would definitely be enough room to have included more from the aforementioned underutilized characters.By the latter half of this movie, the pacing really starts to drag. I've complained recently about Marvel movies like Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder being way too short, but this film had no reason to be 2 hours and 40 minutes and feel like it's over 3 hours. There's so much downtime between the action that when the final battle starts, the movie has already overstayed its welcome.The things I'm disappointed they didn't include or flesh out have no excuse to not be here or be better implemented considering how aggressively long and slow the film is.So this definitely isn't a bad movie per se, but it's not fantastic either. It's very bold but very flawed with iffy decisions on what to prioritize and how to structure this challenging project. I was pretty disappointed when I first saw it, but there's some great stuff sprinkled throughout. The lack of T'Challa, awkward pacing, and wasted opportunities easily made it worse than the first movie to me."
tt9114286,6.0,"Let's start with the good points - this film doesn't try to be all comedy and spectacle, like the recent Dr Strange 2 and Thor 4. In fact, there is almost zero comedy at all.It does try to bring some drama, and to make some points about the responsibility of nations to use their wealth, resources and technology for global benefit, rather than national advancement.Namor is different to the comics, but once I got past the initial differences, I think the portrayal was a good one. He isn't a one-dimensional villain, his people are descended from the Mayans, and he has proper motivation.But the film has a lot of problems. Firstly, the pacing is all over the place - it should be at least half an hour shorter. The comic-book science is paper thin (Shuri extracts DNA from plant fibres on a bracelet that has been underwater for 400 years, but cannot do the same from the recently dead plant in her lab). Shuri takes a spear right through her stomach and out of her back, but gets over it after a short breather. The Wakandan ship is breached from undersea, tilts over by 45 degrees and then the next scene it is upright and apparently seaworthy again. The fact that Namor's people take mortal wounds but get up again is never explained.And then there is still my biggest problem with Wakanda. Both Black Panther films promote the idea that Wakanda is a Utopian society, both technology and socially. Yet they still choose their leader by who is best at beating up other challengers.I think there was a missed opportunity here. Namor would be more likely to say ""join us, or if not, don't get in our way"", as he plans to attack the rest of the surface world. This would present Wakanda with a far more interesting moral dilemma - standby by and watch untold millions die, or utilise their resources and technology to aid the nations who have been trying to rob them."
tt9114286,6.0,"Sorry, but this was boring. Mind-numbing boring. Sleep-inducing boring. ""Are we there,yet?""-boring.Dang, I liked Mr. Bozeman and they pay some propper respect to his character in the first couple of minutes and it really hits you in the feels but after that we are let known that Wakanda have mastered the technology of exposition dialogue. If that is their main achievement then I say we forget vibranium and let them slink back behind their stealth shield and call it a day.They could have done so much with this movie and show Africa as a vibrant place full of ideas and hope in the face of many problems. Maybe explore Ubuntu philosophy, or visual art. Unfortunately, Wakandan culture is reduced to a song&dance number for the day-trip tourists in cinema seats.This was a missed opportunity and almost a missed movie if not for a good double espresso I had before it."
tt9114286,6.0,"As the last film in the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) proves that there was no plan for this phase other than to clean up the remains of the Infinity War saga. To its credit, though, Wakanda Forever was burdened with finding an in-universe replacement for the titular Black Panther after the untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman. However, considering how most of Phase 4 was passing the mantle from one hero to the next generation, it fits well within this theming.There's a line in Avengers: Endgame (2019) where Naka (Lupita Nyong'o) states that Wakanda is aware of an anomaly on the ocean floor near their country and that they were handling it. This throwaway line was likely played for laughs, but it's peculiar how Wakanda was woefully unprepared for the invasion of their land by underwater enemies, even though they clearly knew about it three years ago. Phase 4 of the MCU has highlighted how difficult it is to maintain continuity in a franchise as huge as it has become.Even though Marvel has introduced new characters in movies outside their own standalone works since the early Phases, I would have liked something more dedicated to introducing Ironheart (Dominique Thorne) considering how influential Iron Man was to the MCU. I also would have appreciated action sequences that weren't so dark or hard to follow, because I can't honestly recall any of them that happened in this movie. Overall, I felt the end of the MCU Phase 4 was average-which aligns with the MCU Phase 4 as a whole. Here's to hoping the next Phase actually goes somewhere.Phase 4 MCU's average movie to end an average phase, I give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 3.0 stars out of 5."
tt9114286,6.0,"The only reason this is scoring a five from me is because of the good CGI, magnificent costumes and wonderful scene shots. Sadly none of that could save this terrible story which the director made it look like he was clueless as what to do with it. Not his fault really as it was woefully lacking in worth, tension, excitement, interest or quality in any way. My personal thoughts as I sat watching it (fighting hard with myself not to just switch it off) was that if they had no creative outstanding story for a sequel then Hollywood should have stopped just trying to cash in on what they thought would be a successful film franchise; whereas instead they made one of the most disappointing rubbish sequels of a film.They spoilt the memory of a great Black Panther and this will most likely do so bad at the box office that there may not be a third film being made in the future. Its the typical cash in if you can, from people involved in the putting together of the fans heroes, from directors and studios who don't give a toss about the Marvel/DC heroes and heroines; they are there too see if they can amass better wages and high end film contracts.In straight forward simplistic words, ""This was a bloody disgrace and only did damage to a superhero that has never had enough exposure!"
tt9114286,6.0,"I just got out of Black PantherI found it pretty underwhelming. It's a better put together movie than both Thor: Love & Thunder and Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness, and there is no sense it was butchered in the editing room, like both of those movies. That said I probably had more fun with those two.The Chadwick Bosman stuff was touching, but I expected more. Disappointed not to see at least, Bucky there. When I heard there was a cameo, I expected it to be someone at the funeral. I DID NOT see that cameo coming. I thought the Marvel logo was a nice touch.Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett are both good, but I'm not sure where this Oscar nomination talk is coming from. Then again, I didn't think Black Panther should have got a nomination for Best Picture, so she could get one. Winston Duke was a bit wasted as Umkaku, disappointed by what he did at the endThere is no reason for it to be as long as it is. I was bored a few times. I was especially bored during the story between Martin Freeman and Julia Drefuss, it was really weak and unnecessary. Was it just there to put some white people in it? I didn't like the scientist girl, she irritated me and had awful dialogue. Some of the CGI/Green screen work was not the best, too.I can safely say, with the exception of Spider-Man: No Way Home, nothing from Phase 4 will be rewatched, never mind find its way into my collection.Overall I found it OK."
tt9114286,6.0,"This film had some great stuff in it, there's no doubt of that, but I felt it was overall weak. I can't imagine how hard it was for everyone in the film to come back without a lead, and most importantly, their friend. Chadwick's passing is unbelievably sad but it did leave a gap for Marcel to fill, and they could have done it so well. But they didn't.Firstly, the good. All the emotional scenes were well-scripted and well-acted, and I have to commend Angela Bassett and Letita Wright for their fantastic acting. I never cry in the cinema but this film really had me going because it felt from the heart in some scenes, and I am sure it was.I also enjoyed the costumes - wow were they beautiful. The only one I didn't like was the Midnight Angels (or whatever they were called). They didn't feel like they fit. Some of the fighting was great as per.The rest of the film felt slow, boring almost. I've just come from the cinema and I am struggling to remember much of it.The story was gaping with holes and so much was skipped over with little explanation. The beginning when T'Challa dies felt cold and rushed. That should have been the pivotal moment for the story, but it was brushed over. However, maybe it was too hard for the cast and crew to linger on.The Talokan/Atlantis story was odd to me and felt so disconnected from Wakanda. I didn't enjoy that storyline. They could have made it so much better.Anyway, it was enjoyable and I'll maybe watch it again. But I won't rush to do that."
tt9114286,6.0,"If there is one thing BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER gets right is the reverence and respect it gives to the memory of Chadwick Boseman, taken from us way too soon after making the role of T'Challa, the Black Panther, totally and uniquely his own. From the opening montage, where he is the only Marvel superhero whose visage we see, onward throughout the film, his shadow looms over the characters, story, and action. We feel his missing presence in every scene. It is clear that director Ryan Coogler, the returning members of the cast from the first film, and the producers where dealt a very difficult hand when crafting a sequel and finding a way forward. Perhaps it was an impossible chore, perhaps there was no way they could have succeeded under these conditions, but the resulting film was just a disappointment as far as I'm concerned. In the absence Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER fills the void by elevating the principle female characters to center stage, and having them face off against a threat from Prince Namor, the leader of an undersea race heretofore unknown to the MCU over the issue of vibranium, an all purpose element found in abundance in Wakanda (and the source of its technological superiority), and now for the first time, discovered outside the African nation on the ocean's floor. Coveted by other nations, this sets off a conflict when Namor demands that Wakanda do his dirty work for him, and eliminate the threat from the surface world. I don't fault the actresses-Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and the indomitable Angela Bassett-who totally give it their all, and clearly bring it. But the script goes heavy on the themes of female empowerment, anti-colonialism, and Afro-futurism that earn praise from mainstream film critics and pop culture commentators at the expense of the tension and conflict, and even humor that made the first film something special. A cameo by Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger in a dream sequence only served as a further reminder of what WAKANDA FOREVER was missing. At a running time of more than two and half hours, WAKANDA FOREVER works way too hard to generate some heat with its thin plot. Namor is played by Tenoch Huerta as another antagonist motivated by past injustice, so he never really feels like a Big Bad. And those wings on his heels look silly. Tweaking Namor's origin to make him and his undersea kingdom have a connection to the ancient Mayans, who escape Spanish oppression by ingesting vibranium, works, but giving all of them but Namor blue skin invokes unflattering comparisons to AVATAR (it didn't help that the trailer for James Cameron's latest epic played in the theater before WAKANDA FOREVER). There are some great action set pieces, something the MCU does well, but the resolution of the final battle between Princess Shuri and Namor is underwhelming. There are a few cameos, and I liked the interplay between Martin Freeman and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. And was I the only one who thought Richard Schiff was just playing an older version of his character from THE WEST WING when he shows up as the Secretary of State?There is a single mid-credits scene that reveals that the legacy of T'Challa is more than what it first appeared, something I thought the movie was leading toward all along. It opens up a host of possibilities for future BLACK PANTHER films, but I was further disappointed that there is no hint as to where Phase IV of the MCU is heading. That was one of my complaints with THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER and I think the loyal fans are getting restless. Namor is a character with a lot of history with The Fantastic Four, and this would have been an opportunity to give us some idea of how and when they might be introduced into the main MCU. Namor also mentions that he is a mutant, one of the first ones ever in the Marvel universe, raising the possibility of the X-Men showing up-how great would it have been if he'd been approached by Magneto in another after credits scene seeing how their back stories have similarities. Will just have to wait and see what the next Ant-Man movie shows us."
tt9114286,6.0,"First of all, RIP to Chadwick Boseman. They really did do a good tribute to him in this movie through various devices. Performances when reflecting his death felt real and convincing, probably because there was little ""acting"" involved. Losing a franchise star is really a tough blow. While I felt Boseman's absence, I don't think not all of the movie's downfalls are linked to his absence.Biggest head-scratching moments were for me was poor writing mainly from some of the tactical choices. The whole conflict stems from the existence of Riri (soon to be Ironheart), who built a Vibranium detector for a school project. Apparently, she's the only one in the world who can do that. Aside from that ridiculous premise, I thought Ironheart's introduction to the MCU was not bad (I still think the suit is ugly). She was likable enough and I think she has potential. I do worry about the overlap between her and Shuri because while they do have good chemistry, they are such similar characters. Anyways, this detector triggers a cascade of events where Shuri and Riri are taken to Talokan. First of all, getting rid of Riri will not do anything because the technology is no longer in her hands alone. Also, Wakandans have very little reason to protect her other than the fact she's a great scientist. I was also baffled that key hostages like Shuri and Riri could escape Taloka with the help of one person DURING an ongoing negotiation. A rookie foreign affairs mistake. It was not even a hostage situation. It was closer to an aggressive invitation. This was literally the cause of the all-out war and I thought it was just poorly written how they started that conflict. And at that point, the entire war felt so meaningless and stakeless because it wasn't clear why they were fighting. It still isn't clear why Talokans wanted to go to war with Wakanda. So whatever came after that became difficult to love. Ramonda's death was also quite preventable in my opinion. The queen with no protection and left to drown. Like why does Riri matter so much to Ramonda that she sacrificed herself to save her? It almost felt like an artificial plot device to pump up Ironheart's value as a a character. And Shuri does not blame Riri once or show any animosity toward her even though she was an indirect cause of her mother's death? Seemed a little strange unless she didn't know what happened.There were positive things too. I thought Taloka's story was interesting and was well introduced. Loved Namor as a character and his action scenes were powerful enough. The performances were solid across the board, especially Ramonda and Namor shined. I thought some of the battle sequences were interesting despite being imperfect (really bad CG moments here and there). Overall, it was rather inconsistent with really cool spear fighting scenes and just generic scenes. The whales really did surprise me. I thought the locations were well chosen. I really like their portrayal of Wakanda and Taloka in general so that's a plus. I enjoyed how they incorporated the idea of the oppressed (the Mayans) versus oppressor like they did in Black Panther 1. But again, this should only unite Taloka and Wakanda together rather than fight against each other.I'd also like to comment on Shuri. She has now become the official franchise star with the death of Ramonda and T'challa. My overall impression that while she has the potential to be the franchise but it's a tough transition. She's been known as the geek scientist sister but now she's the black panther and the sole protector of Wakanda. That's a big jump for both the audience and the character. That type of transition, fueled mostly by grief and revenge, should usually take multiple movies or a series to hash out but that was not an option for the production team. So while I still am not used to the transition, I think they were handled as well as they could be. Her characterization was complex and meaningful enough. A far better experience than the most recent MCU movie.In the end, phase 4 has been a let-down for most fans with a notable exception. I was disappointed that this movie was not able to be part of that exception."
tt9114286,6.0,"Wakanda Forever tells the story of how Wakanda got a new Black Panther in a war with the Atlantis (or whoever they were). The film's best parts are the underwater beings who attack Wakanda. Prince Namor is really cool and the actor who plays him has great screen presence. His underwater people are a lot of fun to see in action.The film's big problem is that the lead is insufferable and annoying. She doesn't have a lot of screen charisma, makes a much better sidekick than a main protagonist, and overall it's not that interesting that she ever becomes Black Panther. You never really root for her I this film.Also, this film is mostly boring acting and writing repeating information we already know and everyone being depressed all the time. It's hard to get into a movie that is two hours and forty minutes of this.Probably, it should have just been called Namor and have Wakanda be the side characters."
tt9114286,6.0,"At this point, Marvel is getting too saturated for its own good. The movie's beginning and the end is good, but the middle is too slow and crammed with corporate-mandated plot requirements, so much so that the writers didn't know what to do.I really feel that this is the product of unrealistic corporate deadlines, leading to incohesive and plot-hole ridden story, subpar CGI, and morally problematic characters that we are supposed to think are heroes. I don't think Marvel is really taking the time to quality check.To start, the villain is not really likeable or unlikeable. The villain just sort of exists. At least the first Black Panther movie had a villain that was likeable, carried by the performance of Michael B. Jordan. Another point of weakness is how Ironheart was crammed into the plot as required by Disney. As they tried to cram her in, plot points began to crack (which will not be mentioned here due to spoilers). The story is not cohesive. The third, and perhaps the biggest, point of weakness is the action scenes.Action scenes, you would think, would be the centerpieces of superhero movies, right? But Marvel's sweat-shop CGI studios seem to lack the motivation or at least the time to render quality products, not to mention how the choreography is sub-par as well. At the end, Black Panther 2's action scenes are forgettable.It is mildly entertaining enough to be an airplane or a steam-at-home movie, but this is by no means a great movie."
tt9114286,6.0,"I was let down with this one. Action was sub par. Tried to hard to be ""emotionally relevant"". I understand the tribute to Chadwick, but this whole movie was kind of a downer. Way too goodie two shoes. This was almost... almost, as bad as Wonder Woman 2. I don't understand why they had to drag this out for almost three hours. The underwater city was completely non visible because it was so dark. It was also like they were a primitive people. Playing with rocks? No machines? And really can't live out of water. One well placed nuke and the whole civilization is gone. Obviously not a lot of thought went into this one but at least we got some more female lead characters out of it."

The storyline follows the infamous voyage of the Demeter from Romania to London with a mysterious cargo. As strange things start happening around the ship the crew starts poking around the cargo and find a ""stowaway"" that warns them about an unworldly entity they must escape. Will the crew take the warning seriously or fall victim to whatever is haunting the ship?This movie is directed by André Øvredal (Troll Hunter) and stars Corey Hawkins (Straight Outta Compton), Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones), David Dastmalchian (The Suicide Squad), Aisling Franciosi (Game of Thrones) and Jon Jon Briones (Ratched).This storyline, settings and special effects had so much potential. The plot is well set up, the attire and props are perfect, and the cast was well selected. The CGI used to create Dracula and his face were outstanding. There's some really creepy moments in here and some worthwhile jump scares. The kill scenes were intense, brutal and have nice gore and blood splatter. The transformation scenes are good too. However, the movie does run a bit long, I didn't ""love"" the ending and the entire film I felt like there was something missing and I couldn't quite put my finger on it.Overall, this is a unique and solid addition to the Dracula universe but leaves you with a feeling it was missing something that keep it from being outstanding. I would score this a 6-6.5/10 and recommend seeing it once."
tt1001520,6.0,"'The Last Voyage of the Demeter' ended up being a lot better than I expected. I haven't seen a good vampire film in such a long time that I was really starting to suspect the genre had very little left to offer. Naturally then, I went into this film with rather low expectations. The film pleasantly surprised me though.The film is very well made. We start with a scene from later in the movie. I'm not always the biggest fan of this, but in this case it was needed as there was a lengthy time of set-up at the beginning of the film, where if there wasn't promise of excitement to come, it could've lost some audience members.Once the horror begins it was reasonably effective. The ship in the middle of the ocean is a truly great setting for a horror movie. There are a lot of night scenes too (vampire movies naturally always have a lot of those) which added to the suspenseful atmosphere.And outside of the horror there was some decent stuff going on too. Some character's who were actually fairly likeable (unheard of in a modern horror film, right?). Also some very well written dialogue helped flesh things out and kept the less interesting scenes afloat.The film wasn't afraid to break some boundaries too. Often in films like this you can tell at the start all the characters that are 100% going to be safe, but that wasn't the case here. I was pleasantly surprised by that.All in all this did about as well with the concept as could've been expected. It's not a film I will likely ever watch again. But it passed two hours for me in reasonably enjoyable fashion. 6.5/10."
tt1001520,6.0,"I enjoyed The Last Voyage of the Demeter. It's a cool stand-alone movie in a subgenre I frequently enjoy. There are a bunch of cool scenes and powerful moments. It does a good job creating unique characters. The performances are fairly good all around, with the standout being Liam Cunningham of GoT fame.The movie also has a bunch of issues. I couldn't understand a lot of the dialogue. This is partly due to the accents, but more to do with sound mixing. I wasn't as engaged as I should have been. And not everything works.But the biggest thing holding it back is that it's slow. It takes a while to get going. It's a full hour into the movie before you see anything. Now this could have been enjoyable if we didn't know what to expect. We would have been wondering what's happening, what's causing all of this. But of course the trailers give it away.And even for people who avoid trailers like me and went in not knowing, the movie tells you in text right at the start. Instead of filling you with curiosity, you already know and are just waiting to get to it. And even after that, it doesn't pick up the pace all that much.I still had a pretty good time with this movie, although I don't really see myself watching it again.

tt1001520,5.0,"This movie eliminates the familiar. Mina, Van Helsing, Harker, Renfield. Not even mentioned. Instead we are treated to the Demeter and it's ill fated final voyage. Based on just one chapter in from the book, and not even a full chapter. The movie explores the horror that the crew felt in facing evil in it's purest form.That familiar aspect of Dracula is also eliminated. This is not a sophisticated man of high society. He's not charming. He doesn't wear fancy clothes. He doesn't ooze sex appeal. He's a monster, nothing else. It's a refreshing take on a legend that has almost become cliche.Unfortunately, a good idea is often spoiled by details and this movie is no exception. The characters are undeveloped and shallow. As a result, you don't care about them. They are seen by the viewer exactly the same way Dracula sees them. As food, not people.I'm guessing that's why they added a child and a woman to the cast. To get an emotional response out of the audience. But, there is no reason to care about them either. Even the dog is boring. You know things are bad when a movie kills a dog and no one cares.I applaud the fresh approach, I just wish the execution had been better."

tt1014759,6.0,"I attended the Cast and Crew screening on Sunday, in Leicester Square, with high hopes for this film as it's without doubt the most exciting job I've had. This was my first feature experience, and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.But, even as someone with a lot of time for his films, and a pre-existing bias, I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free-floating, evocative trip. Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his ""Tideland"" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem, that Tim Burton, while he is still making decent films, has been a long way off special for some time now.6/10 (if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5), but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids, I'm sure it'll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved, and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film (although I got this one for free...)"
tt1014759,6.0,"If ever there were a working example of the word ""whimsical,"" it would be the works of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll), i.e.: ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass."" The stories, stuffed with clever word play, non-sequiturs, train-of-thought chaos and general silliness, are not exactly funny, so much as just being playfully amusing. The reader – like Alice – takes a trip of wayward, unpredictable imagination. Tim Burton's film version (or re-imaging) of Carroll's tales likely will never be accused of being whimsical. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find a trace of whimsy in any line of dialog or overwrought image. Burton's film, while certainly being visually stunning, is also dark, and at times just plain depressing.Burton has said that he never felt emotionally connected to the ""Wonderland"" stories because they seemed like they were just about a young girl wondering around meeting unusual characters. Which is exactly what they were about. Their unpredictable nature and inexplicable logic is what made them what they were: engaging, if somewhat high-toned, nonsense. Burton and his screenwriter Linda Woolverton have tried to tame the material by boxing it into clichés and a tiresomely predictable plot. He expertly keeps the visuals more or less right – though he has made it all look gloomier and creepier – but the literary essence of the original material has been tossed aside to make room for little that might be considered funny and even less that might pass for fun.The story begins with Alice, as a little girl, interrupting her father's business meeting to tell him she has had another in a series of recurring dreams, presumably about Wonderland, and she asks him if the dreams are a sign she is going mad. A few joking and reassuring words temporarily puts her mind at rest, but the film reveals itself; the dream world of the little girl is now to be treated as a nightmare world that may be caused by or will result in mental illness. The story jumps a head over a decade later where Alice's widowed mother hopes to marry her off in an arranged union with an upper class twit. Will Alice wed the twit? Duh! The end is obvious – as is the heavy-handed feminism jammed into the story.Soon Alice (Mia Wasikowska) falls down another rabbit hole and lands in Wonderland – or is that Underland? But Wonderland is now a bleak and ramshackle place, with most everybody living in fear of the tyrannical Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Alice eventually discovers that she is the chosen one, expected to help the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) save Wonderland from the bombastic Red Queen by battling the ferocious Jabberwock. Instead of a bewildered outsider lost in a strange world, Alice is now a reluctant messiah. Few of the oddball characters from Carroll's books have been retained, apparently to make room for an expanded role for Burton's favorite muse, Johnny Depp as The Mad Hatter. Depp takes up far too much of the story time for a character who looks far more interesting then he really is. Worse, a hint of a possible romance between the Hatter and Alice rings false.This ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't for kids. Of course, the same could be said for the original books, what with their obscure literary allusions and now-dated popular references. Whether for commercial reasons or a sheer lack of imagination, the film is yet another childhood fantasy that has been re-written into an adult horror film. Like the disastrous THE WIZ and Steven Spielberg's overblown HOOK, a gentle and benignly scary fairy tale has been twisted around in order to supposedly explore adult themes. And as Disney did this once before, back in 1985, when they made RETURN TO OZ, a horrible and unwarranted sequel to THE WIZARD OF OZ: they've taken a colorful, playfully perplexing fantasy world and turned it into something unpleasant and uninviting. There's nothing particularly wrong with taking an old literary classic and looking at it through fresh eyes, if the look is truly fresh, but remains true to the original -- as, say, Burton did with SLEEPY HOLLOW.Like the recent SHERLOCK HOLMES, this ALICE an exercise in dumbing down. Just as the former film takes Holmes and de-intellectualizes him, making him into a rough-and-tumble superhero, the later indulges in victim feminism, turning Alice from being a precocious, adventurous child into a sorrowful, reactive woman. Here Burton and screenwriter Woolverton become regressive feminists, changing a wide-eyed, curious little girl into a repressed, depressed and distressed woman who ""takes control of her dream,"" dons armor and becomes a warrior and ends up being empowered.And what does this empowerment lead to? She becomes a businesswoman. So much for intellectual whimsy."
tt1014759,6.0,"Adding a little bit of a background story and a few more characters to Alice's adventures didn't do as much as i thought it would for the story. Truthfully i wanted to love this movie, I'm a huge Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp fan. But this just didn't do it for me. I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However, Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful, but at the same time its no masterpiece, for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice, however if you want a great story and compelling acting, you might want to check out something else, because this isn't the movie you're looking for."
tt1014759,5.0,"It is still worth the high price of the 3-D admission to see some of the amazing animation and design, but the writing is extremely boring and clumsy, and the performances cannot save it. Too many liberties were taken with the originals here, and in no way improve upon them, it only barely resembles either of Carroll's books in theme and some specific scenes. There are some ""Disney moments"" that literally set off a gag reflex as well.The animation is quite stunning and wonderful though, as is the costuming and set design (in so much as there were sets and not just green screens, I'm sure SOME actual props were used). There are some clever elements that owe only to good visual design and direction I'm sure, as the only other clever bits in the dialogue were the parts directly lifted from the originals."
tt1014759,5.0,"Alice in Wonderland is another big budget exercise in eccentricity for eccentricity's sake from the team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, an overindulgent and unnecessary retelling of the Lewis Carroll tale full of the director's trademark Gothic grandeur and featuring another kooky performance from the top billed star designed to further his appeal with disaffected loners and weirdos (don't be offended: I include myself in those categories).Help is also on hand from pretty but wooden Mia Wasikowska as Alice, assorted well regarded thesps, a handful of cult names from the world of British TV, and of course, Burton's wife, Helena Bonham-Carter, whose weak impression of Queenie from Black Adder II is sadly the best performance of the whole film.The clumsy narrative, which focuses heavily on elements from the nonsense poem The Jabberwocky, rarely engages the viewer in a satisfactory manner, achieving neither suspense, tension, excitement or, perhaps most notably, a sense of wonder; instead, the story plays second fiddle to the polished CGI visuals, which offer up the usual, tired, trippy imagery associated with the stories, but fail to either add anything new or make full use of the 3D technology (Wonderland looks positively flat in comparison to Cameron's alien world in Avatar).Not quite as bad as Burton's re-imagining of Planet of the Apes (thank heavens), but still a long way from the genius on display in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks (hey, I like it, so there!), Alice in Wonderland must have looked like the perfect project for all involved but the finished product is unlikely to have anyone grinning like the Cheshire cat.Oh, and anyone who that thinks Crispin Glover needs digitally altering to look creepy is seriously misguided."
tt0101862,5.0,"There are some touching bits of sentimentality here, as a dad (Steve Martin) tries to cope with his 22-year-old daughter (Kimberley Williams) returning from a trip to Rome to announce she's getting married. The flashbacks to her childhood in his mind, his trying to reconcile with the fact that he's no longer the man in his little girl's life, and his conflicted feelings about the young man who will be his son-in-law tug the heartstrings, even when the film is constantly endangering those feelings by being too cheesy. Diane Keaton is a welcome addition to the cast as the mother, and she does what she can, but it's a pretty shallow role (after all, this ain't Parents of the Bride).The biggest issue, however, is that too much of the film is devoted to the out-of-control wedding spending, all at the hands of an effete wedding coordinator (Martin Short). I don't know what accent Short was going for here, but his character wasn't at all funny to me, and quickly grew tiresome to watch. Plus, you essentially have wealthy folks in San Marino (living in gigantic house, running a factory, tooling around in a convertible) worrying about the wedding costs and how it will appear to their new in-laws from Bel-Air (who own a mansion with servants, have a shocking amount of money even in their checking account, etc).It's just a lighthearted comedy and not everything needs to be self-aware, but there just wasn't a lot of charm in Martin's character trying to reign in expenses while Short's absurdly ratcheted them up, with Keaton and Williams just nodding their heads. Other elements of comedy, like Martin being attacked by the in-laws Dobermans and falling into a pool, or the little kids driving cars as valets, just seemed lame to me. There is a feeling at the center of this which is undeniable, but the script and direction needed defter hands."

Were the worst storyline I've ever witnessed-completely messed up the movie in a huge way-assassins unable to do their job while some con artist and her lover are suddenly amazing action heroes dealing with villains in disdain--pathetic-twist at end doesn't help recover the really bad 25 mins before the end."

tt9893250,6.0,"Watched 'I Care a Lot' some weeks back with a lot of anticipation. Really like Peter Dinklage and Rosamund Pike as actors, likewise with Dianne Wiest. All three have been fantastic in other things. The premise was a great and interesting one, if very nasty and one that would make anybody unsettled. The film is also in a genre that has always appealed to me and looked great from the advertising. Even the overwhelming negative ratings here didn't dissuade me from seeing 'I Care a Lot'.After watching, 'I Care a Lot' is to me not near as bad as has been said here and not deserving of so many of the lowest rating votes that indicates no redeeming qualities, which actually goes against what most of those that have given it that rating have said. Having said that, 'I Care a Lot' did disappoint me and certainly wanted to like so much more. It is a film of two halves, one being great and the other being pretty bad. Uneven is a good word to sum it up.'I Care a Lot' does have a number of good things. The best thing about it is Pike, on killer form as a character that manages to be even more amoral than her Amy Dunne in 'Gone Girl'. She really did make me feel uneasy, just as her role required. Dinklage has never been more sinister than here and his chemistry with Pike in the second half really chills. Eiza Gonzalez has allure and intensity in her acting, her chemistry with Pike sizzles and personally don't think what it represented was laid on too thick. Was also impressed by the always great Wiest, who is moving as the one rootable character in the film.The visuals are stylish and have an audacious thriller action look, almost looking at times like it was homaging spaghetti westerns. The music is very atmosphere-filled and pulsates with energy without being too over the top. The script in the first half is taut, darkly comic/satiric at times and often chilling, effectively making one feel uncomfortable at the nastiness that goes on. It even has a voice over eerily reminiscent of 'Gone Girl's' ""Cool Girl"" monologue.First half is truly great. Fast-paced, intriguing, tense and appropriately makes one feel uncomfortable and scared, this kind of deceit does happen and the film does very well at showing the full horrors of it and how easily it can be fallen for. The direction in the first half was clever stylistically and had the right amount of tension.Sadly, 'I Care a Lot's' second half is nowhere near as good and actually felt like a different and vastly inferior film. It was mostly pretty bad, and at its worst it was close to awful and saved only by the acting, the chemistry between Pike and Dinklage, their performances and the visuals. The tautness is lost and the intrigue and tension go too and the trashiness goes well overboard. Evident in some truly implausible and very strange moments , and it feels over-stretched (this could have been twenty minutes shorter easily) and downright silly. The murder attempt especially has to be seen to be believed and not in a good way.Also overkill was the bumbling ineptitude of the mafia, while the dialogue loses its flow and becomes cheesy and self-indulgent. The direction also suffers in quality and became dumb done for the paycheck action thriller-like. While the very end satisfies, what happens comes straight out of nowhere and is rushed through.Concluding, started off so well but the second half was a real let-down. 6/10."
tt9893250,6.0,"Marla Grayson (Rosamund Pike) uses the legal system to get assigned as the guardian to vulnerable and unsuspecting seniors. She claims to care but in reality, it's a legally sanctioned scam to kidnap these perfectly functioning seniors and milk their net worth. Marla and her lover henchwoman Fran (Eiza González) have their sights set on their next victim, Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest). At first, she seems to be a cherry prospect and then, her Russian mob boss son (Peter Dinklage) shows up.This movie takes an outlier premise and pushes it slightly into unreal territories. I'm willing to buy the general premise of elder abuse but there are problematic overreach. It could be solved if the judge had been bribed and the seniors have no family to fight for them. I can't see any judge willing to keep these seniors from their immediate family. These issues make the main premise problematic. The Russians are also problematic for a different reason. They are generally stupid and aren't doing reasonable things.I love Dean Ericson going to Marla's office which is probably the best scene in the movie but it's really stupid to not at least forge Jennifer's signature on a retainer agreement. Apparently, he's fine with being a mob lawyer threatening to kill people but forgery is too illegal for him. The first target for the mob is obviously the doctor. They have to force her to recant her diagnosis before faking her suicide. In fact, they should force her to out her fraud with Marla as the reason for her suicide. Instead, they decide to shoot up an old folks' home and the security guard shoots first. There is no reason to go nuclear right off the bat and alert the feds which is the last thing they want. Also, why would the security guard shoot first and am I to believe that the guy gets taken down by a bag over his head? All of this is a little silly in a bad way. Later, Fran should be dead. There's no point not killing her off. A gas explosion would not suggest suicide when her face is beaten to a pulp. It's a murder either way and they may as well truly murder her. Despite all the nagging problems, I like two villains facing off against each other. I like Pike and Dinklage. There is a fun tension with them for the most part. More could be done with Wiest. She could take over if she's allowed to. At least, she gets to choke a B out. This movie would work a lot better if the writer thinks harder and works over the script."
tt9893250,6.0,"The first hour of this film is so good that it manages to carry the ridiculous implausibility of its second hour to a satisfactory conclusion. If it had not tried to become ""Mission: Impossible"" and stayed confined to the small-time grift of elderly care abuse, this would have been one of the best films of the year. However, like the characters in the film, the writer / director gets greedy, and pays for it."
tt0080491,6.0,"Maybe it helps to be familiar with the history, Art, and literature of the Ancient Rome because ""Caligula"" is surprisingly truthful adaptation of the chapter about Caligula in ""The Lives Of The Twelve Caesars by C. Suetonius Tranquillus, the Roman Historian. If you read the chapter dedicated to Nero, you'll be even more shocked because Nero was always fascinated by his uncle Caligula (he was a son of Caligula's sister Agrippina who later became a wife of Claudius who adopted Nero and made him the heir for the title and the power of Roman Emperor). Anyway, Nero made Caligula his role model and managed to surpass his uncle's' notorious fame.The movie is notoriously famous for the plentiful scenes of real sex, including incest, necrophilia, rape, and orgies. The movie also includes quite nasty and gruesome scenes of torture, executions, murders, and humiliations but all of the events have been documented in the historical documents that still exist.I don't think of the movie as a masterpiece or even a good movie for all of its 2.5 hours. It actually reminds the life of real Caligula. In his childhood and youth, he was adored by Roman people and especially by the army and he was a promising young man. When he grew up as a heir to the cruel and suspicious Tiberius, he had to hide his feelings and go through many humiliations in order to survive. Shrewd Tiberius said about his adopted grandson that ""never humankind knew the better slave and the worse ruler than Caligula"" and that he was rearing ""a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world."" When the young man finally received an access to the absolute power it had absolutely corrupted him. It is also known that soon after becoming head of Roman Empire, Caligula suffered an illness and as the result of it, he became incredibly nasty, cruel, and suspicious man who had indulged in the worst acts of debauchery, cruelty, and sadism. The movie follows this pattern. I still think that it is an interesting movie with very good actors. Not every day you can see porn with Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud, and of course, Mr. Clockwork Orange himself, Malcolm McDowell."

In fact, by now the movie franchise ought to be renamed into ""The Outrageous and Ludicrous"".Still, I had the opportunity to watch ""F9"", and so I did, as I hadn't already seen it.

Yeah, I will say that much, because the visuals definitely are top notch and help carry the movie, as basically everything else in the movie wasn't doing much for the movie.And yeah, they had a very impressive cast ensemble for ""F9"", I will admit that much. What does amaze me, however, is that people on the cast list don't stop up and go ""really?"" when they read the script. But I guess, a dollar is a dollar, huh?If you sit down to watch ""F9"", you have to put aside anything called laws of physics and realism. Because all those concepts are non-existing in this movie. And the abundance of things that was downright laughable and outrageous in ""F9"" is countless, but at least they provided me with a heap of laughs. Yeah, I couldn't help laugh throughout the majority of this movie, because it was just so bad.""F9"" is a watchable movie, but it is essentially just another testimony to why the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise should have stopped after ""Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift"".I am rating ""F9"" a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars. This is a movie that left no impressions on me, and it is one that will just quietly fade into oblivion, given its ludicrous over-the-top lack of respect for laws of physics, gravity and realism."

Every other human being is dying and we're supposed to follow a selfish woman who tried to destroy earth and her daughter who saved the earth. Wow what a plot! And and we're also supposed to feel sad for the sacrifice of evil woman why? cause she sacrificed herself.

tt3741700,5.0,"This is the second Godzilla film in the MonsterVerse series, a story about the crypto-zoological agency Monarch finding themselves facing titan monsters Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah, and their ultimate solution is letting Godzilla battle them all to save mankind.The film is a little reminiscing to Toho Studio's classic 1964 movie, Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, but this time featuring the monsters in the 21st century, with some neat special effects. You get to see each of the monsters' unyielding powers and characteristics, and them battling each other is nothing short of edge-of-your-seat monster excitement. However, the CGI on the creatures were too dark at times, making the monster battles hard to see. It is also difficult to see the creatures' faces and reactions - just a whole lot of head-spinning movements and swift actions.The human drama was average at best, and the good guys vs. bad guys subplot was a major distraction from the film, I thought. Much of the evil doers' actions were overkill, and our protagonists were too preachy, save for Ziyi Zhang's duo doctor roles, which is a great nod to Mothra's tiny twin priestesses in the classic films. I also liked that the filmmakers incorporated Mothra's Song in this movie.But, as with much of today's films, there is forced comedy to lighten up the mood, courtesy of Bradley Whitford's St. Stanton character. His humor was extremely annoying and distracting, very out-of-place for the movie.With all the hard-to-see monster action to the distracting human drama, there is too much in the film to digest and makes it hard to appreciate the main point, which are clearly the monsters. It leaves little room to sympathize with the human characters and leaves you craving for more of the monsters.Grade D+"
tt3741700,6.0,"Crazy review title right? Well you might agree after watching this movie.You'll probably hear a lot of opinions from people who aren't homegrown Godzilla fans - and they will have their own thoughts on this.
I, on the other hand, am a big fan of the monster going years back. Finding a Godzilla movie in the TV guide, or a DVD for one of the Toho movies to rent was like winning the lottery when my brother and I were young.Here are my thoughts plainly stated: Yes, this is a better Godzilla film than the 2014 movie. There are *aspects* of the latter that some might say make it superior, but that would only make it a better movie in general - as a *Godzilla movie* this new one is quite a bit better.Don't listen to the people on RottenTomatoes talking about how ""the special effects are overly relied on and can't make up for the bad characters and plot.""
No. Those CG monsters are the best part, and they almost singlehandedly save this movie. The solution is not to focus less on special effects and develop the characters better. The solution is to have every human character stepped on in the second act and have the last 45 min center the story solely on the monsters - which I guess would mostly be fighting.The problem is this does not happen. Every moment you see the monsters battle, you enter a brief moment of bliss before you are ripped away to deal with people you don't care about doing things you hope they fail at. The first ""clash"" occurs in Antarctica, and that scene was actually quite good despite the focus on the humans. You're just now being exposed to these titans duking it out, so having people there witnessing the madness and trying to escape help play into how incredible this event truly is.By the 3rd act, however, this tolerance has dried up. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't a movie titled ""Godzilla"" imply that he is the main character? Because he doesn't feel like one. Without a doubt, THE biggest problem that Godzilla (2014) and this film have is they place waaayyyy too much value on human beings. Everyone in the audience is waiting for them to shut up and go away, but the movie has its head up its ass and thinks what they're doing is somehow important and worth focusing on. It would be like two warriors facing off, and having most of the climax focusing on ants running around on the ground trying to save each other.The only ""characters"" here that need development are the Kaijus. Have them be your stars. Have them be the focus. It doesn't just have to be mindless action like how snobby people will pretend that's all we want to see. Go ahead and tell a story, but NOT with people. They are not the reason we're watching this, and we don't care about them.One exception to what I said in the previous paragraph: Ken Watanabe
His big character moment was incredible. If you must have human beings involved, do them like this. He was amazing."
tt3741700,5.0,"Ever since the perfection of CGI, Hollywood has come to the conclusion that if the special effects are good, then then movie is good. Thus, my 5 star rating. Half of the movie involved the monster battles and that gets 10 stars. The half of the movie where there is no monster presence gets 0. That averages out to a 5. Perhaps some day Hollywood will re-discover the lost art of screen writing and combine it with CGI to create a truly fantastic movie. But don't look for it to change soon. A lot of people came out of the theater visually dazzled by the special effects knowing that the story was awful but still thought it was a great movie. So they will continue make a lot of money creating these kind of movies and save on time & expense by not having to pay top dollar for a writer."

Mark Russell rejoins Monarch to rescue his daughter. However as various monsters are unleashed, he realises that only Godzilla can save the day.The story is bland, the characters are flat.

They're basically riffing Superman to the Nth degree here. But on to the important stuff...What the heck is Natalie Portman doing in this movie. I mean that in two ways. First why is she even in the movie? Second, what did she do other than stand there and let her hair be blown around by the off screen wind machines? It felt like all of her scenes were filmed in one day and she looks so bored in all of them. Chris Hemsworth was fine as Thor and Hopkins played a good Odin, but it was the human characters that kill this one.At least Branagh threw in Skarsgard for the Swede inside joke. But as usual Stellan Skarsgard is totally wasted. After Insomnia I was just in awe of what the man is truly capable of and here in the states they always use him as a window curtain.I didn't mind the first act all that much, but for a movie about the GOD OF THUNDER, it comes off surprisingly meek."

Here we have Thor the god of lightning and his mighty hammer, directed by a man who works mostly around William Shakespeare plays.Thankfully, this helps. A lot.Almost every superhero movie (Marvel, lately) focuses on more action instead of character development. Sure, they may look awesome, but you get used to it. Branagh bravely steers away from this predicament and directs the actors with such skill and flair you may mistake this film for yet another Branagh/Shakespeare costume epic.Make no mistake this is still a superhero film, with some nice special effects and a stylish production design for Asgard, but there's a nice human twist to the story - that of dueling brothers, or gods, or god- brothers... you get the idea. Chris Hemsworth looks just about right for the part and shows some charisma as well as the hero. Branagh has assembled an interesting mix of actors - we have the great Anthony Hopkins, the cute Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Idris Elba and even Rene Russo. Tom Hiddleston however steals the scene as the mischievous brother Loki.Here's another good thing about the movie - the story and acting outweigh the special effects and action sequences. For a superhero film, this is extremely rare. Branagh deserves kudos for the effort, however some parts do not gel in nicely and there's some action bits that are not too well-filmed.All is forgiven though - ""Thor"" is an above-average superhero movie, not extremely exciting, but definitely intriguing. Fans of both comic book films and costume dramas will certainly enjoy this.Two words of caution - one, keep an eye out for some cameos, both during and after the film. Two, for goodness sake do not watch it in 3D. I saw it in normal 2D and that's fine enough by me. I didn't see anything worth watching in 3D in it.Overall rating: 68/100"
tt0800369,6.0,"Chris Hemsworth is very hot. I never noticed him in a movie before, but there is one too short scene of him shirtless, that is not to be missed. Other than that, I thought this movie was OK with the beginning being the best part and I didn't care for the ending. The first 45 minutes was very entertaining with some good special effects. Basically the first part is about Thor's people and their conflict with the frost giants. The frost giants invade and Thor with his other brother, Loki, and friends go to the frost giant land looking to start a war. We see some of the cool powers Thor has with his hammer. But the King is furious and banishes Thor to earth minus his powers and that's when the movie starts to get duller. He meets scientist, Natalie Portman, whom of course he falls for. I thought there should have been funnier scenes between Thor and regular people. He gets in trouble with the Feds, but just gets released, then the ending is this giant robot that is some how controlled by Loki from the other planet. Then the final battle between Thor and Loki, I just thought the latter scenes were not as entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the comic book movies, then I'm sure you will want to see this."
tt12261776,5.0,"I'm the exact target audience for this movie. I'm a sci-fi junkie, I love thrillers, Adam Driver is awesome, and I'll watch basically anything with large scary creatures. This should have been a layup for me to like. Yet I found myself unengaged and somewhat bored. I started feeling sleepy even after a Red Bull.I don't really know how or why it happened, but this is just a forgettable movie. Some dumb things happen but I am able to turn my brain off. Although after watching the Angry Joes review, I didn't realize how many dumb things I ignored. I guess I just didn't care enough to notice them.I hope a movie like this doesn't discourage studios from going for more of these mid-budget movies. I like the idea of an isolated story somewhere random in space/time. I just hope they do a better job next time. (1 viewing, opening Sunday 3/12/2023)"
tt12261776,6.0,"I really think this film would be doing much better at the box office with a better title and clearer marketing. This is a more than serviceable action thriller starring a legitimate star that is mostly entertaining for its 90 minute runtime.The CGI is surprisingly good given the small budget and it's cool seeing dinos in a non-Jurassic Park film. The story is probably the weakest element given its cliched beats and real Last of Us vibe. Some wooden dialogue and lack of exposition round out my critiques. I liked the futuristic tech in the film and Driver delivers an expected solid showing. 65 won't light the genre on fire, but it's better than it's getting credit for."
tt12261776,6.0,"Easily had more potential than what was served up. I was really looking forward to this when I seen the trailer but this had next to 0 marketing..one thing that did attract me was Sam Raimi was producing so instantly it got my attention. The CGI is so mixed one minute at the beginning it's like watching the BBC walking with Dinosaurs program that was released around 20 years ago but the CGI middle to end is good? It's like they kept the budget for the big finale but there isn't a lot of Dinosaurs in this, so if you're going with tye expectations of seeing a lot of Dinosaurs you won't get it. There's a period in the middle of the film were it just sort of trudges on with not much happening. I personally would watch it again but I won't be in a rush to and I'm highly disappointed they didn't do better in every department..story action and CGI."
tt12261776,6.0,"The Good:Awesome recreation of a wild dangerous world full of dinosaurs and threads of death and struggle for survival. The suspense and fear is better than Jurassic Park.Really cool Sci-fi tech featured, really awesome play on someone (Driver) struggling to survive a primitive world while also having highly advanced technology, but still facing challenges
Top-notch cinematography, lighting, and CGI makes you feel very immersed into the world and situationsThe Bad:The plot is extremely basic and predictable. Man faces a few obstacles that he overcomes, most of them the same situation, that's about it. There's only two characters basically, and the dialog between them is limited. This works for a bit, but there's not enough development of the characters, and it's easy to just not care about what happens to them one way or another.It could have been much better if there was more objectives in the plot, more characters or build up, more on what happened before and after the situation on the planet."
tt12261776,5.0,"I honestly didn't come into this one with very big expectations. Unfortunately, it didn't even reach that low bar.The premise seemed OK, although the marketing implied that this was a human (they even refer to him as an astronaut) meaning there would be a time-travel element, but no, he's just an alien from 65 million years ago, albeit one who is as absolutely human as lazy writing would make him.Adam Driver plays Mills (this is an alien name?) who is the pilot taking an exploration team to... aw, who rally cares? They're all in suspended animation for the two-year journey, although they must have been taking the scenic route, since a rescue ship is able to reach the planet in just a few days.Only Mills and an eight-year-old girl (why does an exploration team have an 8-year-old along?) manage to survive the crash on prehistoric Earth after the ship is hit by an asteroid (note to writer: they're not ""meteors"" until the hit the atmosphere) and spend the rest of the film walking through a not-very-Cretaceous looking forest dodging dinosaurs. Although this situation should lead to at least a modicum of suspense, every encounter is so telegraphed by the direction that you see it coming a mile away.Of course, 65 million years ago is a very rounded-off time frame, but gee whiz, wouldn't you know it? An extinction-level asteroid JUST happens to be only hours away from hitting the Yucatan and wiping out the dinosaurs, and any aliens who have crashed there in the past day or two. (Great timing! Why couldn't we have crashed last week?)I'll give credit to the CGI genies, who did a reasonably good job with the diosaurs and the meteor effects, though both were a bit underutilized and often done in dark areas (or even off camera with only holographic puppets filling in) so they wouldn't HAVE to be perfect. In the same vein, congrats also to whoever decided that the alien little girl wouldn't be able to speak English like the alien Mills: as with the dark CGI, a kid can't deliver her lines poorly if she doesn't really have any.This one really should have gone straight to DVD (not even bluray.) I wondered why it wasn't being shown in the IMAX at my local theater. Now I know. If you ever want to see this on a screen bigger than your TV, I'd suggest you hurry."
tt12261776,5.0,"Frankly with all the hype I thought I would at least like it...it did not happen...The visuals leading to the story were amateurish to say the least, like something out of the 70's or 80's, and went downhill from there. CGI dinosaurs have been done and overdone for years now, so I figured this outing might have some good ones...unfortunately no one opened a single book to find out what dinos are supposed to look like, and act like too...the T-Rex was passable but that was the only one that came close to impressing me.I had been hoping for a while that 65 would follow an old ancient aliens theory that us Earthlings were actually descendants of a past civilization, but noooo...the writers went with we were just visited, crashed or whatever, and the protagonist manages to escape back to his own home planet...in other words this movie was a waste of money for me..."
tt12261776,5.0,"'65' is a dinosaur film with a twist. It's just a shame the twist doesn't really add much to the overall film. Mills (Driver) is essentially the only actor, with his daughter Nevine (Coleman) and wife (King) appearing at the start - and Nevine in a few holograms/flashbacks - but then the only other actor being Koa (Greenblatt) who becomes almost a surrogate daughter when they're stranded.Not sure if it's a spoiler or not, but Mills is piloting a spaceship from some other galaxy and crash-lands on Earth - it just so happens to be 65 million years ago and just as the asteroid is approaching Earth. This sets up a situation with one man + futuristic tech vs dinosaurs. You just have to go with it. Instead of making it more a 'Prey' or 'Predator' situation, the film instead focuses on what's happened to Mills' daughter and Koa and trying to establish a human connection, when we really don't care. Was a bit disappointed there were only 3 dinosaur sightings/interactions in the first 45min.Some good cinematography, filmed mostly in the forests of Oregon & swamps of Louisiana. There's some tension occasionally built, but for a short 90min film, there's far too much time with nothing really happening. Driver's fine, but I'm not sure having a young child speaking a foreign language as his only co-star helped him. The ending is a bit ridiculous, but at least we see a few more dinos in the 2nd half, but not enough to make this rewatchable."
tt8337264,6.0,"Aardman Animations, personally, is a hit or miss for me as in the past, they have created some great works like Wallace & Gromit, Shaun the Sheep and so forth. But at the same time, they have made some pretty mediocre or pretty bad works too. ""Chicken Run"" is one of my favorite stop-motion movies as I really like the characters, the animation, and the narrative. With this sequel coming out after many years, it was entertaining but it was a bit underwhelming.Throughout, the stop-motion animation, character models, and colors are amazing as Aardman continues to provide great clay animation. Aardman always provides some great animation and the models, colors, sound designs, and the movements are all excellent. We get to see the same characters from the previous movie and it was fun to see them communicate, move around and observe their actions throughout. The voice performances from the cast members were solid as they provided some good voice works, although a few voice performances weren't great. The soundtrack is pretty good and there are some decent humor moments that I chuckled at.With the narrative continuing from the previous movie, the narrative explores some new concepts and territories within the setting and characters and there are some aspects that were interesting but some not so much. Certain new concepts that were explored I felt weren't strong enough and at times, it really feels like a rehash of the first movie. On the characters, there are new characters that are introduced but unfortunately, none of the new characters weren't really interesting since they felt a bit dull and kind of annoying at times. Because this is a new cast, I personally felt while the original characters are still fun, the chemistry and energy of what made them fun from the first movie felt a bit lacking. The soundtrack is okay and there are some solid dialogue moments while being a bit clunky.Despite my gripes, I still was interested to see where the movie goes and for what it is, it's a decent sequel. Overall, it is entertaining and it's nice to see the characters again, but I wish it could have been better."
tt8337264,5.0,"Looks like the creators didn't learn anything from the failure of Early Man (2018). A successful family animation needs to engage folks of any and all ages - the first Chicken Run did to a good extent. This one didn't. Ditto Early Man.Audiences want to see relatable settings, characters with soul, plots that are realistically challenging (not pointlessly ridiculous). So we end up with a colourful bland bright happy island commune ... overdone, unrelatable and boring. Then we get a silly super high tech robots and gadgets filled chicken farm/factory - huh? And football matches in prehistoric Early Man? Huh?From the short documentary on 'the making of' its immediately clear the creators and team spent a massive 99% effort on the puppeting, the sets, the lighting, the movements, the look of things - which is fine, except, where's the effort on the story, the characters, the soul of the whole thing??The director even laughed at how fun it was to give Ms Tweedy a glam look - but hello mister - did you ask yourself what the viewers want out of a once iconic scary evil character like her? A glam up look? Really?It does seem all the people involved in this - many very competent in their area of specialty - was more focused on putting out their best on producing their area of specialty than making an animated movie that truly relates to the audience.For instance so much technical deal and effort was made of Tweedy walking down glass steps - if the story and plotting was better it wouldn't have mattered if she was walking down milk carton cutouts with average lighting and a less smooth gait.Do please spend more thought and effort on plotting and characters and audience impact, and less on the visual razzle dazzle."
tt8337264,6.0,"There are some prequels or sequels that no one asked for, but end up being happy that they happened anyway.This sadly isn't one one of them.I was already upset by the fact that many of the core voice actors were being replaced. Mel Gibson I could understand for obvious reasons, but the excuse for Julie Sawalha's exclusion was not acceptable. I do believe the real reason was because Sawalha is no longer famous, while Thandi (or Thandiwe) Newton, her replacement, is a big name in the industry. This is a growing trend in modern animation where famous actors are favoured to voice cartoon characters rather than actual voice actors.At one point Ginger fearfully says ""that voice!"" before the reveal of the return of Mrs Tweedy. It would have been extremely awkward if Miranda Richardson was no longer voicing the villain.The story itself is a little too similar to the first Chicken Run and the animation looks too shiny and CGIed, despite most of it being clay-animation. The stakes were not really as high, and the characters were not as fleshed out as they were in the first film.My favourite character is still Fowler, as he was still hilarious. And unlike the new voices for the other main characters, David Bradley does a great job here.The humour in the first film was intelligent and witty. But despite most of the film still being proudly British (even including a chicken character with a Scouse accent)
, the magic and the passion found in the first film has dampened down quite a lot here.Kids will no doubt enjoy it. But after 23 years, I wasn't all that impressed."
tt8337264,6.0,"For me, this sequel was a decent continuation of the original. It was based on the same concept as the original with some minor additions.The story was simple and light hearted just like the original, the screenplay was decent, the direction was decent, the animation was unique like the original and the voice actors did a good job. The thrill elements were embedded nicely in the story which makes this normal story little bit enjoyable.But to be honest, I think this sequel was unnecessary as it was underwhelming if we compare it to the original. Overall, this movie was a decent entertainer."
tt8337264,5.0,"'Chicken Run: Dawn Of The Nugget (2023)' is the long-awaited belated sequel to 'Chicken Run (2000)', Aardman's earliest feature-length film. The picture isn't a patch on its predecessor, but before I can give my thoughts on it, I first need to address the elephant in the room. Mr. Elephant, please leave so I can get this review done. Okay, now that he's out of here, I'll touch on perhaps the only controversial aspect about the picture. The filmmakers (or at least their new Netflix overlords) made the baffling (and, frankly, mean) decision to recast the protagonist, Ginger, simply because original voice actor Julia Sawalha apparently sounds ""too old"" now. The even more baffling thing is that they not only opted to keep the rest of the cast largely in tact even though most of them sound considerably older than they did in the first flick (which is, I want to be clear, absolutely fine), but also to cast someone a mere four years younger. Now, I love Thandiwe Newton as much as the next guy, but the reason for her inclusion is simply unacceptable (which isn't her fault, of course). Furthermore, it's constantly distracting that the main character no longer sounds anything like she did before when most of the people around her sound, well, almost exactly like they did before. It's not as if Newton delivers a bad performance and I don't think it would have been a good idea for her to try to mimic the tonality of the original voice work, but her vocals don't scratch that same itch and actually go some way (along with the writing) in making the protagonist's characterisation tangibly feel somewhat different. What makes all of this worse is the fact that they seemingly didn't even contact Sawalha to let her know they wouldn't be offering her the role and she had to find out the same way everyone else did. Plus, it appears as though she would have been up for returning if they did ask her to. It's just a really poor decision on the part of the filmmakers and it does leave a sour taste in your mouth, which is bad for everyone involved (Newton definitely doesn't deserved to get bogged down in all this drama). There are some other parts that have been recast but these are mostly welcome. It's a shame that Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels didn't return as Nick and Fletcher, but Romesh Ranganathan is almost a dead ringer for Spall and it's always good to see - or hear - Daniel Mays. David Bradley is brought in to replace Benjamin Whitrow who passed away in 2017, and he confidently maintains the spirit of the role while putting in an entertaining effort of his own. Mel Gibson is given the boot (good) in favour of Zachary Levi (bad), but I don't think anyone blames them for not putting that guy in a children's movie.The film itself isn't bad. In fact, it's perfectly fine. However, perfectly fine isn't good enough when it comes to Aardman, who are typically effortlessly charming even on their bad days. The movie feels very sanitised and safe when compared to the first, which has an underlying grit to it primarily because of its POW camp setting (in terms of both narrative and aesthetic). This is much more colourful and bouncy and traditionally 'kiddy', despite featuring the same underlying stakes (chicken being killed for human consumption). It often feels like a bit of a sci-fi flick, in a way, with designs reminiscent of the more ridiculous 007 movies (or, perhaps more accurately, parodies of them). It's all fine in theory, but it undeniably makes for a less compelling vibe. It sands the edges off the concept and style, so much so that the piece kind of loses its identity and blends with the current slate of generic animated efforts (which is all the more disappointing when you consider how iconic the original still is). Having said all that, the animation on display here is arguably Aardman's most ambitious. They pull off everything they set out to achieve in this respect, too; the thing looks so good you could swear it was created in a computer. There's something so special about the tactility that comes with claymation, and the literal hand-crafted nature of the flick does shine through most of the time (despite things feeling somewhat artificial on occasion). The best sequences are easily the set-pieces, which - while never as memorable as the first flick's masterful pie-machine segment - are often free-flowing, energetic and enjoyable. There are also a handful of rock-solid sight gags and puns, jokes which remind you just how uniquely funny this studio can be. The things in-between the best bits aren't particularly bad, but they aren't particularly good, either. The story itself is very simple, playing with expected themes surrounding the new family situation of its lead, and it follows the classic sequel formula of taking the most memorable characters and sending them on a road trip of sorts while also introducing a couple of newbies who will hopefully become as well-liked as the series stalwarts. It also makes the classic mistake of reducing its side players to their most basic versions, playing up elements which seemed to have connect with the fans without really taking the time to understand why they worked so well in the first place. For instance, Babs has been reduced to being dim-witted rather than naive and her misunderstandings are overplayed to the point of they kind of start to cheapen her character. Elements such as this start to stack up, giving the overall experience a bit of a second-rate feel.Ultimately, this is an unnecessary and mostly unexciting sequel that has its moments but isn't something I can see myself returning to in the future. In all honesty, it's probably my least favourite effort from Aardman. That doesn't mean there isn't some value here, and it's worth a watch if you're a fan of the original. You may find something more to like, or you may be disappointed. It's passively entertaining, but utterly forgettable. While there are certainly worse films out there (a lot of those are Netflix originals, too), this is just an unremarkable effort that doesn't live up to the standard set by its predecessor. It's uneggsceptional."
tt8337264,5.0,"The stop motion is always on point. Impressive, when you think about how much time goes into it.If you work really hard, you can probably scrape together some respect for the production, but that might be the only feeling you can evoke. The voice acting isn't great, and not just because the original actors are missing. There's a strange disconnect between the animation and the acting, it feels insincere and forced.The story is nothing new, and it should have been. It should have broke new ground just as the original did. It really feels like they put no effort into creating an original plot and just clung to the coat tales of the first film. Seems like a bad choice.I want to write something positive about it but I don't really know what that could be. I guess Bella Ramsey was good casting. I'm only giving it 5 stars because I appreciate the time it takes to make stop motion."
tt8337264,6.0,"This sequel to 'Chicken Run' arrives after 23 years, but don't worry, being animated the returning cast haven't aged a bit! Although the story picks up where the original left off, this is an entirely new adventure and you don't really have to see the first film to follow the story, although it is highly recommended. The opening to 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget' recaps the events of the first film in a nutshell.The chickens are living happily on an island away from humans, and Ginger and Rocky starts a family. Their daughter is Molly. No sooner has she become a teenager than she becomes curious about the world and what lies on the other side of the lake. When trucks arrive and start clearing the forest, the chickens devise a plan to shelter themselves from human vision, but Molly wants to explore...and so she does.She befriends a chicken named Frizzle, and together the head to Fun-Land Farms where they believe chickens to live happy lives, according to an advert they saw. Off course the farms are not what it seems, and they soon get into trouble.It's up to Ginger, Rocky and some of their friends to save them. Last time they broke out of a chicken farm; this time they're breaking in. A familiar antagonist from the first film returns, as well, but I won't spoil it for you.I enjoyed the stop-motion animation, the characters, their adventures, and the humour. This is a delightful film young and old can enjoy. The film also illustrates how the younger generation are not always appreciative of what their parents went through to ensure their survival, and I don't think youngsters watching this will fully understand. These are lessons a mature audience will relate to.As much as I enjoyed 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget', I enjoyed 'Chicken Run' more, because it was simpler and funnier."
tt9288692,5.0,"The premise is great, I love the tone, it's pretty funny, and I was generally amused. Everything in the setup intrigued me. But as an overall movie, I feel like it just missed the mark of being something memorable and rewatchable. And while the mystery aspect was well-done, they completely give it away at one point. I'm glad I watched it, but it missed the cut. (1 viewing, 2/3/2022)"
tt9288692,6.0,"When I sat down to watch ""Werewolves Within"", I must admit that I hadn't even heard about the movie, nor seen a trailer or anything, so I wasn't really sure what I was in for here. Yeah, of course the title does sell the concept of this being a werewolf movie, but aside from that, then I only knew this was a horror comedy.So with that clean slate, I sat down to watch the movie, so writer Mishna Wolff - and boy what a coincidence with that surname and the concept of movie, huh? - had every opportunity to win me over.And I will admit that the movie was actually quite interesting. Sure, the werewolf aspect of the movie was there, but there wasn't a whole lot of actual showcasing the lycanthrope itself in the movie. So if you sit down to watch it for that, which I had hoped it would be, then the movie might be a bit disappointing for you.The storyline was interesting, as it managed to combine a handful of different elements and genres in a rather fulfilling and entertaining manner. Director
Josh Ruben definitely managed to put the script and storyline to life on the screen in a pleasing way.""Werewolves Within"" is actually a who did it murder mystery with a supernatural twist to it. So yeah, this wasn't exactly your average werewolf creature feature.It should be said that the acting in the movie is rather good. Although I was not overly familiar with actor
Sam Richardson, then I will say that he definitely was well-cast for this movie.My rating of ""Werewolves Within"" lands on a six out of ten stars."
tt0413300,6.0,"By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0413300,6.0,"Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been"
tt0413300,6.0,"Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½"
tt0413300,6.0,"I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)"
tt11847410,5.0,"It tells an emotionally devastating story in a very simplistic way and comes across very unnatural and shallow. The script deals with a heavy subject matter, but fails to dig deep. There are a lot of things going on that eventually lead nowhere and the whole tone of the movie is very weak. Highlight of the movie is, without a doubt, main character's performance that is very captivating and believable."
tt29686547,5.0,"I read reviews after watching. First I will say that I will refrain from bashing another countries dramas and or acting style to get my point across. It had potential but it missed the mark in my opinion. With that being said I have only watched K&C dramas so this was a new direction. I was not pleased but I wasn't disappointed but that's probably because I didn't have any expectations when I chose it. It's more of a mixture of a bunch of ideas that had absolutely nothing to make them have a common ground.Poverty meets wealth. Wealth abuses power. Then, poverty after losing all hope, eventually finds peace."
tt1190080,6.0,"It was pretty much inevitable that someone would make a movie based on all the 2012 hoopla. Nor is it surprising when that someone is disaster maven Roland Emmerich. His latest effort adheres closely to the formula established by his earlier films ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow""- in other words we get to watch a typically flawed-but-lovable American family (headed by John Cusack and Amanda Peet), along with a range of supporting characters, attempt to survive the end of the world.That's all there is to the basic plot. The real stars of the film are the truly spectacular special effects. Emmerich really pulls out all the stops and creates some truly awesome set-pieces of destruction. In order to ensure that the main characters have endless perilous situations to escape from, we get to see a bunch of natural and man-made wonders get totaled by Mama Nature. Highlights include Los Angeles falling into the sea, Las Vegas being swallowed by the desert, and the Himalayas being submerged by tidal waves.Improbable? Definitely. Ridiculous? You bet. But none of that matters since ""2012"" is exactly the film it was intended to be- a great big popcorn movie that offers big laughs, big thrills, and a lot of good old fashioned fun."
tt1190080,6.0,"When the geologist Dr. Adrian Helmsley and his team discover that the core of Earth is heating due to solar radiation, he advises the North American President about his findings. The American Govern collects money from the worldwide leaders to build arks to save them with necessary people to rebuild civilization. Meanwhile, the unsuccessful writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) discloses that the world is near to end and tries to save his son and his daughter from the tragic end.In the 70's, there was a ""fashion"" of disaster movies, in general with dramatic stories but the special effects in those years were very simple. ""2012"" is the opposite: state-of-art special effects and an imbecile story, i.e., a silly and corny disaster movie. The physical absurd are usually OK for the action, but stupid attitudes is something that is annoying like, for example, the decision to open the gates with less than five minutes to be reached by the tsunami, or swimming wearing tie. There are some posts in the Message Board listing the implausible or stupid scenes and attitudes. The Church in Brazil is suing Columbia Picture for using the image of the Christ Redeemer without previous authorization in an absolute absurd and nonsense; could the true reason be indeed an indirect reprisal for the scene with the destruction of the Vatican? My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""2012"""
tt1190080,5.0,"They had all the money, actors and special effects they needed so how did they manage to screw this one up? Obviously they thought exiting moments were more important than developing deeper characters and that's why this story that had great potential stayed so shallow. The dialog was always cheesy and none of the 'hero's' in this film really showed any real emotions nor did they give any of those speeches that give the audience goose bumps. Another thing that really bothered me was that so much was almost going wrong the whole time. Every second of the film had a 'close call' which made the film seem totally unrealistic. Examples are planes taking off just before the runway collapses or driving just fast enough to not get hit by an explosion. This can be very cool if it doesn't happen 100% of the time and I have never seen a movie abusing this way of creating excitement to this extent. So to sum up: If you feel like turning your brain off and watching special effects and big explosions with a very shallow storyline then this movie is for you. But if you feel like watching a movie with a bit of depth then go and see something else."
tt1190080,5.0,"I went to an advance screening of 2012 a few nights ago and I have to admit that this movie was entertaining at best and that's it. The whole movie is almost entirely comprised of special effects. Of course you'll see all of the lead characters survive scenarios that a regular human being would not. Some of the scenes are so ridiculously unbelievable that you want to laugh at the fodder that's being expected of you to believe. Emmerich certainly pushes ""suspension of disbelief"" to its limit.John Cusack and Woody Harrelson are the only actors that attempt to hold the film together, while Danny Glover and Thandie Newton were an utter and complete let-down considering their previous work history. You won't see any remotely Oscar-worthy performances here. The casting of this film seemed off and poorly executed. You could tell the bulk of the financial budget went to the special effects and not the actors.The thing that I found thoroughly disappointing about 2012 is that it's almost entirely lacking of any interesting backstory or intellectual substance whatsoever. There's very little mention of the Mayan calendar, Mayan history, or any of the prophetic wisdom that has foreseen the supposed end of days. The fear, analysis, curiosity, and everything else you've ever wondered about this new mysterious year that is quickly approaching is almost entirely removed from this film. That would have and could have made this film closer to a 10 if I didn't feel like my brain was utterly wasted on this CGI and special effects bonanza. They try to cram so many explosions, eruptions, earthquakes, and natural disasters into two hours that I might be a little desensitized to the real thing if it ever happens. After awhile nothing felt realistic or interesting about it at all.It's novelty entertainment at best and that's it. You won't wince at how painfully awful this movie is, and you won't walk away knowing anything meaningful about 2012, but hopefully you'll help repay Sony pictures for the exorbitant amount of money that they and Roland Emmerich spent on their special effects budget. Don't say you weren't warned."
tt10954652,6.0,"Good story, intriguing enough to keep your interest, kind of freaky and unintentionally funny in places. The actors were a bit random, it's a strange kind of film but it was ok. What's annoying is the lack of explanation to the cause so it loses points for that."
tt10954652,5.0,"I'll give it to Shyamalan for his innovative one-line ideas, some of which translate well onto the screen. Old boasts an original concept and sumptuous cinematography (by Mike Gioulakis), but the writing and performances fail to see it through. Once the ageing aspect is set in motion, the film loosens its grip on the viewers, eventually settling for a tame finale. The characters fail to connect due to their weak portrayals and artificial-sounding dialogue.The beachy location is indeed a treat for sore eyes. I cannot get enough of listening to waves in the background, and this film proved to be an unexpected respite in that regard. Getting old fast is a scary notion when you actually give it some thought. But in the movie, it is told in such a way that the science-fiction aspects come second to convenient plot holes. The climactic twist also doesn't land well. Old is ultimately a forgettable fare.P. S - Can we stop killing Eliza Scanlen in every movie? Like, seriously."
tt10954652,6.0,"For those of you who claim to blink one day and your whole life is behind you, this movie may give you major anxiety. The story is of a mysterious island where certain visitors are chosen and carted off to a special place where you age quickly. By quickly the math turns out to be 3 hours would equal 10 years. Having discovered this phenomenon too late the ""castaways"" soon become desperate in trying to find the escape path. If there is one.It's a tragic story of (sometimes) undeserving victims. As if the mysterious resort is giving human sacrifices to appease the God of Youth. Instead it's something a little more than that. If you've seen ""The Village"" you get an inkling of it. In the short amount of time surrounding these poor souls...much is discussed. Regret, love, forgiveness. In that message of ""say the important things to the ones you love before it's too late"" this seems to hang over its head. The rest is just typical Shymalan. Depending on where you sit with him. It may grate on you.I will say this.... I stumbled upon watching this in a room full of, what looked to be, teenage girls. They were silent the entire time. My guess: trying to unfold the mystery. To that, I would say it's a win."
tt10954652,6.0,"Guy (Gael García Bernal) and his family have been given an exotic resort vacation. They and other guests are brought to a secluded closed beach. Soon, they realize that the kids are growing older by years and nobody can escape.Like a lot of M. Night Shyamalan movies, he has a fascinating idea and a twist. The idea is really good. The twist explains some of the idea but in reality, it's not actually necessary. It would be more compelling to have the group stumble upon a mini Bermuda triangle from which no one can escape. As for the group, I do have an issue with them not doing everything to try to escape. They often feel stuck by their own inaction. The only one truly figuring out stuff seems to be Jarin. What got me is when Kara tries to climb out. Instead of helping, almost everyone is trying to stop her and stop Trent from joining her. First of all, one of the adults should have tried climbing before then. I also wonder why they don't try to tie together a rope or MacGyver something. The pool noodles are meant to be funny but I just wondered why that's the first time we're shown them. Then there is the passing out bit. The story yadayada a lot of that away. Nevertheless, I still like the idea. It's a fun Twilight Zone episode. M. Night continues to do the twist at the end and this one is fine. This is interesting."
tt10954652,6.0,"""Old"" is the latest from the gloriously inconsistent writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. Will this be great Shyamalan (à la ""The Sixth Sense"") or dire Shyamalan (à la ""The Last Airbender"")? The answer, in my view, is somewhere in the middle. It's a curate's egg of a movie.Positives:
The premise feels very familiar (desert island beach; time slips; weird things happening.... ""Lost"" anyone?). But as a shell for a big-screen adventure it kept me well-engaged.Shyamalan and his ""Glass"" cinematographer Mike Gioulakis use some novel techniques to portray the ageing effects. The angles used feel quite Hitchcockian at times. Shyamalan supports this with the sound design, which makes this a REALLY good movie to watch in a cinema with good surround sound. Often the camera will be spinning showing nothing but ocean or rocks, with the character's conversation rotating behind you in the cinema. It's really quite effective.Shyamalan knows that no visual effects can improve on the horrors your mind can come up with. Although a '15' certificate, the ""sustained threat, strong violence and injury detail"" referenced by the BBFC pales into insignificance (in terms of what you actually see) compared to the equally rated ""Freaky"".I've seen other reviews comment that the ""twist"" (no spoilers here) was obvious. But, although not a ground-breaking idea, I was sufficiently satisfied with the denouement. It made sense, albeit twisted sense.Negatives:
I enjoyed the movie's leisurely set-up, introducing the characters and the movie's concept. (In many ways, it felt like the start of one of Irwin Allen's disaster movies of the 70's and 80's). But then Shyamalan turns the dial up to 11 and the action becomes increasingly farcical. Add into that the fact that you can see some of the 'jolts' coming a mile off, and the movie becomes progressively more disappointing, with a high ERQ (eye-rolling quotient) by the end.In particular, there are inconsistencies to the story that get you asking uncomfortable questions. For example, wounds can heal in the blink of an eye.... but not stab wounds apparently.The cast is truly global in nature: Vicky (""Phantom Thread"") Krieps hails from Luxembourg; Bernal is Mexican; Sewell is a Brit; Amuka-Bird (""David Copperfield"") is Nigerian; Leung is American; Eliza Scanlan is an Aussie; and Thomasin McKenzie (so good in ""Jojo Rabbit"", and good here too) is a Kiwi. But although it's clearly quite natural that an exotic beach resort would attract guests from all over the world, the combination of accents here makes the whole thing unfortunately sound like a dodgy spaghetti western!Summary Thoughts: 'Time' and 'ageing' have of course been a popular movie topic for many years. I remember being both gripped and horrified by George Pal's wonderful 1960's version of ""The Time Machine"" when Rod Taylor threw his machine into fast forward and the dead Morlock decomposed in front of his eyes! Ursula Andress did the same as the rapidly ageing Ayesha in 1965's ""She"". And, more recently and with better effects, Julian Glover did the same in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".Unfortunately, ""Old"" isn't likely to join any of these classic movies in my consciousness. It's a diverting enough movie, with fabulous views of the Dominican Republic (which the local tourist board will no doubt be delighted with). A ""less is more"" approach might have made this a classic. But unfortunately, that's not what Shyamalan delivered here. Since what we get is a 'Lost-lite' with farcical elements.And, by the way.... The movie that Charles (Rufus Sewell) refers to starring Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando is ""The Missouri Breaks"". It has a very unusual John Williams soundtrack, which I have on vinyl somewhere and is probably worth a few bob!(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb, Facebook and Tiktok.

Because you never know when you might get the chance to visit Fantasy Island (not the one in Skegness) and live your life like Ben Button, but a bit faster and in reverse. Not the worst film from the genre and would have been a cult classic if made as a 'B' Movie in the 1950s."
tt10954652,6.0,"If you knew you were to die today, what would you wish to change about the way you lived your life?This is one of the themes Shyamalan explores in this astutely-directed, mostly tense, high-concept thriller, and it does result in some genuinely intelligent, emotionally resonant character beats that I did not expect.Unfortunately, some clunky dialogue, a couple bad actors, and too many repetitive scenes that seem to only stretch the runtime prevent this from being the great film that it could have been."
tt14833464,6.0,"Players is a new addition to Netflix's roster of rom cons and at this point it might start to get stale, but I thought this was fun. Gina Rodriguez is looking better all the time. She's a bit of a player and has a list of different ways to get men in her bed. She falls for tom Ellis but his a cock so there is no spark. It's a bit of a predictable movie in the sense that we all could tell how it would end. I thought it was a fun watch though and for me atleast it got a couple of little laughs from me. It came out just in time for valentine's so it's nice seeing a pretty woman get it on. Overall players is cheesy and predictable but overall still not bad."
tt14833464,5.0,"I'm not gonna lie, most romantic comedies feel dated (no pun intended). They just do. Take 2024's Players for instance. It appears like it's straight from the bin of the early-to-mid 2000s, when stars Kate Hudson, Drew Barrymore, Adam Sandler, Katherine Heigl, and Matthew McConaughey ruled the roost. It's like the evolution of falling in love well, never evolved. ""You're gonna go after her?"" Not sure on that one honey.That's not to say that Players doesn't have a few entertaining moments cause it does. It's about a female sportswriter (Gina Rodriguez as Mack) who decides with her buds, to form a relationship via a guy she had a one-night stand with (Tom Ellis as Nick). Said buds (and Mack herself) do this NFL-style, with an amorous playbook hoping to rekindle the remnant love. The problem is that all the poop jokes, awkward dialogue exchanges, stealth stalking clips, and galling side characters keep getting in the way. I mean almost everyone in Players is in their 30s and they act like they're conveying junior high deportment. Ugh!X's, O's, and callow besties aside, Players was shot in NYC almost three years ago and is distributed by Netflix (what isn't). And oh yeah, the film has a lead in Rodriquez that is adorable. Players also finds its footing in the last half as the nearly pauper, personas involved just shut up for a second and act human. What Players doesn't have however, is novelty or any kind of break with tradition. I mean when you can predict the ending about 40 minutes into a 105-minute runtime (girl gets guy but not the guy you think she gets), it's time to face ""the ugly truth"", stick to ""what happens in Vegas"", or look at ""27 dresses"" (if you're a girl of course). ""Played out""."
tt14833464,5.0,"5.3/10 (Not Recommended)I thought this movie would be more of a group of people having fun and running a Playbook similar to Barney Stinson in HIMYM. However, it feels like a long drawn out trope for one guy that doesn't even feel exciting. The cast has some good and bad chemistry. At some points they're enjoyable together and at others annoying. The romance is relatively weak. The sub-romance was more intriguing than the main one. The lives, the backgrounds aren't very interesting. The overall length of the film is too long. I lost a lot of interest throughout and was thankful by the time it ended. It drags on and has no redeeming qualities. Hopefully you're not wasting your time watching it on Valentine's Day cause it's not a worthy V-Day movie.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"
tt14833464,5.0,"The movie shows everything that's wrong with modern dating. It depicts a woman having to play games, stalk and lose herself to be with a guy she knows nothing about. She mistakes attraction for love after 5 minutes, which they use as an excuse for the horrible things she does to Nick.(If you don't thinks the stalking, playing with his heart and destroying his current relationships are horrible... It's time to take a look in the mirror)
Her behaviour during the enitre, predictable, movie makes it hard to feel sorry for her. Even when it all comes tumbling down, you just feel ""that's what you get""
To then end up where she should have looked in the first place, the guy that's there for her. The guy that knows her and loves everything about her.But she only realises this when her friends tell her... Which is a cheap plotline. Instead of letting her have a moment of self reflection. No a woman needs to be told when someone truly loves her or she's never going to see it. The movie clearly doesn't feel how wrong the entire plot is.Oh how I miss the cute rom-com storries."

Plus the guy is a award winning writer and the movie wants us to believe that the boring girl jane the virgin plays in the movie wrote an amazing piece even though the award winning didnt liked her writing... yeah, sure.

She decides to run a play on him.I get it. This role is traditional a dude. It's Wedding Crashers or any number of stories where guys scheme to bed the hot dumb girls. Only, the translation cannot be done one for one directly. First, she needs a reason to do what she does. She needs romantic trauma to send her down this road. Second, the romantic entanglement should not have a fourth wheel. A love triangle is so much easier. As its heart, this is a simple rom-com. The rom is a bit of hit and miss. The com is struggling. Gina Rodriguez is a nice charming actress and she makes this barely acceptable."

We've been over this formula of movies since the 90s, the fact that they're predictable makes them really bad. And here's the thing, this movie had all the potential of being good, except when you went into the formula part of it and started to make it the same stupid thing as the 9000 romcoms before it were.Just stop making movies predictable, the first 30 minutes were great, it had originality and flair, and then you started with the whole ""girl finally wants to get the guy"" part and it sucked BADLY.

tt5144174,6.0,"Unfortunately, we make very few films here in Australia, and we rarely make great films, that's why when a fairly ok movie comes out, we all get excited. Our local movie critics are also incapable of judging local films without bias. They too, get overexcited and rave on about a film like ""The Dry"". This is not a boring film, or am awful experience, however, it's really not that great. Of course, we all get sentimental when we see the Australian landscape photographed in a movie, it's close to our hearts and we get touched by it. This film has all the ingredients to potentially have been a great film, but that opportunity was missed. The story has many holes, the constant flashbacks get confusing, the performances are not that great, Eric Bana has no chemistry with anyone on the screen, the soundtrack is nonstop and aimless, and annoying. The dialogue is also poorly done. Very basic screenwriting, nothing sophisticated, very much on-the-nose. I understand the desire to portray the simplicity of the characters being a country/rural setting, however, films like Coen Brothers' ""Fargo"" achieve this without compromising the integrity of the dialogue. This definitely didn't live up to the hype. Watch it of course to support our home-grown. film industry, but we really need to up our game."

A tawdry trite unskilled work. Open spaces very nicely filmed."
tt5144174,6.0,"Eric Bana commands the screen, ably supported by Genevieve O'Reilly but the direction just lacked spark. This was a film that begged to be evocative, yet it just plodded through, getting the job done with no standout atmosphere. Robert Connelly is a journeyman director. Solid but unremarkable. If it were not for Bana, this film would have passed by unnoticed. By comparison Iven Sen creates slow burn, outback, damaged detective films that burst with atmosphere and leave you with red dust up your nose."

The 117 min runtime and dragged out slow pacing felt endless, I was begging for the end, and it wasn't a rewarding one. The directing was all over the place and lacked urgency and continuity. There was just too much filler for the little substance, of which only became apparent towards the end, and you'll say ""that's it?"". Writer and director Robert Connolly needed more ""oomph"" and less ""clunk"" in this film. The performances were decent, although Bana seemed bored for the most part. The cinematography, landscape and score were excellent, and the only real highlights of this film. Had Connolly cut and trimmed many scenes to make this no more than a 90 min film, I may have liked it more. It's a 6/10 from me."
tt1483013,6.0,"I love Tom Cruise in action + science fiction movies. He is one of the few actors who seem to believe those futuristic roles and is usually great in this sort of films. That being the case, I was looking forward to watching this film.From the production and design point of view, this is a fantastic film, spectacular scenery and camera takes, very sleek futuristic design and a great atmosphere. Unlike your usual galactic out space story, this is not dark or cold, but very light, airy, bright and beautiful.The story starts very promisingly, but soon deflates because the script starts to wander unnecessarily and is not organically presented to viewers, who will feel in a constant state of What the Heck? Once the action starts. The plot, albeit intriguing and original, is not well developed for the big screen, and it is not clear enough, does not have a good tempo, it does not build up properly for the ending, and the editing contributes to the narrative confusion, when, in fact, the script is not that complex.Personally, I think Andrea Riseborough is the best of the bunch in this film; she carries most of the intrigue, drama and confusion of the story with her acting. Cruise is good in his role, although not as convincing an brilliant as in the film he would shot the following year, Edge of Tomorrow. Olga Kurylenko is really sweet as Julia, and Morgan Freeman OK as the scavenger Bleech.This is an enjoyable film with amazing visuals and, a priori, intriguing and original script, but the story is poorly told, the dialogues not especially inspired and the acting just all right. It could have been super-duper, but it is not because amazing visuals rarely make an amazing movie by themselves."
tt14483774,6.0,"Saw this at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival""Shortcomings"" is a story about a trio of young Bay Area urbanites--Ben Tanaka, Miko Hayashi, and Alice Kim--as they navigate a range of interpersonal relationships, traversing the country in search of the ideal connection. This is Randall Park's first debut feature and I gotta say it's a pretty good first time directing project. Shortcomings explores about friendship, love, narcissism, and growth revolving around Asians or Asian American communities. I wasn't fully wowed by anything from the movie but I was still able to connect with the movie.Park is able to capture the interesting chemistry between the cast members and the modern setting with some fun humor and personalities explored. The performances from each cast members was really good and Justin H. Min does a pretty good job portraying a man child of a person. The camerawork wasn't too special but it was good for the overall setting. The production is good and some of the dialogue was well-written and funny.However, the story does become pretty predictable as it continues. A generic rom-com story where predictable movements were going to happen. But without Park's charms and chemistry, it would have been like a bad hallmark movie. Despite having some good dialogue, there were some dialogue moments that felt really awkward or forced and I am not sure if that was intentional or not. If it was intentional then I can understand but if not then those dialogue moments were pretty rough. Some of the supporting characters were a little annoying. Even with my gripes, I was still able to be entertained throughout this film.By all means, it's a decent romantic comedy with good pacing and interesting concepts explored. I'd recommend for those who wanna have a drink or two and watch it for fun.Rating: B-"
tt14483774,6.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. In the past twenty years, Randall Park has built an excellent acting career, likely best known as nice guy dad, husband, and restauranteur on the long-running TV series ""Fresh Off the Boat"". He also had prominent roles in the mini-series ""WandaVision"", ""Veep"", and the Ant-Man movies. Now taking his shot as a feature film director, Mr. Park sticks closely to the Asian community, while simultaneously taking a step forward by not emphasizing generational aspects and familiar cultural tropes. He's working from a script that Adrian Tomine adapted from his own graphic novel.The film opens with Miko (Ally Maki, ""Wrecked"") and Ben (Justin H Min, AFTER YANG) watching the end of a film festival movie. It plays as a parody of the hugely successful CRAZY RICH ASIANS (2018) and leads to contrasting reactions and an argument for Miko and Ben. Miko is the curator of the film festival and is thrilled the movie received such positive audience reactions, while Ben, a struggling indie filmmaker, is totally offput by the film's pandering and mass appeal. We quickly realize Ben is a condescending jerk and Miko is fed up.Ben manages a small arthouse movie theater in Berkeley and often has lunch at a local diner with his only other friend, Alice (a terrific Sherry Cola, JOY RIDE), who points out that his smugness doesn't play well with others. Alice is gay and laughs off her tendency to 'play the field'. Miko calls out Ben on his blonde, blue-eyed white girl fetish, and then soon after announces she is taking an internship in New York City, causing us to realize this movie is probably going to deal with Ben's road to redemption (hopefully resulting in a worthwhile human being).With Miko living across the country, Ben seems to be at his most comfortable with Classic Movies and solo chill. He's a film school dropout with no filter and no sense of timing with his comments and critiques. Basically, he's not a likable guy, and we see this in his separate pursuit of two blond, blue-eyed white girls. He hires performance artist Autumn (Tavi Gevinson) to work the ticket booth at the theater, and has no idea how to deal with her emotional swings and artistic leanings. Things are even worse with Sasha (Debby Ryan), who is coming off a breakup with her girlfriend. Despite warnings from Alice to stay clear, Ben's pompous nature is once again exposed, leaving him all alone.Ben's world changes abruptly when Alice informs him she is also moving to New York and invites him to come visit. He sees this as a chance to get back together with Miko, who has quasi-ghosted him since she left. When Ben arrives, he finds Alice living with Meredith (Sonoya Mizuno, EX MACHINA) in a serious relationship, and stumbles on Miko in a situation that causes confusion, and of course, conflict. Leon (Timothy Simons, ""Veep"") is a NYC fashion designer with an Asian fetish plays a key role in this segment.The film is billed as a comedy, and while there are some funny moments, there is actually a sadness throughout ... most of it related to how most everyone is searching for love while trying to avoid loneliness. During this search, we are often our own worst enemy (Ben being the prime example here). The message here is that while we are all flawed, one can only find joy once they sincerely enjoy the happiness of others. Watching Ben's journey is not always a pleasant viewing experience, however his story is well told.In theaters beginning August 4, 2023."

But the movie? A couple of chuckles here and there, but mostly crickets. And what was up with that plot? More like ""What plot?"" If movies had arcs, this one was stuck in the flatlands. Honestly, by the end, I was just sitting there thinking, ""Did we really need this movie in our lives?"" I guess I set my hopes too high. Thought I was in for a comedy feast but left feeling like I just had a light snack. Bit of a letdown, tbh."

Overall, a pretty bland movie that tries way too hard to be meta and 'anti-woke' that it does not do a good job at being realistic as the direction of actors is pretty bad and the writing is bland/predictable, with the ending feeling like a Dhar Mann video.Pretty Bad Direction (Moves the story forward in a decent way, but it just feels like there is a lot of empty space in the interpersonal scenes cause it doesn't feel like the characters have chemistry with each other (They just feel like stock videos); uses the Rom-Com template as a foil as many aspects of the movie steal from the genre's tropes (but makes fun of it in a meta manner)), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Pretty Bad to Decent from Justin H. Min (Has some moments where he is pretty good but somewhere he clearly is reaching a dramatic limit (Does not hold his own as the leading character as he does not have good chemistry with the rest of the cast (which could be attributed to how he was written))), Decent to Pretty Good from Sherry Cola (The best performance of the movie as plays to her characters strengths well (the comic-relief best friend trope) and gives some range within the confines of what her character is supposed to do (though there is some visible limitation)), Pretty Bad from Ally Maki (The performance just feels a bit one-dimension and the scenes with Min do not have any chemistry (which makes their interpersonal scenes very bland)), Pretty Bad to Decent from Tavi Gevinson (This is more of how the character is written but she just does not feel that believable in this role (mainly from poor direction)), Pretty Bad from Debby Ryan (Does not have any chemistry with Min as her performance just feels very bland and stock), Decent to Pretty Good from Sonoya Mizuno (The most experienced member of the cast as she does show some range of emotion (the only issue being that she does not have that many times to show it and does not work well off of the other characters)), Decent from Jacob Batalon (The comedic relief character that does a decent job at eliciting laughs from the audience, but does not feel very fluid as some parts of the performance felt off), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of minor side characters that do not provide anything)), Pretty Bad Story (The main purpose of the story is to mock the Rom-Com genre, but by doing this it does not develop good story elements as it is more focused on the dialogue and jokes rather than developing an interesting story (everything just feels very stock and safe)), Bad Screenplay (The dialogue feels incredibly simplistic; there were some good jokes but it mostly just felt like the movie was trying to be too Meta to the point that some of the conversations are just hard to listen to for how much back-pedaling there is; the symbolism and message is very shallow as the movie is overt in what it is trying to say but does not do a good job at making the meaning believable), Decent Score (Pretty generic for a rom-com), Decent Cinematography, Decent Sound (The scene where they used the concession microphone in the conversation was a very nice touch, but there were some moments where the mixing felt off), Pretty Bad to Decent Editing (Felt incredibly simplistic and choppy (just safe overall so nothing incredibly wrong)), Plot Structure follows a very similar template to that of a Rom-Com (even though the elements are meant to mimic the opposite), Pacing was a bit quicker than I would have liked (maybe adding 10 minutes to help slow the movie down would have been nice), Climax was incredibly cliche and predictable as the movie builds up to being an 'anti-climax'; the ending sequence of the movie is just so safe and bland that it feels like a Dhar Mann ending (especially with the narration and montage sequence), Tone was incredibly bland as the whole movie felt like it was a stock/fake movie that they would use in a real film (which is ironic given there is one of those in this movie)"
tt0120783,6.0,"Lindsay Lohan shines in her debut film: The Parent Trap, a remake, or more accurately, a re-imagining of the 1961 Hayley Mills' film. Lohan stars as the twin girls, who meet each other at summer camp, discover they're sisters living with divorced parents, and scheme to get their parents back together. This time one twin is from London and the other is from wine country in Napa Valley. Lindsay Lohan is full of charm and talent; she is every bit the equal of Hayley Mills in playing the twins. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson, as the parents, are appealing as well; they have great screen chemistry as parents that never really fell out of love. The supporting roles of the domestics are filled well, and there are several in-joke film references to the first film. The problem with the film is that it is as predictable as it is formulaic, offering us nothing we haven't seen before. Elaine Hendrix, as the fiancé, is funny, but a bit over-the-top in Snidely Whiplash fashion at times. Joanna Barnes, who played this role in the 1961 film, returns as that character's mother this time. The film contains almost laughable turns of plot, which would hardly occur in real life, but it is a family-oriented film. Everything has to come out in the wash. It's interesting to note that the thematic elements concerning divorce do not really have the same negative connotations they most assuredly had in 1961. However, this is really an entertaining showcase for young Lindsay Lohan, a terrific find. This was also the directorial debut for writer Nancy Meyers, who is one to watch. **1/2 of 4 stars."
tt0120783,6.0,"The movie concerns two little girls (Lindsay Lohan in a dual role), they are Hallie Parker and Annie James and both of whom are about to find out .

What if you spent your whole life wishing for something you didn't know you already had? ! Now they're up to their freckles in schemes and dreams to switch places, get their parents back together and have the family they've always wished for!It's a remake of the classy film featured by Mauren O'Hara and Brian Keith along with their daughter played Hayley Mills but here is adapted to the modern times . Lindsay Lohan's interpretation is top-notch likeness to Hayley Mills of previous film , she interprets both roles and she performs outstanding . Lohan is actually a star since she played ¨Mean girls¨ , number-one in United States box office . Special mention deserves Elaine Hendrix as father's bride , her acting is excellent as the ominous and avaricious fiancée . Joanna Barnes who played the bride in the first version here plays Hendrix's mother . In the film there are family incidents , comedy , tongue-in cheek , humor and results to be pretty bemusing . The picture obtained quite success as well as the first adaptation . The motion picture will appeal to familiar comedies fans. Rating: 6/10 . Very nice . Well worth watching."
tt0120783,6.0,"Hallie Parker is an eleven-year-old girl who lives in California with her father Nick, a successful winemaker. She knows very little about her mother, from whom Nick was divorced when she was a baby, and is completely unaware that she has an identical twin sister living in England. Annie James is an eleven-year-old girl who lives in London with her mother Elizabeth, a successful fashion designer. She knows very little about her father, from whom Elizabeth was divorced when she was a baby, and is completely unaware that she has an identical twin sister living in America. And then, quite by chance, Hallie and Annie meet when they are sent to the same summer camp. They quickly realise that they are in fact sisters, and decide that it is their mission in life to reunite their parents. To achieve this ambition they hit upon a plan. Hallie will return to London, pretending to be Annie, and Annie will return to California, pretending to be Hallie. The one obstacle to their plans seems to be Nick's fiancée Meredith, attractive and seemingly charming but really scheming and mercenary. There are plenty of plot holes in this film. I cannot see any divorce court, on either side of the Atlantic, sanctioning the bizarre arrangement Nick and Elizabeth evidently made about the future of their children. (The courts are often reluctant to split up siblings, especially twins). The British aristocracy do not normally send their children to American summer camps. (Elizabeth's father, with whom she lives in a huge London mansion, is evidently from the upper classes). Is it really conceivable that neither Nick nor Elizabeth would have told their child that she has a sister? And is it conceivable that neither of them would have seen through the deception that was being practised upon them, especially as Lindsay Lohan's English accent, both as Annie and as Hallie-pretending-to-be-Annie, often slips? (Hallie-pretending-to-be-Annie is eventually exposed by her grandfather, and Annie-pretending-to-be-Hallie by her father's maid). Fortunately, this is the sort of film in which plot holes do not really matter, being a romantic comedy, not a serious, realistic drama. It effectively revives the ""comedy of remarriage"", a sub-genre of romantic comedy which deals with a divorced or separated couple who rediscover their love for one another. This type of film was very popular in the thirties and forties (""The Philadelphia Story"" is perhaps the best-known example) and to a lesser extent in the sixties (the original ""Parent Trap"" was made with Hayley Mills in 1961) but has become less common in recent years. There was perhaps a reason why Disney decided to remake this film and revive the genre. The story differs from most rom-coms in an important respect. Most romantic comedies focus upon the lovers themselves, but in this one Dennis Quaid as Nick and Natasha Richardson as Elizabeth end up playing supporting roles to the triumphal entry of Lindsay Lohan onto the world stage. This was, of course, the film which first launched Li-Lo onto an unsuspecting world, and it is she who steals the show. One film was all it took to establish herself as the most self-assured, charismatic and lovable child star of the age, just as Hayley Mills was in 1961. (Like Hayley, Lindsay plays both sisters). The focus on the film's child star makes it ideal for a family audience, whereas most romantic comedies are intended primarily for adults. I've never actually seen the 1961 version so I can't compare the two, unlike many reviewers who seem to have a definite preference for one version or the other. The 1998 version is no great masterpiece, but it is an amiable and likable family comedy with a great little heroine. 6/10"
tt0120783,6.0,"This was cute. Lindsay Lohan wasn't the best actor in the world, I must admit, but for a child actor, she wasn't terrible. The part when they were at camp was a bit boring, but after you got into the movie, it was pretty good. Good film to watch with your whole family.7/10 *******"
tt0120783,6.0,"It's a remake of the Disney classic. Lindsay Lohan plays identical twins separated after their parents (Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson) divorced. They reunite at summer camp and discover their connection. They devise a plan to switch places to see the other parent, and force them to meet again.The plot is stupid. The premise of splitting twins is draconian. The plan is actually at the level of an 11 year old's mind. It's a farce worthy of early 60s Disney.Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson make for a likable couple. But it's Lindsay Lohan who does some great kid-acting here. She's playing two different characters with two different accents, and she plays them convincingly. It's incredible to see her acting two sides of the same conversation without missing a beat. It's easy to see her potential."
tt1020530,6.0,"EDEN LAKE is another in the recent wake of 'survival horror' movies yet it's nowhere near as good as something like WILDERNESS. That's because the director is so obsessed with conveying a moral message he messes up the film itself, leaving it a suspense-free outing that provides a timely reminder of the horrors of youth culture but doesn't really work as an engaging horror movie. In terms of the morality and the message it conveys I enjoyed it; taboo topics such as knife crime, racism, peer group pressure, gang culture, the murder of innocents, and class divide are scrutinised and it makes for very interesting, if harrowing, viewing. Take the twist ending, for instance, which is horrifying in itself and almost unwatchable, reducing humans to the level of animals.In terms of being a horror film or a thriller, it seems pretty redundant. We've had the 'heroine battling brutes in the woods' theme done to death, and better, in the likes of SEVEREANCE and there's nothing new here. Scenes like the foot impalement are just there for the gross-out pain factor and don't further the plot in any way. There are some stand-out moments – the bit with the Pakistani boy outdoes HOSTEL PART II in terms of sheer outrageousness – and Thomas Turgoose's scene is one of the most harrowing ever. But for the most part this is par for the course, with stupid characters acting unbelievably – 300's Michael Fassbender is stuck with the thankless role of idiotic male lead and wanders around a stranger's house at one moment – and some singularly unpleasant bad guys. There's no entertainment to be found here, just grimness and depravity. I love films where the good guys finally turn the tables on their oppressors – as in HOSTEL, one of my favourites – but here director James Watkins focuses instead on his theme of innocents suffering so there isn't any 'revenge' factor to enjoy.EDEN LAKE is gruelling and unpleasant, but watching it is an oddly detached experience. It just takes place, is over, and you're left wondering why you spent an hour and a half of your life in such depressing company. Depressing is the main description I would use for this one."
tt1020530,6.0,"Trust me, I live here. This movie is the complete opposite of the likes of Love Actually, Four Weddings etc., and it is far more representative of the reality here. It's not a perfect film, and it's a grim, difficult watch, but it's extremely well and convincingly acted, and it had me on the edge of my seat. Worth watching, and to those in other parts of the world who might think it's all Royal weddings and tourist attractions here, this might open your eyes to how it really is."
tt2788710,6.0,"-The Interview, maybe you have heard of it, follows two idiots, played by James Franco and Seth Rogan, who host a talk show, when one day they are invited to interview Kim Jong-un. This prompts the CIA to recruit the two to 'take out' the leader of North Korea.-I was happy to watch The Interview just to support the film industry really, but it turns out that it came with a pretty hilarious film! -The story, mainly the concept, does not wear out like Let's Be Cops, but actually gets better and better.-The pace is pretty good and the film does not waste time. I did feel like one scene dragged, but one out of an entire film is not too bad! -The acting is especially funny with James Franco and Randall Park, who played Kim. However Seth Rogan just played the SAME. FREAKING. CHARACTER. Yeah I hate him. Anyway.-The music was very Tarantino-esque, therefore I loved it.-The film had me laughing right off the bat and, aside from some parts that just weren't funny, was generally hilarious throughout. Even the ending was funny, satisfying, and overall well done.-The biggest negative is the content. It is a Seth Rogan comedy, so it is rated R. It is not that violent and only has some very brief, distant nudity. However, there is a lot of language in the film. There are some pretty iffy jokes, but it's mainly just language throughout that gives it its rating.-So if you don't mind language and are looking for an actually funny film that is entertaining and takes an original concept to great use, The Interview is totally worth seeing in thea- oh wait, nevermind. Well you can rent it on YouTube, to it is worth that! I would honestly give The Interview an 8/10. No joke."
tt2788710,6.0,"Saw this film recently and I must say that it doesn't quite live up to the hype that has been generated by all the talk of hacking into Sony. The film is essentially a buddy comedy where a talk show host played by James Franco and his producer played by Seth Rogen head to North Korea to interview Kim Il Un. Before they go the CIA however gives them the task of assassinating the leader. The movie plays on the opposites that are the characters with Franco's being a somewhat dumb, naive and hotheaded character with Rogen's being more level headed. A lot of the comedy is derived on the interaction and dialog of Rogen and Franco but it is here that I find it doesn't always work. Franco's character is just far too over the top, a bit obnoxious even, and just gets on your nerves quite quickly. The plot line gets pretty absurd quickly but that is of course to be expected. The film has it's moments and it is funny at times but I find it ends up being just mediocre and you keep wishing that Franco's character wouldn't speak as much. Passable entertainment but nothing spectacular. 6/10"
tt2788710,5.0,"I remember all the news around this film, how controversial it was. However once you watch it you see how pitiful and silly it really is. It also made me think of the shelf life of certain types of comedic films. The 80s and 90s gave us Adam Sandler, Chris Rock & also Rob Shneider who peaked in the 90s and early 2000s. The early 2000s then ushered in a new type of comedian with the likes of Seth Rogen, James Franco & Jonah Hill. They starred in over the top but different kind of films that were enjoyable. However whats happened to Adam Sandler's movies is starting to happen to Rogen and Franco. These silly and ridiculous plots with no sense aren't that original anymore. We've all seen a fair bit of them and the mindless fun and novelty has worn off. I am pleased I didn't spend money watching this in theater and saw it on Netflix instead."

It's quite watchable, despite a slowdown midway through.Seth Rogen is basically hilarious every time he's on screen, as much as it pains me to admit that. James Franco -as others have do doubt pointed out- is insufferable. He's plain annoying and unlikeable.This otherwise quite ordinary film will be viewed through the curious lens of foreign relations.

Blut's right hand man Vivian (Katheryn Winnick) lures Vizla to an ambush in Belarus.This is trying very hard to be an outrageous comic book movie. I don't mind it although Matt Lucas is more silly than threatening. It's not that he's funny either. The best part is the confrontation between Vizla and the kill team. It's the thrilling climax of the movie. The later action is not quite as compelling. I don't care about Blut and Vivian only slightly more. I only really love the team of killers. Once they're dead, the movie loses some of its punch. It's one movie where I wouldn't mind if it ends sooner. Vizla could vow revenge against Blut for the sequel who could send another team of killers. As it stands, the movie slowly fades with a few cool moves like Vizla waving his lazer fingers. The movie needs a better Blut if it wants me to be invested in his death."
tt0415306,6.0,"In Talladega Nights, Will Farrell and Jon C. Reilly head a nicely assembled cast (without a lot of star power) in a story about a fool who happens to be a race car driver and who has based his entire life philosophy around a phrase uttered by his alcoholic father during a drunk - ""If you ain't first, you're last"". Ricky Bobby rides high in his largely unexamined life until, predictably, he eventually crashes hard when confronted with a gay French intellectual who just might be a better driver than he is, and a boss who does not appreciate his arrogance.Talladega Nights uses a narrative and editing style reminiscent of the brilliant Deathrace 2000 to create an entirely different effect - unlike Deathrace 2000's intellectually challenging political and social commentary, Talladega Nights is a simple absurdist comedy played out by several stereotypes in the contemporary racing entertainment industry. The film is successful largely because of it's careful plotting and occasional substitution of slap-stick for (dumb) dialogue driven comedy. The script is nothing special, but was probably well edited in the final construction of the film in order to emphasize its occasional moments of brilliance. If you go into this without much in the way of expectations, you just might enjoy it."
tt0415306,5.0,I absolutely love Will Ferrel but this is his weakest outing ever. Ferrel has a high budget and one of the best supporting casts of the year to work with but he doesn't take advantage of what he is given. By mid way point the movie is Anchorman with a Nascar setting and new names. Sadly Ferrel has been playing the same character for a while. There are some moments of comedic brillianceut the rest of the film doesn't work. Ferrel can actually write a decent screenplay too bad he adds bits and pieces of nonsense when he could explore his characters a little more. It frustrates me knowing that Ferrel has the talent but he can't move on from playing SNL characters.
tt0415306,6.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. The three headed creative team of Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Judd Apatow obviously work very well together. Although ""T-Nights"" is not quite at the level of ""Anchorman"" or ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", it comes from the same gene pool and features some hilarious moments and great lines.Once again, Will Ferrell is the centerpiece of this one trick pony. Ferrell's best comedic traits are that we constantly expect him to say something funny and, even more importantly, he can deliver a straight line in a manner that causes laughter.Fans of the above mentioned movie will recognize most of the faces in the supporting cast. Receiving the most screen time are John C. Reilly as Ricky Bobby's life long Shake and Bake buddy, and Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G) as the nemesis gay French driver who pretty much drives Ricky Bobby over the proverbial edge. Also in the cast are Gary Cole (as Ricky Bobby's long lost Dad, who is NEVER without a beer), Jane Lynch (as Ricky's mom), Michael Clarke Duncan (as the crew chief), David Koechner (crew member) and Molly Shannon (as the sloshed car team owner's wife). Don't miss the nice performance from an almost unrecognizable Amy Adams (so wonderful in ""Junebug"") as one of Ricky Bobby's biggest supporters and his final love interest.The film basically delivers what it promises. A bunch of laughs and no real story to speak of. You do have to kind of like a film with a soundtrack that features both Roger Miller and AC/DC ... not to mention a french version of the Rolling Stones!! As always, stay for the closing credits for an extra chuckle or two."
tt0415306,6.0,"Trying to review and rate a movie like this is tougher than most might think. There are those Will Ferrell fans out there that'll eat up TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY. Then there are those that'll snub it as another foolish not-ready-for-prime-time-style spoof designed to engage our dumbed-down society. But there is a third reason someone might enjoy this rather ridiculous film.Hopefully there are those movie goers out there that enjoy watching parodies of various lifestyles, and this is where Talladega Nights gets most of  if not all of  its comedic punch. That we witness a southern Nascar driver with all of his conservative leanings hanging out for everyone to see was absolutely hysterical. Ricky Bobby's (Will Ferrell) big house, multiple gas guzzling cars (Hummers, etc.), a wife who's gauged on breast quality, and two kids named after a horrible action series (""These are my kids, Walker and Texas Ranger"") are all over-exaggerations on conservative values; you wouldn't dare see one of them driving a hybrid car, for instance.The entrance of a homosexual Frenchman named Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat) adds an additional element in the American prejudice category, Ricky Bobby bashing Girard's foreign heritage while making a fool of Americans' naiveté (""America gave the world Chinese food!"") The challenge of Ricky Bobby to overcome his fear of driving after a horrendous crash is only minimalist humor added to the film. It is, at its core, a spoof on modern southern lifestyle and conservatism, and that is what makes the movie work."
tt1591095,5.0,"INSIDIOUS is yet another one of those Hollywood ghost stories involving a possessed child. It follows a predictable format, with minor, isolated incidents gradually giving way to larger-scale, more pronounced apparitions and events before culminating in a full-scale onslaught of evil. And it's all rather silly.I enjoyed the first half of the movie. It's here where things are kept subtle and straightforward, with effectively creepy scare scenes and half-glimpsed figures spotted lurking in darkened rooms. So far, so good. But around the halfway mark, the film introduces a trio of paranormal investigators and things quickly descent into POLTERGEIST-style farce.The problem with depictions of a hellish limbo or netherworld is that, in order to make something scary, you have to pretty much identify with the different fears of each viewer. Sorry, but I don't find tussles with greasy-looking hobos and Darth Maul from THE PHANTOM MENACE to be particularly frightening; in fact, there's something pantomime about the whole thing.The actors, including the dependable Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson, do their best but at times in the latter stages they seem to struggle to keep a straight face while the ludicrous events increase in scale and speed. It's a shame that the whole thing goes to pot, because if it had been handled more sensitively (and with less sensationalism) by the team behind the SAW franchise then it could well have worked much better."
tt0102057,6.0,"Hook is a spin off of the classic tale of Peter Pan, you ever wonder what life would have been like for Peter Pan if he had grown up? If he had kids, a wife, and a career as a lawyer? Not very much, but it happens here in Spielberg's tale of the boy who never wanted to grow up. Hook is a pretty good film, it was definitely very imaginative and creative story wise. The sets and actors were absolutely perfect for this film; did you know that Michael Jackson originally wanted to play the role of Peter? Pretty creepy, huh? But Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman were so great together, I really enjoyed their performances. But the only actress I questioned was Julia Roberts as Tink, I'm not so sure if she was the best choice for the role. But that's just me, while the story seemed to drag on a bit, it was actually pretty good.Peter is a bit of a grown up who just can't seem to have fun in life, he misses his son's baseball games, doesn't spend much time with the family, and is always focused on work. But when he and his wife visit England with their kids to see Wendy, the lady who raised Peter when he was an orphan, his kids are kidnapped by Captain James Hook who wants to challenge Peter, but when Tink takes Peter back to Neverland, he needs major convincing that he is Peter Pan and is given three days to do so to get back his children. The Lost Boys try their best to make Peter bang-or-aign once again with them and that he'll get his kids back while learning the importance of youth.Hook is over all a good film that I would recommend to people. It's not at all a bad film, it has good drama in it along with great comedy. Most people love the dinner scene between Peter and Rufio, mine is Captain Hook explaining to Peter's kids why parents don't love children. Dustin's delivery of ""I want to potty, I want a cookie"" was just so perfect and funny. This is a good family film that I think you'll like, it's just an honest film with a fun story.6/10"

Indeed, the makeup, costumes and set design are top-notch. Some of the dialogue is pretty funny, particularly when Pan and Rufio get into a match of insults. And Dustin Hoffman really becomes Hook (Bob Hoskins is even more attached to Smee.) The overall story, although clever, tends to fall flat at times, with an overly predictable arc with more than just a dollop of sentimentality. Maybe one should not be too hard on the picture, but..."
tt0102057,6.0,"When l saw this movie in 1994 l've found it confuse and silly, after DVD advent l decided to re-watch hopeful to see something more which l probable missing in the past, but unfortunately l lost my valuable hours in this foolish movie, the big sets are fake, statics and awful, the whole idea to make this at sound stage struck the picture, Captain's Hook's ship never could be static, all the kids were used in wrong way, too corny sentimentalism spoils the story, who needs a father to see the games anyway, in my childhood l used to play football with my friends only, no father or mother nearby to give so endless lectures all the time, anyway so boring movie and too long, Hoffman as Hook deserves keep apart this mess!!Resume:First watch: 1994 / How many: 2 / Source: TV-DVD / Rating: 6"
tt0102057,6.0,"Hook presents us with the interesting and unusual phenomenon of Spielberg not getting it right.The idea is great - an adult Peter Pan, having eliminated the very notion of Neverland from his mind, has his children kidnapped by Captain Hook and has to return to Neverland where he rediscovers the childhood he had deliberately abandoned.And there is much to like about the film, not least of which are Dustin Hoffman's mannered Hook, and Maggie Smith's frail and aged Wendy.But when mistakes are made - and there are a number here - boy, are they whoppers! There are two huge casting mistakes among the principals. Julia Roberts is an absolutely awful Tinkerbell. Tinkerbell is a fairy, for heaven's sake. It's difficult to think of anyone more rooted in the real world than Julia Roberts, the least fairy-like actress I can think of (and whoever thought it would be a good idea to have a wincingly cloying scene of barely restrained loveydoveyness between Peter and Tinkerbell at the same size, should be locked up with no chance of ever getting near a word processor ever again. Preferably hide the pencils, too, just in case).And, I hate to say it, because I understand why it looked good on paper, Robin Williams is pretty awful too. If anything, Williams plays it too straight. I believe his uptight adult business man with not enough time for his kids, but I never believed his rejuvenated Pan.The Lost Boys don't convince, particularly the cockatoo-haired punk leader.The special effects fall in a clumsy halfway house between dream-like sheer fantasy and real life, and the set-bound interiors are too busy. The whole thing has a garish cast to it as if someone turned up the colour intensity on the TV.A misfire and, in Spielberg's filmography, only 1941 is a poorer effort."
tt0102057,6.0,"Look, I'd probably have liked Hook a lot more if I'd seen it as a kid. It feels mostly aimed at kids, which is a tiny bit disappointing, seeing as Spielberg's E. T. was a good movie when I saw it as a kid, and then it became a great movie when I watched it as an adult. I don't think the same can be said about Hook, even though it feels like there are things in this movie that feel like they should appeal to older viewers (Peter Pan is an adult here, after all... that's sort of the whole premise of the movie).I think Robin Williams was alright? Far from one of his best performances though - maybe he was a little miscast, because he sort of plays the straight man role, and most people around him are a little sillier. I buy him in comedies and dramas, but fantasy/adventure movies? It didn't work quite as well.Poor Maggie Smith. She's been playing super old ladies for decades now, I guess? Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins were both great though, and disappeared into their roles a surprising amount. Julia Roberts felt like another weird casting choice (the scene where she and Peter kiss is weird).I feel like being a little forgiving towards this movie. There's a lot wrong with it, but I feel like it would've been great if I was watching it 20 years younger than I am now, so for being a kid's movie, I want to hazard a guess and say it's a good one that I'm sure many people have fond memories of watching when they were younger."
tt0175142,5.0,"Scary Movie is now (it was a little while ago it was Me, Myself & Irene) my favorite comedy of the year.  This film gives another word to the spoof/comedy genre, and even though it doesn't make a breakthrough like Airplane!, it is still very, very funny. Sure it's not for everyone, but for those who have seen all the scary movies parodied in this film (example- Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, Halloween, The Shining, etc) and can enjoy a good comedy, this film is definitely for you.But the plot is unexplainable, but the jokes are.  The spoof follows in the Wayans bros. tradition (this film is directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, produced by all three, and starring all three) of they're last spoof- Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.  Jokes include a guy who acts very gay but isn't (Shawn Wayans) a pot head (Marlon Wayans) and some other characters (Carmen Electra's cameo is my favorite).  Also, the references to movies but not parodies are still funny.  Very sick, very crude, very funny.  The funniest film of the year. A+"
tt0175142,5.0,Scary Movie is a 2000 horror comedy spoof based on the 1996 slasher Scream. A group of people are being killed by a killer dubbed Ghostface and a young woman named Cindy (Anna Faris)and her friends (Shawn and Marlon Wayans and Regina Hall) must find out who is the killer.Overall it was a funny movie with a lot of silliness involved. I always liked the Wayan Bros(especially Shawn and Marlon Wayans) as they make a thing so stupid yet entertaining at the same time. Anna Faris looks unrecognisable with dark hair in this film. If you loved the Scream trilogy then you might enjoy this one. Thumbs up.
tt0175142,6.0,"I have heard for years about the first SCARY MOVIE but never got a chance of seeing it. However, on Christmas Eve I found it on Netflix and decided to give it a try. Now that I took this off my chest I can go to the review.In the beginning Drew Decker (Carmen Electra) is doing the exact same thing of Drew Barrymore in the beginning of SCREAM. Soon Ghostface arrives and it happens the same stuff of that 1996 classic, only in a funnier fashion. The movie has no real plot to speak of. From then, it's a lightning fast parody not only of SCREAM 1 and 2, but also of various other horrors or thrillers of those years. Some jokes are funny (especially the moment when Ghostface gets high with Marlon Wayans) and some, well, fall flat.Despite a few times I felt bored and thought the gags were juvenile, I still liked this film for its funny moments (including the ones aforementioned) and I am one of the few who thinks the sequels are better. Not an awful parody such as SILENCE OF THE HAMS or DISASTER MOVIE... just something in the ways of the two HOT SHOTS, not to be taken seriously."
tt1013752,6.0,"Once again, it follows the same plot points as some of the previous installments but Fast and Furious is still fun and its beginning to embrace the ridiculousness. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances and it's nice to see them back in the same film. John Ortiz is a really good villain. The action and car chases are also really good as usual."
tt1013752,6.0,"The drivers, the cars and the Drift races are the real stars of this movie , well directed on Mexico location , in Los Angeles , Long Beach , Pasadena, and Backlot Universal Studios. This is an exciting narration of drifting auto racing with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets and tunnels. Heading back to the streets where it all began, two men rejoin two women to blast muscle, tuner and exotic cars across Los Angeles and floor through the Mexican desert. When a murder brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dominic Toretto ( Vin Diesel ) reignites his confrontation with agent Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) . But as they are forced to fight a shared enemy named Campos ( John Ortiz ) and Fenix ( Laz Alonso ) , Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to vanquish him. They are helped by the Toretto's sister ( Jordana Brewster ), former Brian's girlfriend . And from convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across US-Mexican border , two contenders will find the best way to get vendetta : push the limits of what's possible behind the car .The picture blends action-packed, suspense , chills , tension , exciting car pursuits, thriller , a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV . Flashy, noisy race-cars set in Panama , California and Mexico by the producers , - the famous Neal Moritz - of the previous parts. Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency . All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage. Justin Lin's direction ( he previously made ¨ Annapolis ¨ and ¨Better Luck tomorrow¨ ) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas . Justin Lin directed the third part titled ¨Tokio drift¨ with Lucas Black and Sonny Chiba , the first and second entry were directed by Rob Coen with similar protagonists to this fourth outing. All of them were lavishly produced by Neal Moritz and also by Vin Diesel. The movie gives new meaning to the term ¨Tuning¨ and ¨Drifting¨. The flick will appeal to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely , it's a must see for cars fonds."
tt8633478,6.0,"I hadn't heard about the 2020 ""Run"" from writers Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian prior to getting to sit down to watch it. I looked it up on IMDb just before watching it, hoping to get an idea what I was in for; so I read the synopsis for the movie, but not any reviews.Normally I am not one to watch an abundance of thrillers, because the genre tends to be pretty much a dime a dozen, but still with the chance given to sit down to watch this particular movie, I did so.And I will say that director Aneesh Chaganty definitely delivered an entertaining movie. The storyline presented in the movie was one that had me thoroughly entertained, and I enjoyed how the writers kept me in the dark, letting me guess as to what was really going on. And director Aneesh Chaganty managed to reveal more and more of the actual happenings in small bits and pieces, which definitely left me wanting for more, and it was such a good sensation when it dawns upon you what is actually happening.""Run"" is a movie that is driven by some great acting performances by the two leads; that being Sarah Paulson (playing Diane, the mom) and Kiera Allen (playing Chloe, the disabled daughter). And since there weren't all that many people in the movie, the pressure of delivering was bigger for the leads, but they mustered this with excellence.The build up of the storyline is good and keeps you wanting more, and I like how the director just gradually feeds you bits and pieces of the storyline, as it makes for a very intense movie.I was definitely entertained by ""Run"" and it is a movie that was well-worth taking the time to sit down and watch. The ending of the movie, though, was just rubbish - pardon my bluntness here. But that ending was just ridiculous; and no, I am not revealing it, as you have to experience it yourself.My rating of ""Run"" lands on a well-deserved six out of ten stars."
tt8633478,6.0,"'Run' is a well crafted, tense thriller that hits you with shocking twist upon shocking twist.What happens when you suddenly don't trust your mom anymore, after she has lovingly taken care of you for 17 years? 'Run' explores this - with nail-biting suspense! This was creepy on a completely different level. The film's protagonist is Chloe, a paraplegic (excellently portrayed by real-life wheelchair bound actress Kiera Allen). Whenever a thriller features a character with a disability (or pregnant woman) the suspense is automatically elevated. 'Run' became more intense and suspenseful with every scene.Once the characters are set up, it doesn't take long before events take a turn for the worse, and Chloe realizes she's a prisoner within the confines of her own home. I don't want to do any spoilers, so I'm not going to delve too deep into the story. This is one of those movies where the ending couldn't come soon enough. Not because I didn't like it, but because it was so nerve wrecking that I could hardly contain my curiosity to see how it would end. Amazingly, the film simply never loses momentum. This is a rather disturbing psychological thriller, and one of the must-see films of 2020 (if you're into thrillers).Kiera Allan brilliantly carries the film, and Sarah Paulsen is superb as the mother, Diane. I thought 'Run' was excellent.Would I watch it again? Yes."
tt8633478,6.0,"Wow had no idea the actress was actually on a wheelchair in real life. Much respect. I'm confused.. why did the mother had marks on her Back? the last scene is so ridiculous and not in keeping with the girl's character. honestly thought this movie was dumb and unoriginal. complete rip off of misery, and the act. very predictable thriller. the story cheesy. I hate forced ""thrillers"" like this. Stories like this one always seem far fetched and a bit silly to me. It is full of plot holes. Some movie issues: No character development at all. They don't even have a dog but she gets tons of dog medicine. Those medications never came out in Chloe's blood tests? And many other medical and non medical related plot issues. BTW, no one cares for the poor mail man. Very contrived plot. The girl finds out facts very easily. Mother locks her in basement full of newspaper clips explaining the story. Really...?"
tt8633478,5.0,"Run is predictable and not great. The acting is fantastic, while the story is mediocre. The story does a wonderful job of being thrilling, but it mainly doesn't go anywhere. I knew everything that was going to happen even though I didn't know anything. However, There was one scene I enjoyed where Clare says, ""you need me."" The acting was just phenomenal in that specific scene.
Overall, it's a one time watch that you'll probably forget."

tt2404233,5.0,"Alex Proyas' ""Gods of Egypt"" is a film that is boldly and unabashedly silly and preposterous. Few other words can describe it. It has the pratfalls that beset typical Hollywood fare. It is already the subject of controversy due to its preeminently Caucasian cast. It has both critics and audiences sharpening their knives, a film supposedly destined for failure.Oh, but it works because the film truly bonkers. Truly insane. Truly out of its mind.Proyas, a gifted and visionary filmmaker, is renowned for having thought-provoking and striking imagery in all of his films, and this film is without exception. Where in any other film do you get to see goddesses horse-riding giant fire-breathing serpents? Or wagons carrying infinite amounts of gold dumping their load in a funnel-like tube ala dump trucks? Or for that matter, gods bleeding gold? Or Gerard butler riding gold- chromed giant beetles into battle? Or gods that have body parts that, when disfigured, instantly become detachable jewelry? Or...Admittedlly the plot is indeed silly even by blockbuster Hollywood standards, however a lesser Proyas film is still more visually inventive than the usual Hollywood movie factory output, and that is always a plus. Whereas a film like ""Pan"" bludgeons us over the head with its disgusting cynicism and disrespect for the source material by portraying its titular hero as a clichéd messiah figure, Proyas directs with the exuberance of a kid in Disneyland - with Disneyland replaced with an Egyptian museum exhibit – eager at the chance to create his own action packed tale while still respecting the gods as, well, gods.What is there to say about the plot, except that it has gods and it has Egypt? You get exactly what's on the tin. You get a chiseled hero in the form of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), his athletic and quippy comic sidekick (Brenton Thwaites) and beautiful love (Courtney Eaton), who set out to defeat Horus' evil uncle Set (Gerard Butler, simultaneously parodying his ""300"" persona while being supremely sinister).The whole thing sounds very Greek. But rather than eschewing the silly tone and making it ""Gladiator""-style dark and dreary ala the recent ""Clash of the Titans"" movies, Proyas and the actors let loose and have a ball with the material, never being too self aware while being silly enough to make for compelling viewing. Even rising star Chadwick Boseman (terrific in both ""42"" and ""Get on Up""), as Thoth the god of knowledge, relishes in chewing the scenery with every moment, never afraid of being campy. Not bad.Look, it's clear that the film is a B-grade Saturday night matinée film straight from the 1950s. Ever heard your grandparents told you about those? The ones where there's usually a double feature showcasing silly low budget sci-fi/horror/fantasy plots with handsome men and gorgeous gals, supremely cheesy one liners and having no purpose other than to put a goofy smile on your face from start to finish, almost guaranteeing a good time out? Well, this is one such movie, but with a blockbuster budget and the added pleasure of having Proyas wrapping the fun around with his wonderful thought-provoking visuals and production design, and going wild with this thing. Two set pieces involving a gigantic worm-like demon and the Egyptian afterlife are visual marvels, triumphs of set design and visual effects, evoking senses of awe and wonder like films from yesteryear and other gifted visionaries. For mainstream filmmakers, CGI is the cheat sheet. For Proyas, it's his toy box. This is eye candy on a spectacular scale, and audiences won't get short-changed.Bear with me here, but if you were to replace the cast with genuine Egyptian actors, I think the film would be mired in even bigger controversies because it will definitely look more inaccurate and seemingly insulting than it supposedly already is. It's stupid, yes, but it's gloriously stupid and never succumbs to taking itself ever so seriously. Proyas sort of knew what he was doing here, and he didn't give a damn about what others thought. And that's the kind of filmmaker I admire the most."
tt2404233,6.0,"For some strange reason I was wishing for a big budget over the top version of Land of the Pharaohs (1955), with a bit of Cleopatra (1963) and Jason and the Argonauts (1963) thrown in. And true to form, it came pretty close to the campiness of those films! Apart from the storyline, this spectacular action adventure sure delivers in the CGI department and creative sound design. It's one for the big screen and thumping speakers, insulting your senses in a most pleasurable masochist way.Director Alex Proyas mostly delves in dark films where ""The End Is Nigh"". These dark themes were noticeable in Spirits of the Air, Gremlins of the Clouds (1989), The Crow (1994) and Dark City (1998). They even had it's moments in the Hollywood blockbusters I, Robot (2004) along with The Knowing (2009). With Gods of Egypt, it almost felt like it wasn't an Alex Proyas film. Maybe a bit too spectacular for his style, but he managed to fit moments in where he got to play with his dark-side, mostly evident in the ""Afterlife"" scenes. In this film, Alex got to create his vision with perfection, thanks to today's technology. Hopefully he'll be able to use that on his next project, maybe something a little darker, a bit more Proyas than Hollywood.What saved this film from its own corniness is the talent it attracted. Gerard Butler is perfect as Gerard Butler the brute! Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau gets to play around with his Game Of Thrones character, Jamie, by adding a little more manliness to it. The surprise of the lot was the mortal, Bek, played by the Aussie cutie, Brenton Thwaites. He supplied the wit and charm desperately needed in this. Even the Aussie icons, Bryan Brown and Geoffrey Rush came along for the ride. What they both managed to do was play it perfectly straight, in a theatrical way, that suited the style of this film. You noticed the tone of the film changed when Rush was on screen with Butler or Nikolaj. The level went up a notch, and it was momentarily intriguing. (And see if you can spot another Aussie icon, Bruce Spence:)The true winner of this epic film is the ""Gamer"". This film has all the elements a Gamer would love. It has dangerous mazes our heroes have to get through, and thrilling combating scenes captured by frantic maneuvering cameras. If the film does well at the box office I'm sure there will be a game following hot on its heels.I must admit I was surprised how entertaining this film was. Maybe because I saw it on the big screen and was distracted by the incredible CGI and sound design. The story was pleasing enough, it has the Game Of Thrones element where characters you least expected to perish did. There was the Lord Of The Rings journey and a bit of everything else you might have seen if you love your big action adventure films. And not to forget the romantic element which played heavily in our heroe's destination. I think the studio executives got ever audience angle covered."
tt1298650,5.0,"The BadI'm sure my surroundings had a lot to do with my enjoyment of the film, or lack thereof, but even without that it wasn't up to the high standard that I regard the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films. The plot was flaky and apart from Jack, the characters weren't that great.After seeing Ian McShane in Deadwood I was convinced he'd make a fantastic Blackbeard, but I think his Lovejoy character was more evil than he was in On Stranger Tides. At the height of his devilishness (is that even a word?) he triggered his ship's flamethrower to kill a mutineer and gave us doubts over his true feelings to a daughter he'd only just found out about. He wasn't a patch on the Barbosa/Davey Jones/Lord Beckett trifecta of evil from the first three films. As someone once said, Luke Skywalker was only as good as Darth Vader was evil.Speaking of the daughter, Penelope Cruz as Angelica was a character I felt very apathetic towards. The whole raison d'etre of her quest to find the Fountain of Youth was because it had been foretold that a one legged man would kill her father and she wanted to save him so she could have that father she never heard. I'm sorry but pass me the bucket - that sentimental dross deserves to be on Jeremy Kyle (Oprah Winfrey for anyone reading from the US) not as the main plot for the latest of one of the biggest film franchises of all time.The dilemma at the end of the film sees both Blackbeard and Angelica about to die and only one can be saved by the Fountain of Youth. At that point I didn't care if either died and why should I? Blackbeard is an evil man, or so they tell us, and Angelica has used Jack to get to the Fountain of Youth. If I were Jack I'd have left them both to die and the film would have been better off if he had. At least then we'd have some of the darker side of Jack which never showed appeared in this film. Instead our scoundrel played a goody two shoes who seemed to be motivated by his concern for Angelica's safety. Please, this is Jack Sparrow we are talking about, like he really gives a damn about anyone apart from himself, a characteristic which made him so appealing in the previous films. Yes, he does have a softer side that we've seen before, but to not this whipped extent.Don't even get me started on the Mermaids. They were great to start with, but as soon as it was just Syrena and her boring relationship with Philip the clergyman, all was lost as they gave us the dullest moments in Pirates of the Caribbean history, to date.My last major moan is about the part where Jack left Angelica on the island. Remember, Angelica's whole motivation was to save her father, and Jack had just condemned him to death. So why in God's name, when his back was turned, did she try to attack him with a piece of wood and not shoot him in the back with the pistol he had just given her? Yes she had some feelings for Jack, but surely not enough for her to get over the fact that Jack had basically just killed her father and destroyed what she had spent the whole film trying to achieve? Don't give me the old 'he saved her life' spiel – Jack let Blackbeard , her father, die - end of story.The GoodWhilst nowhere near as funny as in the previous films Jack was still a great character, in spite of his wimpy attitude change. The scenes where he escaped from the King and the clutches of the Spanish were a reminder of how great Pirates of the Caribbean can be at its best. It was great to see Gibbs back alongside Jack as their chemistry is great and a nice link back my beloved first three films.As always, the film looked and sounded great, though the 3D wasn't essential and I found myself taking the glasses off from time to time and it made little difference. In fact I'd go as far as to say that while you lose depth in 2D, you gain richness in colour.I'm struggling to think of much else to compliment the film for and at the moment I'm stuck in my post viewing disappointment funk. I really need to watch it again but after my horrific cinema experience I'll wait until it comes out on Blu-ray."
tt1298650,6.0,"In London, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escapes from the soldiers that are chasing him and learns that an impostor is recruiting a crew and a vessel using his name. He meets the impersonator and finds that she actually is Angelica (Penélope Cruz), a woman that he had seduced in a convent in Seville. Jack is abducted and when he awakes aboard, the ship is sailing, Angelica tells him that her father, the pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), is cursed and he needs to find the legendary Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth to save his life. They force Jack, who knows the location of the fountain, to guide them. Meanwhile, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is hired by King George to lead the British crew and dispute against the Spaniards and Blackbeard who arrives first in the fountain. But along their dangerous quest, they need to find first two chalices that belonged to Ponce de Leon and a tear of mermaid. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is a disappointed adventure of a washed up franchise. I have just watched this film with my wife and son on DVD and we three had taken naps along the 136 minutes running time. The film has good cast but without Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom; top-notch special effects but the problem is the boring and weak story. I hope the producers have the decency to stop this franchise. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Piratas do Caribe: Navegando em Águas Misteriosas"" (""Pirates of the Caribbean: Navigating in Mysterious Water"")"
tt1298650,6.0,"In movies, as in marriage, the fourth go-around can get a little tricky. As the fourth round approaches there's an apprehension of what has come before and what is new that is left to be discovered. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the third sequel in Disney's highly-successful series, is not a movie that I went into with much anticipation. Yet, as I always do, I allowed myself to be open minded (you never know when a movie will surprise you) and I found the movie quite enjoyable.My apprehension comes from the experience of the previous films, which I complained were too long and so overwritten as to become convoluted. That's not good for what should be a simple pirate movie. Having left behind many of the familiar characters (Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly and Jonathan Price are absent this time), the movie is free to find new characters and a new arena to play in. With that, this is a kind of trimmed down POTC movie.The movie finds the ever-plucky sea-going rascal Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) once again in trouble with the King's court and about to be executed. That is, until one of his crew produces a map to the fabled Fountain of Youth, rumored to have been found 200 years before by the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León. Jack makes a spectacular escape and the race is on race to find the fountain, which is headed off first by the Spanish fleet and then by the British fleet. Trailing them are Jack and his nemesis Captain Barbossa (Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush), who is a privateer under the orders of King George II (Richard Griffiths). Then there is Angelica (Oscar winner Penelope Cruz), who is first mate on the ship captained by Blackbeard (Ian McShane) - whose beard is actually gray, but never mind.The plot to get to the fountain of youth is probably more complicated than it needs to be. Getting to the fountain is easy enough, but then we learn that it is not a simple matter of taking a dip and becoming younger, no. First, Jack learns, you must first get two goblets belonging to Ponce de León, then you have to mix it with the tears of a mermaid, then (I think I have this right), one person has to drink from one cup to become younger and then another person has to drink from the other and they will die. Something along those lines. As I said, it is more complicated than it needs to be.The plot, as in the previous installments, is somewhat superfluous. There really isn't a need to get to the fountain of youth. There probably wasn't any need for mermaids that can suck your blood, nor, all that stuff about voodoo and shrinking massive ships until you can fit them into bottles. Yet, what I have learned about this series is that the plot really doesn't matter. These films are constructed more as a series of set pieces rather than a narrative plot. I appreciated the mermaids but, this being a Disney film, the all-out boob-fest that should have ensued sadly never materializes.What keeps this series popular is quality control. Johnny Depp maintains the same swagger and slurry charm that he had in the previous films. He keeps from taking the film too seriously but avoids the temptation to make fun of the character. The first film got him his first Oscar nomination, and justifiably so. Eight years, and three sequels later, Depp maintains the fun spirit of the character and doesn't allow it to grow routine. Neither does Geoffrey Rush, in his third go-around as Captain Barbossa, which he plays with an evil wink and a pirate accent that he practically chews on. Penelope Cruz gives a nice performance here and proves - to me at least - that she should have been the female protagonist of the series all along instead of Kiera Knightly. Yet, I was surprisingly underwhelmed by Ian McShane's performance as Blackbeard. McShane is a wonderful actor but somehow Blackbeard seems subdued. He is pure evil, right down to the buckles on his boots but the character doesn't leap out with the lip-smacking vileness that I had hoped. The movie pins the character down as if they are introducing him to be in a future movie.""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is probably the best of the series since the first one. That is thanks to a leaner script and, mercifully, a shorter running time (it is actually an hour shorter than the last one). I could complain about it all day long, but I would rather confess that I was more entertained by this film than I was by the previous two.Disney has found a gold mine with this series. Convoluted as these movies are, they do have an audience and I am glad to see anything that gets movie fans excited. Yet, there is a feeling that this series may be wrapping up. Johnny Depp has said that he is growing tired of playing Jack Sparrow (although it does not come out in his performance) and that may bring about an end to this ""Pirates"" series. With that, I started thinking that maybe Disney would do well to move on to something else, maybe Treasure Island, Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, Moby Dick. Maybe the same fun-loving spirit that made this series so popular could be given to those classics as well."
tt1298650,6.0,"It did feel like Stanger Tides was actually part 5, and we skipped over part 4.First off, I'll say the film was solid. The mermaid sequences were stunning, Blackbeard was stellar in every way, and I loved the twist ending with the surprise motivation of the Spanish.But as for the rushed feeling, for one, there are a number of things we are just told to accept from the beginning of the film such as Barbossa having the peg leg and being in the British service,,,,, OK,,, perhaps not that big of a deal, but what about this, Cruz's character has come to accept Black Beard as her father. Fair enough, but wouldn't that have been much more powerful if we had gotten to know each character first and then in a ""Luke I am your father"" moment seen her learn that he was in fact her father. Instead, we're just told that she's learned this and any build up to the discovery is hacked off at the knees.But more importantly perhaps was the lack of character development in some areas. Most specifically with our new priest. Why was he there again? It's not really clear. And for the love story between he and the mermaid, which was in effect taking the place of the displaced couple of previous films, the pair felt extremely underdeveloped.Likewise was the back story of Cruz and Depp. I mean it was there, they did mention it, but it just didn't really resonate as significant.NOW, those two issues can be resolved by a future film, and should a 5th film bulk up the characters of Cruz & the priest and their motivations and/or relationship with Depp, then this film will grow stronger in retrospect, but as it stands now, it just felt like either they were underdeveloped, or that their back story deserved more than an ""oh by the way"" and perhaps should have been explored previously, before embarking on this story itself."

The movie has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , tongue-in-cheek , adventures , romance and is pretty amusing . Although is a little revisionist about characters , personages and time where is developed the action in a dirty , gritty Middle Age, spectators partially disapproved the changes of classic canon . Seven years later to ¨Fandango¨ film , director Kevin Reynolds and Kevin Costner re-teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes , hopefully without coming to blows themselves . Kevin Costner is fine but Morgan Freeman comes up the film as the civilized and naive Moor brought by Robin from Crusades . Special mention to Alan Rickman as an evil and crazed sheriff in a comic and sensationalistic interpretation . Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is memorable and attractive .

tt0102798,6.0,"Wow, this film seems to have annoyed some people. What a fuss about it being historically inaccurate, or that Azeem found the Chinease invention of gunpowder etc etc. WHO CARES! Don't nit pick at a film like this and you'll enjoy it. As for Kevin Costner not having an English accent, I don't really care, since it's a lot better then the other Robin Hood movie that was made in England, and was unlucky enough to be released at the same time. (I think it was simply called 'Robin Hood') OK,so Robin Hood IS supposed to be English, and yeah, Kev Costner could at least have tried an English accent, but if we're going to go that far, then they may as well have got an English actor instead of an American one, but somehow, I don't think Costner could have been bettered. He makes an excellent Robin Hood. Alan Rickman is brilliant as the hilarious Sherrif of Nottingham ('Shut up you TWIT!')It's great fun, and one of those film to watch with your feet up and a big bar of chocolate....."
tt0102798,5.0,"...is what a commercial advertising the 1938 version of Robin Hood had to say in the summer of 1991 regarding the advertisement for this film claiming ""This summer Kevin Costner is Robin Hood"". The voice of the pronouncement was from the actor that defined the role of Robin Hood and the role of the swashbuckler in general - Errol Flynn.Not only does Kevin Costner not sound like Robin Hood, he doesn't act like him either. His performance doesn't even come close to that of Flynn. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is good enough in her performance as Marian, but still you can't compare the chemistry between Errol Flynn and Olivia De Haviland to whatever is there between 1991's Marian and Robin. Do note that this version does show more of the tragedy that befalls the peasants than was present in the 1938 version. This emphasis on tragedy and drama is probably there to offset the fact that since Kevin Costner can't even begin to swash Errol Flynn's buckle, and comes across more like a social worker who is good at archery, the film had to take the emphasis off of the great fun and energy of Robin Hood himself.The one saving grace of this film is Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham. His use of the black arts is shown openly as was not possible in the 1938 version, demonstrating the true evil measure of the man, and at the same time he gets off some great comic one liners and manages to steal the picture. Claude Raines, who played Prince John in the 1938 version, would have been proud of this performance.If you want to see an intentionally comic rendition of Robin Hood, see Mel Brooks' ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"". That movie succeeded at least partially by playing off some of the ludicrous aspects of this one."
tt0102798,5.0,"Saying a Kevin Costner movie is bad is kind of like saying cheese smells. It just does.To be fair, some of his films have been quite good... ""Open Range,"" ""Field of Dreams,"" ""The Untouchables,"" ""No Way Out""...you could do worse than watch these films.But he's made far more bad films than good ones...and I think he's simply a very bad actor and films like this solidify that. It seems Costner has a huge ego and always takes on these ""epic"" revisionist or revisionist future films like ""The Postman"" and ""Waterworld"". ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" (err, I mean, ""Prince of Thieves"") is quite similar. It's a whole ""new"" spin on the Robin Hood tale. And it stinks. (Almost as bad as cheese.) The cast is otherwise pretty good. You've got Alan Rickman as a villain and that's always a plus. Sean Connery has a cameo, too.But come on, Morgan Freeman in a Robin Hood film? I hate to break the news to everybody but Robin Hood didn't have any black pals called Azeem (if he did then I apologize sincerely but since I read the book and don't recall an African emigrant being mentioned, I'm sticking to my guns).I understand they have to have blacks in the film so they don't appear to be ""racist."" I'm not racist and Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors ever but come on...would you put an Asian guy named Heroshima in a film about George Washington and the Revolution? Would you have him become George's best buddy and offer insightful advice? NO! Somehow I just find this film to be quite dull and plodding and over-long. Political correctness aside (and trust me, there's plenty) it's simply LIFELESS...ironically appropriate given that Kevin Costner's voice never fails to put me to sleep.Overall you could do much better - go watch the original Michael Curtiz version (one of the greatest ever and certainly the best Robin Hood film adaptation), the Disney cartoon (aw come on it's entertaining) or the Mel Brooks version. Combined together they're all better than this - which is saying a lot considering Brooks' ""Men in Tights"" was a bad film to begin with."
tt6857112,5.0,"When Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) returns to Santa Cruz, the site of a childhood trauma, with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), she finds her family stalked by a group of doppelgängers intent on doing them harm.My initial thought: that's no way to play whack-a-mole. You don't just stand there and hit the same mole over and over. Couldn't the actor be bothered? Still, I'm a reasonable person and can let that slide just so long as the rest of the film is good.Unfortunately, it turns out that iffy whack-a-mole tactics are the least of this film's problems.Character development is fine-I liked the central family, and their obnoxious friends were fun, but once the shadow people appear, it all starts to go a bit pear-shaped...I understand that the home invasion scene is intended to be dark comedy, which I'm fine with, but I'd liked to have had some genuine tension and a few solid frights along the way. At no point did I feel scared, which is disappointing when you've signed on for a horror movie. I also don't understand why the doppelgängers don't kill the family straight away (other than for the convenience of the plot), but that's just one puzzler amongst many.Peele finally hits his horror stride with the attack at the neighbours' home, and the fight against the shadow twins, but once it becomes apparent that the phenomena is nationwide, the film takes a serious nosedive. Rather than leave the nature of his villains mysterious, Peele gives us a ridiculous back story to the shadow people that makes very little sense whatsoever.The viewer is expected to believe in the creation of thousands, nay millions, of underground shadow people who control the population above through puppetry. These people live in a network of tunnels and, so I understand, eat raw rabbit meat. This premise leaves countless unanswered questions, none of which are adequately addressed. It's a half-assed attempt at an explanation which would have been best left unsaid.Peele then expects us to swallow the idea that the countless shadow people have been organised into an army by Adelaide's evil doppelgänger. Clad in red jumpsuits and armed with scissors (acquired from a subterranean red jumpsuit and golden scissors warehouse, no doubt), she plans for her people to invade the world above. To what end? To overpower their more privileged doubles and then hold hands in a chain across America, as an act of defiance and solidarity.All of this is intended as a metaphor for class divide in America, mirroring the fight between the haves and have-nots, and the struggle for equality, but the subtext comes at the expense of logic and narrative cohesion. Peele closes matters with a silly twist ending that only raises further awkward questions.My closing thought: could have been great, but the whack-a-mole incident is just the start of it."
tt6857112,6.0,"Jordan Peele is at it again!Hard to say too much about this one without spoiling, but here goes.
The acting is good, especially considering many of the actors plays two roles. They all do a bang up job in that regard. So no trouble so far.
The movie looks good. I have no complains here either. It's technically very well made. We always see what's going on, no shaky cam or anything like that. Some nice shots too.
The humor works pretty well, the dialogue comes off as natural.
I like the beginning of the movie, the family is pretty likable.
The movie is sort of a mystery, and when the mystery unravels is when we get to some slight problems. The scrips seems to be based on a pretty good idea, that was never thoroughly worked out. It just isn't thought all the way through.
I am left with several questions, and not in a good way.
This is spoiler terriroty, so I won't go into detail, but it didn't sit well with me. Doesn't seem to make sense. The plot has more holes than a swizz cheese. (that almost no critics talk about this is very strange)Now, in the movies defence, the sub-genre it turne out to be is very far from my favorite, so others might like it better. I've seen a lot of horror movies, and this is just not one of the best ones. It is mediocre.
Not a weak movie, but definitely no classic. Will not be watching it again."
tt6857112,6.0,"I hate saying this, but this film is the product of when you've got incredible everything and an underdeveloped script. The concepts are great, but lose their value and appreciation because there is so much with so little explanation, leaving me with the impression that they were not completely thought-out.
Acting was incredible, cinematography, lighting, set design, and sound track were wonderful too! It's just that the script and story does not fully deliver. It's so conceptual that it loses horror, yet so rushed in execution that it loses coherence."
tt6857112,5.0,"I am sure that this review is going to get a ton of down votes and I am pretty sure that all those 10/10 reviews are bot accounts (if you dont believe me check the profiles) so I wont spent much time analyzing the film. Many many plot holes,little substance and ultimately you have a movie with a weak script based on a good idea that takes itself way to seriously without achieving even half of what it promises. Get out worked that well because it didn't take itself that seriously and there was always an underlying tone of dark comedy to it. It gets a 5 because I liked the cinematography and I thought that the performances where actually quite good!"
tt6857112,6.0,"Trailer was better than the movie. To me this movie just never takes off. It's a shame because there is some fantastic imagery and a wonderful theme lying underneath but in the end it can not overcome its plot holes and failed delivery of the message its trying to speak. It truly believes it's deeper than it is, but left me unfulfilled. Kind of lazy/rushed writing in my opinion. Kind of just throws a bunch of mediocre stuff at you without any real substance and expects the audience to give it purpose and deeper meaning in there own heads. Which is fine to do but to me this movie wasn't worthy of that merit of thought. You keep waiting for it to evolve but it just never does. Honestly can't believe critics are putting this on such a pedestal giving it such rave reviews."
tt6857112,5.0,"I wanted to like this movie, I was so excited about the trailer and I like the idea behind it, it's very original... but it simply didn't happed. Although we can say that Jordan Peele is a filmmaker who thinks outside the box and brings important and strong subjects, I thought the movie was poorly developed. I need to believe in what I'm watching, but there are so many plot holes and inconsistencies that the whole experience was damaged. The metaphors are confusing, the explanations are flat and forced, the writing felt really lazy to me.
And to add, I thought the mix of comedy and horror, that can be made in very harmonic ways, was unbalanced. All the time the comedic moments came up to break the tension, so I was not able to get scared at all and I wanted to be.
Nevertheless, I'd like to point out the amazing acting of Lupyta. Her delivery is always intense and strong, no matter which character she is playing. And I hope Peele keeps his originality, but learns to develop better narratives in the future."
tt6857112,6.0,"Us is a puzzling film that slowly reveals its layers but then becomes more illogical and confusing.It is better to not think about too deeply and just enjoy the ride. It means you lose any subtext the filmmaker had about a society of us and the others.The film opens at the funfair in the boardwalk of Santa Cruz in 1986. A small girl, Adelaide is on holiday and wanders off while her father is playing whack-a-mole. As she enters a funhouse she sees a doppelgänger of herself in the hall of mirrors. This encounter left her unable to communicate for some time and still affects her in the present day.We then cut to the present day when Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) is vacationing at their summer home in Santa Cruz with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two children Zora and Jason.One evening the Wilsons see another family that looks exactly like them standing outside the house decked out in red overalls. They look like they mean to harm them and they are somehow tethered to the soul of the individual Wilson family members.The doppelgängers all grunt except for Red, Adelaide's double who speaks with a raspy voice. Red tells Adelaide that both of them are tethered together and share a soul. These doubles live in a subterranean underground world.As an home invasion horror it is very effective and chilling, we find out that other families are being slaughtered by their doubles. It leads to a problem. Why are the Wilsons being toyed with when other families are being brutally killed and the violence is spreading as the doubles attempt to enact their own Hands across America.The moment the film broadens its premise it starts losing it logic. Even when the family try to get away from Santa Cruz and head down to Mexico, after driving all night they are somehow still in Santa Cruz. I've been to Santa Cruz it is not that big!Jordan Peele tries to underpin his film with some kind of explanation and symbolism but it is half baked. He also wants to tie the film together by making it all about Adelaide. Unlike Get Out there is little humour in this film although Gabe is meant to be a dorky dad."
tt6857112,5.0,"This is a movie of two halves. The first half is a pretty decent suspense thriller, in a confined environment, where you don't really know what's going on and then, just when you think it's ending, there's a whole other half in a different setting that's significantly less good where they make the fatal mistake of trying to actually explain the highly unlikely goings on.As a result it feels like the film has about 6 acts instead of the usual 3, and by the time it ends you don't really care anymore as instead of being a tightly plotted thrill ride, the writers continue to throw all sorts of ideas at you in the hope that some of them will work, each less well thought out than the last.If they stuck to just the initial setting and maintained some mystery it could have been awesome, but as it is it just goes on too long and loses focus at around the half way point."
tt0337741,6.0,"Romance among the AARP set in a movie is never an easy proposition, pardon the pun. The participants have to be sexy enough that the younger people in the audience don't get all grossed out (""Gramma and Granpa are KISSING!!! With tongue!!!!""), but not too sexy. The audience wants to be swept off its feet, but it doesn't want anything that's overly salacious.For the most part, writer-director Nancy Meyers succeeds here. Diane Keaton plays Erica Barry, a neurotic, highly successful playwright. Jack Nicholson plays himself. Okay, technically he plays 63-year-old Harry Sanborn, owner of a hip-hop record label and chronic womanizer.One of the funniest scenes in the movie comes right near the beginning. Harry's with his new squeeze Marin (Amanda Peet), at Marin's mom's house. There's Harry, in his boxers and a t-shirt, putting wine in the 'fridge, when Marin's mom - you guessed it, Erica - unexpectedly comes home. Naturally, she thinks he's an intruder and calls 911. I mean, wouldn't you? It takes some explaining, but soon the misunderstanding is cleared up and our combatants (oops, participants) can get on with the romancin'.The thrust of the story (oops, another pun) is that while fooling around with Marin upstairs, Harry suffers a heart attack. At the hospital, Dr. Mercer (an interestingly cast Keanu Reeves) admonishes the unrepentant Harry for overexerting himself and tells him not to travel for a little while. Yup, you guessed it, that means he has to bunk with Erica. And our romance is thus set up.The good news is that pairing Keaton and Nicholson (who appeared together in 1982's Reds) was a great, great idea. Keaton basically plays a grown-up Annie Hall, and she manages to look sexy and daffy at the same time. Nicholson, for all his bluster and creakiness, still has the panache that has served him so well for the past forty years or so.The trouble is that after their relationship is consummated, the two leads behave like seventh graders. Now, no offense to you seventh graders out there, but you do have a tendency to get melodramatic. Admit it. In this movie, Erica spends - no exaggeration here - a good ten minutes sobbing. And sobbing. And sobbing. Everywhere and anywhere. Yikes and double yikes. For his part, Harry broods like no one's ever brooded before, like he's up for an Olympic medal in the event of Feeling Bummed Out. After a while, you wish these two crazy kids would just get over it. Call her! Call him! Do something!To make matters worse for the relationship, Erica writes a play based on her experiences with Harry, complete with him dancing drunkenly in a hospital gown. Does this lady play hardball, or what?Granted, the storyline is predictable, but the two leads are wonderful, and very well cast. Meyers wrote the script with Keaton and Nicholson in mind specifically, the decision was a wise one.Something's Gotta Give has a funny beginning and a sweet ending, but the middle suffers from an unfortunate lag."
tt0337741,6.0,"I saw first saw Something's Gotta Give, the new film by Nancy Meyes and starring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, a month ago.  I wasn't sure whether I liked it, or though it was so-so, or even thought it was a drop off from the work I've seen Nicholson do lately (The Pledge and About Schmidt are wonderful works for the legend).  I saw it again tonight and I think I feel slightly different about it now.  It's not a bad movie, but I wouldn't watch it in a theater again, and I might flip around when it comes on TV to see the good scenes.  It's the kind of romantic comedy that suffers from a couple of downers, and yet there is a charm to it that should appeal to fans of the actors, and to older audiences (as I suspected over half of the audience was over the age of 50).  The good that's in the movie is that it's a sort of standard Hollywood-style story that doesn't go into rotten territory like other romantic comedies do. Nicholson plays a version of himself (a version of the truth?) as Harry, a record company executive who's dating a woman half his age (Amanda Peet). While staying at her mother's house at the Hamptons he meets both her playwright mother Erica (Keaton) and teacher aunt (Frances McDormand). Then, he gets hit with a heart attack, and is told by the doctor (Keanu Reeves) to stick around as to not get overly tensed by what he's struck down with.  Then the sparks being to come up between Harry and Erica when they're left to themselves while Harry recovers.  The things that make the film work are that Nicholson and Keaton have a nice connection to each other, like one of those old Hollywood star-couples in the old-time Hollywood movies.  I could've imagined the Harry role played by someone else, and maybe for Keaton too, but the way it turned out it's about right as a stars' vehicle.  And there are plenty of laughs that come up involving Nicholson after the heart attack (the biggest for me came minutes after his first heart attack, when he tries to walk around), and with consistent sexual puns and wit.  What didn't work for me was the Hollywood-style romanticism and direction the sob parts of the story and characters went to that were much, much better under the control of someone like James L. Brooks in the classic As Good As It Gets.  In that film Nicholson played a version of himself, too, but that character and story had an edge to it all that could make it totally re-watchable for women as well as men.  As for Keaton, she holds her own quite well next to her counter-part, and she looks terrific, though for some reason seeing what the script required her to do in a role like this makes me really want to see her in a Woody Allen flick again.  The acting by Reeves was another glaring flaw, reminding me that he's much better off in Matrix and action-film land than here- every time he had a romantic moment I cringed in my seat.  There were also supporting roles by Peet and McDormand that were under-used. 
Still, I do sorta, kinda recommend Something's Gotta Give- it has humor that isn't too raunchy (unless you get offended by heart-attack and viagra jokes), and as a chick flick it does fine.  In some ways it could've been better, and in other ways there was no way it could've tried for better ground, and there were some touches that made it tolerable and watchable. (strong) C+"

Quite a bit is left out when you read a list of Annie's adventures in that period. But the film Annie captures the essence of what she was about. One thing though she never grew up staying a plucky and resourceful orphan with her benefactor Daddy Warbucks the Howard Hughes of the funny papers who had endless money. Young Aileen Quinn is our Annie and Daddy Warbucks is Albert Finney. The film is an adaption of the Broadway Musical that ran for six years and 2377 performances. It hadn't even finished it's Broadway run when the film came out. The film plot concerns Daddy Warbucks inviting a selected orphan out to the fabulous Warbucks estate and Annie gets to be the lucky girl. She gets to him with her innocent charm and plucky attitude.But the mean woman who runs the orphanage who is played with delicious panache by Carol Burnett wants to exploit the situation to her own advantage. Burnett enlists her conman brother Tim Curry and his wife Bernadette Peters. What they do and how Annie triumphs over all is for you to see the film.I'm not sure John Huston was the right choice to direct this, but Busby Berkeley was not available. Probably with a musical or two under his belt Huston might have made a classic. As it is it's not a bad film, just not a great one.In fact this adaption of a cartoon was really perfected by Warren Beatty when he created his Dick Tracy film. That's how you adapt a cartoon as a cartoon to film with live actors.Still Annie got a couple of Oscar nominations for adapted musical score and Art&Set Direction. I wish Burnett had been given recognition when she's on the film really takes off.A good musical with a good adaption for family viewing."

And despite several decent action scenes (including booby-trap pods, a tidal wave of tar, and a mutt attack) that's precisely what has happened: at a whopping 137 minutes, this last film in the series feels like the proverbial dead horse has been well and truly flogged.I watched purely for the sake of completion, but at no point did I feel involved in the story or engaged with the characters. I just sat there waiting for the whole thing to end so I could move on to something else. A shame, because if they had taken the good bits from both Mockingjay movies and combined them into one (slightly longer) film, it might have been the best of the series and a fitting finalé for Katniss and co."

For much of the film it reminded me of Frodo's (boring) journey to destroy the ring except that Frodo actually does get there in the End. Katniss sets off to kill the president and spends most of the film trying to get there but then doesn't, in fact she is beaten by the resistance, who managed to get through all of those traps that she could not and still get there quicker. She then wakes up to find the war is over. The twist at the end is so well signposted that it doesn't take much inferring leaving the happy ever after.Special effects and infinite arrow archery skills ultimately don't make up for the lack of story and obvious plot holes.

Anyway, that aside, after watching, and enjoying, the first movie a part of me really wanted to see what happens in the sequel. Well, yeah, it is more of the same, but it still has that rather nice feel good aspect to it.So, Lenny Feder and his family have decided to leave Hollywood and move back to their home town, though they do end up buying one of the biggest houses on the block. Lenny isn't working, but you get the impression that he really doesn't need to because, well, he has plenty of money as it is. Mind you, you also get the impression that his wife's fashion store isn't doing all that well either, but she doesn't seem to particularly care.It is the last day of school before the summer holidays, and of course it is a time for people to come to terms with a time era. Lenny has to confront the idea that his wife wants a fourth child, Marcus has to confront the fact that he has a boy, though this particular boy really doesn't seem to like him. Of course, there is also the issue that they aren't young like they were, and the local frat boys are out causing trouble. Oh, and the kids are growing up too, and Kurt needs to deal with the fact that his daughter is dating somebody that he doesn't particularly like.Look, this one wasn't anywhere near as good as the last one, but it was still pretty enjoyable. Obviously we have more characters, since we are in a small town as opposed to a lakeside retreat, and the conclusion is pretty good as well. I liked how it came out that their kids did in fact has some hidden talents as well, but I guess that has something to do with it being one of those Hollywood films where things do need to turn out right once in a while. Another thing that I appreciated was Sandler's rather casual and laid back nature, which certainly stands out from the image of a stuffy Hollywood agent - and also the fact that he was more than happy to drive the school bus when needed - yeah there were some pretty cool scenes, and the fact that it was just about friends being, well, friends, is what I really did like about these two films.Sure, the critics weren't all that thrilled with it, but in the end what really counts was the box office, and that certainly put the critic's opinons to shame."

Three years later, a sequel features many of the same cast in a plot less series of character threads and vignettes, much of which is childish, crude, slapstick, halfwitted, lazy, and occasionally sentimental.Make no mistake, this is not a very good film. But I wouldn't be fair if I didn't make three points: One, Sandler makes many films where his character is profoundly annoying (I mean fingernails scraping down blackboard annoying). Here his character is likable.Two, this film doesn't have as much outright cruelty in the humour as its predecessor.And, three, I hate to admit it, but it made me (and the cinema audience) laugh quite a bit."
tt2191701,5.0,About the same as the first one. It had some laughs (not a lot but some).
tt2191701,6.0,"Grown Ups 2 is an alright movie with basically no storylione,just one joke after another,but a very fun cast that are all clearly close friends.I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as I enjoyed the first Grown Ups,I thought the first one had tons of very funny scenes that turned out really good and that it was very underrated by critics,but there are a lot more misses in this one.My biggest problem was that there was too much childish humor (fart jokes,toilet humor,etc) and that Taylor Lutner was in it too much and Andy Samberg wasn't in it enough,when you get a big and funny star like him in your movie,you don't give him a brief cameo were he dosen't even speak.Still there was a lot of funny scenes,mostly from Adam Sandler,Chris Rock,Kevin James and David Spade,and they should have been in it a lot more instead of having a lot of it focus on their kids.If you enjoyed the first Grown Ups,you will be disappointed,but you will still laugh a lot.The gang prepare for a great summer in their hometown and reunite with some old friends and enemies."
tt2191701,6.0,"This film tells the story of a group of childhood friends who throws a huge eighties party to recapture the spirit of their youth.""Grown Ups 2"" is full of gross toilet humor and juvenile jokes, but I guess I was in the mood for silliness so I enjoyed watching it. The story is very fragmented, as the film is composed of a series of little connected, one minute to a few minutes long jokes. As a result, there is virtually no plot, but a series of funny scenes thrown together to call a film. However, this idea works and people find the film funny, so why not give prior the escapism entertainment? ""Grown Ups 2"" is not as annoying as the first film, but equally forgettable and hollow."
tt2191701,5.0,This is one of those films what you wonder what is going on because there really isn't much of a plot but there are quite a number of funny jokes that are worth watching this movie for.If you are bored and this is on the boob-tube - give it a try!5/10.
tt2191701,6.0,"Like the first part it is just a fine comedy. Story? I think there was none. It is a movie where series of fun scenes attached together which becomes the 'Grown Ups 2'. Yeah like the movie 'Jackass', nothing much difference between these two except one was rated PG13 and other were R.At least the first movie was somehow enjoyable, this movie completely failed to attract with its comedies. I think Adam Sandler's sense of humour is no longer effective like he was a decade ago. The combined star power was the key to this movie which made watchable. Hope there won't be a third. In my opinion it is a one time watchable and nothing to praise, more like a watching the 'Just for laugh: Gags' program on the television.6/10"
tt10168670,5.0,"I adore the three lead actors chosen for this film. They're absolute powerhouses in every story they take part in, and this is no exception. Here, they embody their characters with subtlety and an eerie yet graceful presence that allowed me to see them as simultaneously monstrous and sympathetic.There's quite a lot that Bones and All has to love, from the cinematography to the many powerful scenes that focus on Maren's struggle with whether or not she's a monster who deserves to be alone.It's just a shame that I don't think the film every really hits the mark on what it's trying to convey.This adapted screenplay skirts around the moral implications of these cannibalistic characters' actions without ever really nailing down a purpose for it all.There are two or three wonderful scenes in which their horrific and brutal actions are discussed; Maren doesn't want to have these desires, while Lee embraces them. The conflict is there, and it's tangible, but it never goes beyond this point.For most of the movie, nobody's boundaries are pushed. Every contentious moment either has a rapid resolution or is forgotten and not resolved at all.The events of the story play out and the impact that they have on the characters is...never really felt. I never really felt anything because the characters just seem to move on from each happening like nothing happened at all.There isn't really a sense of cause and effect from scene to scene. Beautiful images and captivating performances just appear and disappear on screen until the movie is over.If the writing had been tighter and the characters felt more involved in their own story, it could have been truly special. Instead, I'll forget it rather quickly."
tt10168670,6.0,"Starts off like any other coming of age movie then gets pretty gore real quick. It's basically a travel blog movie with narration. Even for a cannibalist movie all the characters seem to act unnaturally, maybe that's just how they were meant to be acted out since these aren't your normal folk. It's a movie that you might want to know what it's about heading in. I didn't really, but I'm luckily not the faint of heart but I can see people coming out saying it's disgusting or vile just like Flesh which was an earlier(and better imo) addition in the genre from this year.Even for what the movie was about it was unnecessarily bloody, which made it seem over the top so that didn't really feel real to me, less believable graphic and gruel. For a while I thought it'd end up as something like a crossover between American honey and ladybird; in a way it is although it never gets as good as either of those. It's less horror, more like a road trip love story, has an interesting premise but it doesn't make the most of it. It's just floating in the middle, could've been more romantic, more unsettling, or more peculiar, lacks all around passion.It feels a little like a dystopian future, because it mostly follows eaters only and they all have unique colorful personalities or appearances so this is how the world's perceived; yet it's all in the 80's America.The romance side of it made sense, but the chemistry didn't feel believable. Similar to CMBYN which people did love though. The movie lacks any depth and the characters feel paper thin. It made sense for the lead characters to end up together but I didn't care much for them, so when the emotional scenes come it felt empty. It is visually appealing with beautiful camerawork of the scenery, quite some focus was to the red hair as the color stuck out from everything else. So I've watched two of Luca Guadagnino works now and I don't know if his trademark is beautifully made but hallow movies. You could deduce something meaningful behind it all but I think it'd be reaching. The actors did as well as you'd expect with what they're given. Most of them having worked with Luca before.Cannibalism aside, I see a lot of similarities to call me by your name, I think this movie had a lot more to offer, I expected more but just like CMBYN, maybe I just don't get it and people will find beauty and meaning in this and I am just the one who doesn't get it.UPDATE: Yup, just what I expected is happening. People talking about how beautifully shot this is, every scene worth bearing resemblance to a painting. And it's all true, it is visually appealing but it just feels hallow and lacking intimacy as I don't feel the connection between characters. I guess it's my life's tragedy that I'll never understand the hype around Luca Guadagnino's works. I enviously read the reviews praising CMBYN and Bones and all, wishing I could see what they see."
tt10168670,5.0,"As a massive admirer of Luca Guadagnino's work, it saddens me to say that Bones & All is disappointing.Even though the cinematography and atmosphere are beautiful and what you would expect from the visual master, the film suffers from tonal shifts and a very talky script that is only saved by a fantastic turn by Mark Rylance. His menacing presence is the feature only redeeming quality.The narrative is overstretched by a terribly slow pace reinforced by wooden dialogues between lovers that don't have much chemistry to begin with. Timothée Chalamet is clearly miscast as his sweet and soft demeanor don't match with the supposed danger and inner violence of his character.Star of the show, Taylor Russell is beautiful and haunting. She also carries much of the movie on her frail shoulder. But the underdeveloped family moments and repetitive travel adventures don't help to build much of her personality. So when we get to the core horror aspect of the movie it mostly fails. Most ""gory"" moments are contrived, shoehorned inside the romance. They are too few, tonally all over the place and end up underwhelming.After the masterful Suspiria, I was really expecting Guadagnino to deliver on the horror front but I think he got sucked away by the gorgeous landscapes and forgot to build up tension or fear. Bones & All ultimately ends up being a tiresome teen romance road trip interrupted by bizarre gory scenes. I will just rewatch Kathryn Bigelow's masterpiece ""Near Dark"" which I think would have been the perfect inspiration."
tt10168670,5.0,"I saw it for Timothée Chalamet. And his work is just admirable. But the great job is offered by absolutely impressive Mark Rylance, giving a version of evil absolutely fantastic.No doubts, Taylor Russell represents the perfect option for role of Maurene.One of virtues - the atmosphere of Reagan United States. In same measure, the touch, especially in the meetings, of South Gothic. Another virtue - the gentle poeetry, the travel becoming, in some measure, scene by scene, yours. The exploration of family, in the perspective of young adults is another good point.The sin - maybe, the paradoxal hurry, the characters remaining more sketches .But , indeed, a beautiful film, deserving the atention each minute from its two hours."
tt10168670,5.0,"I had high expectations for this film given some of the cast, especially Timothée Chalamet, who never disappoints. I was really excited to see this movie given the controversial and disturbing topic that attempts to combine romance with its horror. I am so frustrated by the fact that I truly believe this could've been ""a win for cinema"", as a famous critic has stated the movie was. I felt like all the pieces of the puzzle were there, but they didn't make a picture. Like others have said, there were so many plot holes, build-ups that lead to nothing, and cramped scenes with little time to involve yourself in the characters. The connection between Maren and Lee didn't feel believable, nor did it feel like they were given enough screen time to make that happen.It felt like the director tried to capture too much in 2 hours and it ended up being a scattered slideshow of artsy scenes with gore and confusion. The 5/10 stars I give is for the acting, mainly on the part of Chalamet and Rylance. My other 5 is lost to the direction, editing, and script of the film.The trailer and hype was 10x better than the movie itself, so all you need to watch is that. This could've been a true masterpiece, and I desperately wanted it to be. I found myself trying to be convinced it was good, but ultimately faced the honesty that it fell through. A chance for beauty, lost to the wind."
tt10168670,6.0,"I had no idea what this film was about nor who was in it so I went in totally blind. It was a little slow to take up the pace, but the instant Maren bit her school friends finger I knew I was into it.I didn't recognise Russel at first, or Rylance, or Sevigny! But Rylance completely blew me out of the water with his understated performance.I've never seen Chalament act but he is such an engaging young man, he really took his part.There were some empty spaces in the plot, but while I saw them they did not harm the film in anyway. I loved how the narrative circled the actors like vultures waiting for a rabbit to die, but never actually settling.I am not going to rave about this film but I gave it my base 6 which is recognition of a very enjoyable film."
tt6806448,5.0,"Hobbs and Shaw (Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham) reluctantly join forces to try and find Shaw's sister Hattie (Vanessa Kirby), who is carrying a deadly virus in her bloodstream that will become active in 72 hours. Also trying to track down Hattie is technologically enhanced villain Brixton (Idris Elba), who intends to use the virus to cleanse the Earth of the weak.With every subsequent Fast & Furious movie, the franchise has steered further and further away from its street racing roots, becoming more and more like any other mega-budget action series: full of incredible stunts, massive explosions and hard-hitting fights. Spin-off Hobbs & Shaw sees the F&F universe enter science fiction and fantasy territory: sci-fi because of the futuristic technology involved (which includes a transformer style motorbike ridden by its cyborg villain), and fantasy because of the impossible nature of the stunts which defy all the laws of physics. Oh, and a Samoan mechanic has the know-how to fix a high-tech computerised gizmo, the likes of which he would never have seen before. Magic has got to be involved somewhere!The crazy action includes the following: a high speed chase through the streets of London during which both a car and the super-bike slide under not one but two moving trucks; an armoured buggy doing a 360 degree roll through the air, landing on the roof of a building; and an extremely silly finalé in which several vehicles are daisy-chained together to prevent a helicopter from escaping. It's cheesy over-the-top blockbuster nonsense designed to be as outrageously daft as possible, and might be reasonably fun, if it wasn't for the endless, supposedly comedic banter between its two stars, which results in a bloated runtime of well over two hours -- far too long for a film of this type."
tt6806448,6.0,"The movie was very good. I enjoyed it. But there was one big thing That's been bugging me: I wish eiza Gonzalez had more screen time!!! Eiza had her name part of the main cast list and she's part of the poster for the movie and yet eiza and her character madam M were only in the movie for 5 mins. That's not right! (Ok to be fair, she's was already working on another movie ""bloodshot"" at that time. So she only flew to london, to be in Hobbs & Shaw for a couple of days) still, I love, enjoyed, appreciated and praised every single second of eiza's scenes, her performance and character so so very much. Madam M and all other different characters eiza had played recently and so far. (Even though they were small roles and one or two earlier movies she was in are not my favorites) but still, I love eiza with all my heart & soul and everything she has done so far. Hope they'll be a sequel to Hobbs & Shaw and eiza comes back as madam M, has more screen time and is more involved because eiza deserves it 100%
I love you eiza Gonzalez!!!"
tt6806448,6.0,"HOBBS & SHAW is the first spin-off from the FAST & FURIOUS franchise not to feature Vin Diesel, but it turns out you don't miss him at all. This is because the entire film consists of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham engaging in verbal sparring and constant insults, some of which are pretty stupid, but many of which are witty. They certain sound good in the mouths of these two enthusiastic actors and they have a real camaraderie missing in many modern buddy-buddy comedies. Aside from these guys, you get a typically bombastic and unrealistic plotline involving Idris Elba's generic supervillain, a lot of globetrotting, and typically CGI enhanced vehicle chases. It's not remotely believable, but that doesn't really matter as this is all about OTT mayhem and humorous lines in between. Plenty of fight scenes add to the fun, although it's a shame about some of the performances, but generally this works."
